                               Apple Butter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  apples
  1                cup  apple cider -- to 2 cups
  1                cup  sugar -- more or less

I make apple butter in my crock pot and it is very easy and very tasty. Usually I use 3 pounds of Jonathan apples which I wash, core and chunk into a 3 quart crock pot. I add about 1 to 2 cups apple cider (sometimes I use just water) and cook on low til mushy. I chop the apples (peel and all) and run through a sieve and return to the crock pot. I add about 1 cup sugar (or more depending on taste preference), cover and cook on high til bubbly. I then remove the lid and cook on high til apples turn dark brown and thicken.

Pour into jelly jars and put in refrigerator or freezer - after they cool. Tastes good on everything from biscuits to toast to even ice cream.

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads: Quick & Muffins


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  shortening
     1/3           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  applesauce

1. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, sugar,
allspice, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Using a pastry blender, cut in
shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center
of dry mixture. In a small mixing bowl, combine buttermilk and applesauce;
add to dry mixture all at once. Using a fork, stir just until moistened.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Quickly knead dough by
gently folding and pressing 10 to 12 strokes or until dough is nearly smooth.
Pat or lightly roll dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut dough with a 2 1/2-inch
biscuit cutter.
3. Place biscuits 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a
450F  oven 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. Remove biscuits from the baking
sheet and serve warm.

TO MAKE AHEAD: Prepare and bake biscuits as directed; cool completely. Place
biscuits in a freezer container or bag and freeze up to 3 months. To serve,
wrap frozen biscuits in foil and bake in a 300F oven 20  to 25 minutes
or until warm.

  1 1/2           cups  all purpose flour
     3/4          tsp.  baking powder
                        Enough water
                        oil to fry
                        sugar and cinnamon
                        melted butter to dip in ( optional )

Heat one inch or more of oil in a heavy duty pot or small skillet ( 7 to 9 inches ) to 360F ..

Meanwhile mix flour and baking powder and then mix in enough water ( around 1 cup ) until a thick batter forms. Drop the batter by a spoonfuls or ladle into the hot oil, spreading batter as thin as possible with back of spoon so batter almost fills the pot.This will give you a large disc. Or you can make smaller "puffs" just by dropping by heaping tablespoonfuls.

Fry until browned on each side ( try to turn only once ). Drain on paper towels. Dust heavily with granulated sugar mixed with cinnamon. Or dip in melted butter then in sugar.Serve immediately.Yield: puffy bread; amounts depend on the size of the dough being fried. Large discs result in 2 or 3 breads in my 7 1/2 inch pot , many more when fried as puffs.

You can double the recipe if desired.You might want to add a dash of salt to the recipe if desired.

NOTES : The following recipe for this fry bread is as simple as one can get. We enjoy it with heavy sprinkles of sugar and cinnamon. It was given to me years ago and I don't know the details of the origin. I enjoy unusual bread and baking recipes and will try to post them from time to time.

NOTES : Thank you for your e-mail to the Augusta County School System. Since I am the Food Service Director for the school system, your request for the bread recipe got passed on to me. You didn't say in what year you graduated from the county schools. You see, over the past several years the county has been using a menu cycle designed by Va. Tech to cut down on fat and calories in the school lunches. I bet this comes as no surprise. Anyway, what I am saying is that our current roll recipe may not provide the "rich" memories of when you were in school.What I am sending to you is the "old" school roll recipe. Hope this is helpful.

NOTES : Jennifer, this second roll recipe makes about 60 turnovers. It comes from my mother who was a school cafeteria manager for 18 years. - Mother uses that Better for Bread flour made by Gold Medal - Also she uses 9-10 cups of flour so she will have a softer dough. Mother always says, "The dough has to feel right."

Jennifer, if you remember the school cinnamon rolls, you will be glad to hear that this dough recipe is also used to make the cinnamon rolls.

  4               cups  Unbleached White Flour

  4                Tsp  Vital Wheat Gluten
  1 1/2            Tsp  Dry Yeast
  1 1/4           cups  Warm Water
                        (80 - 90F)

These are the kind of bagels my New York City wife says she remembers
eating as a child.

Mix flour, salt malt, vital wheat gluten, yeast & water in bowl of mixer
with regular beater at the lowest speed for about 4 minutes.  Then switch
to the dough hook & increase the speed to 2.  Continue mixing until dough
is cohesive & stiff, 8-10 minutes.

Turn dough on to work surface; divide into 8 portions, about 4 ounces
each.  Roll pieces into smooth balls & cover with a towel or plastic wrap
to rest for 10 minutes.

Roll dough balls into a rope approx 11-inches long.  Overlap the ends of
the rope about 1-inch & wet the ends & then pinch the overlapped area together.

Place the bagels on a teflon coated sheet or cornmeal dusted parchment
covered baking sheet.  Cover tightly with foil.  Refrigerate overnight.
(12-18 hours).

The next morning take the bagels out of the refrigerator & let stand for
approx 20 minutes.  Drop the bagels into a kettle of boiling water & let
sit there for approx 45 seconds & then turn over with a chinese skimmer or
a slotted spoon letting them sit for another 45 seconds.

Preheat oven to 450F.  Set rack to center position.  Apply toppings to the
bagels and place the bagels on the baking sheet.  Bake for approx 20 minutes.

You can use your bread-making machine to make these also--just use the
dough only setting & take the dough out before any rising cycle starts.

  TOPPINGS:

  2 tb of sesame seeds
  poppy seeds,
  sunflower seeds
  1 tb each of caraway seeds,sea or kosher salt
  dehydrated onion
  dehydrated garlic flakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- (4 to 4 1/2)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water  (120 - 130F)
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1                     egg -- beaten

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour and the yeast. Add the
warm water, the 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt. Beat with an electric mixer on
low to medium speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl. Beat on high speed 3 minutes.
Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can.

2. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to
make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes
total). Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Grease 2 baking sheets; set aside.

3. Working quickly, divide dough into 12 portions. Shape each portion into a
smooth ball. Cover; let rest 5 minutes. With a floured finger, punch a 2-inch
hole in center of each, keeping a uniform shape. Place bagels 2 inches apart
on prepared baking sheets. Reshape so holes are 2 inches in diameter. Cover;
let rise 20 minutes (start timing after first bagel is shaped).

4. Broil raised bagels 5 inches from heat 3 to 4 minutes or until bagels look
set, turning once (tops should not brown). Meanwhile, in a 12-inch skillet or
4 1/2-quart Dutch oven, bring 6 cups of water and the 1 tablespoon sugar to
boiling. Reduce heat; simmer bagels, 4 or 5 at a time, 7 minutes, turning
once. Drain on paper towels. Let stand on towels only a few seconds. (If left
too long, they will stick.)

5. Place drained bagels 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Brush
bagels with beaten egg. Bake in a 375F oven 20 to 25 minutes or until
tops are golden. Remove from baking sheets; cool on wire racks. Place in an
airtight container and store at room temperature for up to 2 days.

EGG BAGELS: Prepare Bagels as directed, except reduce warm water to 1 1/4
cups. Add 2 egg yolks to the flour mixture along with the warm water.

ONION BAGELS: Prepare Bagels as directed, except omit brushing with egg. Cook
1/2 cup finely chopped onion in 3 tablespoons butter or margarine until
tender but not brown. Brush bagels with onion mixture after the first 15
minutes of baking.

POPPY SEED OR SESAME BAGELS: Prepare Bagels as directed, except before
baking, sprinkle with 2 teaspoons poppy seed or toasted sesame seed.

LIGHT RYE BAGELS: Prepare Bagels as directed, except substitute 1 1/4 cups
rye flour for 1 1/4 cups of the stirred-in all-purpose flour. Stir in 1
teaspoon caraway seed with the rye flour.

WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS: Prepare Bagels as directed, except substitute 1 1/2 cups
whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 cups of the stirred-in all-purpose flour.

* TO MAKE AHEAD: Prepare Bagels as directed; cool completely. Place bagels in
a freezer container or bag and freeze up to 3 months. Before serving, thaw
bagels at room temperature for several hours.

Add yeast, salt, bread flour, egg substitute, and 1/2 cup water in the order suggested by the bread machine manufacturer and process on the dough cycle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray baking sheet with nonfat cooking spray. When the dough cycle is complete, remove dough and place on lightly-floured surface. Roll dough into 12x4-inch rectangle and cut into 8 (12-inch) strips. Pull each strip to about 14 inches in length. Form dough into pretzel shape: Make a circle; cross the ends at the top, twist the ends once and lay over the bottom of the circle. Pretzel logs can also be shaped just by making rolled dough into a 12- to 14-inch rope. Place pretzels on prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine egg white with 1 tablespoon water and brush on pretzels. If desired, sprinkle pretzels with coarse salt, sesame, or poppy seeds. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20 seconds. Serve with mustard or cheese dip.

Baking Tips:

1.Consistent Crust
2.Crust Colour

TIP #1 Consistent Crust

Always allow sufficient time for the dough to rise, but do not let it over rise.
Carefully measure your ingredients. Too much flour, or too little sugar or fat, can toughen your crust.
Doughs made with water generally yield a crispier crust than those made with milk.
To soften a crust, brush crust with melted butter as soon as it comes out of the oven.
Cool bread completely, and then place in a plastic bag.

TIP #2 Crust Colour

Aluminum pans reflect rather than transmit heat and can result in a more pale loaf. Try using a baking pan made from something other than aluminum. For a darker, richer colour, brush finished loaves lightly with butter or margarine and return to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Position pans in the oven so that they are evenly exposed to the oven temperature, allowing air to circulate between the loaves. Bake on a lower oven rack, unless otherwise directed. If crust is becoming too brown, cover loosely with aluminum foil during the last 10 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9               cups  unbleached flour
  3               cups  water
  3               tbsp  molasses
  3                tsp  dry active yeast
  3                tsp  salt
  3               tbsp  oil

I call it the recipe of threes. I often substitute 3 of the cups of whole wheat flour for the unbleached. You can also use up to 1 cup of any combination of non-wheat flours. My favorite is 1/4 cup of each oatmeal, rice, and soy flours. Measure half of the flour (whole wheat goes in here) into a large bowl. Form a well in the center. Stir the molasses into all of the water and pour the mixture into the well. Sprinkle on the yeast and wait until yeast softens. Beat until batter is smooth, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover and let sit overnight. In the morning, mix in the rest of the flour, the salt and the oil. Stir until you can't stir any more (this is the hardest part). By now the dough should be clearing the sides of the bowl. Turn out dough and knead until smooth. Put in bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk. If you poke the dough and it doesn't poke back, it's ready! Turn dough out and divide into two (large) loaves or three smaller ones. Form into loaves and place in greased loaf pans. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place risen dough in hot oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until loaves have pulled away from the sides of the pans. Let cool a bit and enjoy! My latest project has been working with sourdough bread. More on that later.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  800            grams  Rye flour
  200            grams  coarse whole wheat flour
  21             grams  fresh yeast
  600      milliliters  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  Salt
  50             grams  melted but cooled margarine
                        some meal
  50                 g  coarse chopped sunflower seeds
                        milk sunflower seeds

Mix the flours in a large bowl. Dissolve the yeast in a well in the center of the flour with 3 TBS water. Sprinkle salt on dry flour. Add margarine and rest of water and stir with a spoon until smooth. Turn onto work surface and knead 10 to 15 minutes. Form into a ball. Place into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a towel. Allow to rise in a warm spot for 50 to 60 minutes. Knead a second time and work in the sunflower seeds.
 Oil a baking sheet, form a log from the dough and brush with milk. Allow to rise about 15 minutes in a warm area. Preheat oven to 400F or so. Place a water filled container in the oven for steam. Bake bread for 45 -50 minutes. 10 minutes before the end of baking, brush with milk again and sprinkle remaining seeds. Spritz loaf with water as soon as it comes out of the oven to develop crust.

The weights aren't all that critical. If you uses your normal amount of yeast, it will be OK. I don't know how much is in a package but you can adjust the rising time to match the amount of yeast used. Don't add to much flour as a rye bread stays sticky longer than wheat does.

Pizza, Focaccia, Filled and Flatbreads From Your Bread Machine Perfect
Every Time, Lora Brody

Here's a recipe that I developed for my book (Pizza, Focaccia, etc, etc,
 From Your Bread Machine Perfect Every Time). I have to caution you that
you'll  probably never be able to match exactly the taste and texture of a
real NY  bialy, but these get exponentially better as the distance between
you and NY  City increases.

You can get a free sample of my Bread Dough Enhancer and Relaxer by
emailing me at blanche007@aol.com:  Lora Brody

Prepare the dough in either a bread machine, stand mixer or food processor,
kneading until a soft, supple ball forms.  Rest 15 minutes, then knead
for  another 3-4 minutes.  Rise in a warm place until double.  Meanwhile
prepare  the filling:

Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the onions until they are limp and
translucent.  Off the heat stir in the poppy seeds and salt.  Cool to
room  temperature.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured board.  One key to success is not to
skimp on the flour.  Cut the dough into 3 equal pieces and roll each into
a  6" rope.  Cut each rope into 3 equal parts and roll each into a
ball.   Sprinkle the balls with flour, cover them with a clean dish towel
and let  them rest for 10 minutes.

Sprinkle two heavy duty baking sheets liberally with cornmeal.  Flatten
each ball into a 4-5 inch circle.  Place the circles on the prepared sheets
about,  leaving about an inch of space between each.  Sprinkle with flour,
cover with  the dish towel and let them rise 15 minutes.  Preheat the oven
to 450F  with the rack in the center position.  Use your fingers to firmly
push in the  center of each circle to form a 1/2" deep well about 2"
across.  Fill  the  well with the onion filling.  Cover and rise 10
minutes. Just before placing  the sheets in the oven use your fingers to
push the indented onion-filled  area down one more time.

Bake the bialys 17-20 minutes of until they are puffed up and just get
slightly browned.  Eat hot or warm or toasted after they have been cooled.

  1                Tsp  Sugar
  2 1/2            Tsp  Kosher Salt -- Or
                        (Other Coarse Salt, Such As Sea Salt)
  4 1/2           cups  High Protein Bread Flour -- (To 5 C)

     1/3          cups  Minced Onion
     1/2           Tsp  Salt

In large mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup warm water, yeast, & sugar and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix remaining warm water, salt, and flour into yeast mixture. Knead until smooth (the dough will be soft). Place dough ball in a greased bowl, turn it around and place with greased side up. Let rise, cover with plastic until tripled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down, turn it over, cover and let rise until doubled. Punch dough down and roll into 2 cylinders. Cut each into 8 rounds. Lay them flat, cover with a towel and let rest.

Prepare topping by mixing all topping ingredients. Set aside. Preheat oven to 425F.

Pat dough into flattened rounds (a little higher in middle). about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Place on lightly floured board,cover with a dry towel and then a damp towel and let rise until increased by about half in bulk (half proofed), about 30 minutes.

When risen, press bottom of small shot glass in center of each bialy, to make deep flat half dollar size indentation in bialy. Let rise another 15 minutes. (DO NOT LET THEM DOUBLE).

Put bialys on ungreased baking sheets. Fill each indentation with about 1 to 2 tablespoons of the topping, but do not spread over the rest of the roll. Bake on upper and lower shelves of the oven for 6 to 7 minutes, then switch pans and reverse positions of pans (front to back) until bialys are evenly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes more. If the indentation disappears while baking because the dough springs up too high, pull out of oven, mash down the center carefully with a spoon and return any onion mixture that's spilled out. Return to oven to finish baking. Bialys should be lightly browned. Cool completely on racks.

When reheated in the oven just before serving, hey should be crisp, crunchy and delicious, and the onion should be thoroughly translucent and somewhat caramelized. If you don't eat them all up (unlikely), wrap them in a tightly closed plastic bag and freeze. Reheat directly in oven.

NOTES : There is a recipe that I've been having an unusual amount of difficulty finding. They are called BIALYS (pronounced bee-ah-lee). I may be off on the spelling. I think they are Jewish. They are in most NYC bagel stores that do their own baking. They are the size of a bagel except there is no hole. The center is pressed flat and some onion and/or garlic and other spices are sprinkled in the center. The dough seems more like pizza crust than like a bagel.
This recipe ought to work. When I was a kid, we always bought these at a bakery about a 5 minute walk from home in Massachusetts, and I assumed that they were available everywhere until I got a little older and found out that not everyone is Jewish. They've got to be eaten fresh and hot, or at least reheated within a day or two of baking. Stick them in the oven and crisp them up good, slather a little butter on them and eat 'em up.

  1              Pinch  Salt

I have made many versions of bialys (usually disappointed by most) but the
recipe in George Greenstein's book, "Secrets of a Jewish Baker" is
the  closest yet. I would definitely recommend buying the book if you want
to try  and reproduce some of the New York style breads. The flavor and
moistness  achieved by using altus (soaked pieces of rye bread, then
squeezed out) in  his NY Rye made the loaf very close to what I grew up
eating. If anyone can  suggest how to make a loaf of rye or pumpernickle
have a more domed, rather  than flat, shape I'd appreciate it.

Combine topping ingredients and set aside.

In a large bowl sprinkle yeast over the warm water to soften; stir to
dissolve. Add the sugar, 6 cups of flour, and salt. Mix thoroughly until
dough forms up and comes away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead, adding small
amounts of flour as needed, for 10 to 12 minutes.

Shape the dough into a ball; place in a large oiled bowl and turn to coat.
Cover and allow to rise 30 minutes. Press out all of the air with your
fingers and allow to rise until doubled in size (20-30 minutes).

Punch down the dough, divide into thirds, roll out under your palms into
ropes, and cut each rope in 6 equal pieces. Roll into balls. Cover and
allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes.

Roll out each ball into a 3 1/2 inch circle. If the dough becomes too stiff
or shrinks back, allow it to rest and go on to the next piece.

Evenly space the circles on 2 floured or cornmeal dusted baking pans. Cover
with flour rubbed cloths and allow to rise until puffy. Make an indentation
from the center outward, leaving a 1-inch rim. A shot glass with a 1"
bottom also works well. Press with a circular motion. Dribble bit of the
reserved topping into the hole. Dust lightly with reserved flour. Cover
with cloths and allow to proof until puffed up.

Bake without steam in a preheated 450F oven for 15-20 minutes.

Make 18 bialys.

You may have to play with the recipe a bit, for example, I form them into
15 bialys...guess the bakers in my neighborhood were a bit more generous!

                    Bread Flour Vs. All-Purpose Flour

                        *****

What flour should you use? Easy bread flour, bread flour contains more of the protein called gluten. It is this gluten protein that allows the dough to capture and trap more of the gases given off by the yeast. Gluten when activated with moisture becomes rubbery and elastic. It is this rubbery structure that allows it to stretch and keep trapped the yeast gases. Without an ample supply of gluten in your bread dough your bread will not rise as high, be as light or as tender. All-Purpose flour has between 3 to 4 grams less gluten protein in it than bread flour. Bread flour is made from hard winter wheat and it is this type of wheat that gives bread flour its ability to make good bread.

All-Purpose Flour is usually made up of hard winter wheat and soft spring wheat. That is why it works so well for so many different types of baked goods. It has just enough gluten to work for a number of baked good, but not really enough for good bread. If you wish to use all-purpose flour you may do so. However, you should add a tablespoon of Vital Wheat Gluten (not Gluten Flour) to your dough for every cup of all-purpose used. You can get the Vital Wheat Gluten at most large grocery stores and health food stores. The best and the cheapest way to go is to by bread flour. If you live in Canada your flour is even higher in Gluten and you should have no problems using all-purpose type flours. Robin Hood flour is excellent quality and works very well. In the US, I like the bread flour I get at my local Costco wholesale club, 25 pounds for $4.50. Any US sold bread flour will do.

There are times when you will want to use a combination of bread flour and all-purpose flour. Pizza crust, dinner or sandwich rolls are very good candidates for a 50/50 mix. The all-purpose prevents the dough from becoming too rubbery so it makes a more tender flexible dough. This can be very important when making pizza crust. With a 50/50 mix the crust will be much easier to roll out. For the ultimate pizza crust use 50% bread flour and 50% pastry or cake flour, this will give you an easy to shape, light tender crust.

                Rolls                           White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all purpose flour -- plus more if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast
                        -- (1/4 ounce -- 2 1/4 teaspoons)
  1                cup  very warm water
                        -- (about 120 degrees F)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided

1) in a large bowl, combine the flour & salt; set aside. In a small bowl dissolve the sugar & yeast in the water. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the water, then add to flour. mix with your hands until a soft ball forms. ~I use a Kitchen Aid for a variety of reasons, the primary reason is cos it's fast & easy~

2) Knead on a lightly floured surface for 5 to 7 minutes. ~I use corn meal~ until the dough is smooth & elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time

3) place the dough in a bowl that has been coated with nonstick vegetable spray. turn the dough. Cover with plastic wrap & allow to rise at room temperature for 45 to 50 minutes, until doubled in size. ~at this point turn your oven down to 425 degrees & _carefully_ add more water if necessary - at this point I'll shape them - I roll them in the corn meal & place them on a cookie sheet that has been sprayed with something like Pam. I have also rolled them in grated Parmesan cheese (you know, the stuff in the jar) for a different flavor. I allow them to rise (they seem to fairly quickly for me) for about 20 minutes, bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees or until browned on the top~

4) Punch the dough down.

5) coat a 12 inch deep-dish pizza pan or a 12 inch round cake pan with nonstick vegetable spray. using your fingertips or the heel of your hand, spread the dough so that it covers the bottom of the pan & dough comes three quarters of the way up the sides. ~when I use this recipe to make pizza, I roll it out - it rolls out wonderfully~

6) cover with plastic wrap & let sit for 10 minutes

7) uncover & brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil

I then bake it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, fill it with pizza fixings & return it to the oven til the cheese melts or browns, depends on who the pizza is for - about 10-15 minutes...

NOTES : Regarding "Bread Bowls". I thought you might be interested in this Bread Formula.
Professionally, I've made literally 100's of these and they are just GREAT! The same formula is also excellent as Dark, "American Style" Rye; just bake them at a hotter temperature (450 1/4 F +/-) for 40-or more minutes.
When making the SOUPIERS, be sure to place a dough button (the size of a nickel-approx.) on the top of the rounded loaf and "glue" it (them) in place with a dab of egg-wash to hold the "buttons" in place while proofing.
Bake SOUPIERS at 450 1/4 F. (or less for a longer time to harden the SOUPIERS).
To serve, cut the tops off - about the size of a grapefruit - and then hollow-out the softer insides.
One can now fill the SOUPIERS with your choice of SOUP.

  12                    eggs -- colored *
                        ---
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1               tsp.  salt

  1                     egg -- beaten, for wash
                        Multi-colored decors

* EGG NOTE: First you have to decide about the eggs. Traditionally, you dye raw eggs and they cook in the oven right in the middle of the bread. This is fabulous (and amazing!) if you're going to serve the bread right away as breakfast or brunch. However, I usually found that the yolks were still a little "fudgy" -- fine when hot and probably being slathered with butter, salt & pepper, but not so fine if served room temperature later on. As I have been making these for grade-schoolers for some years now, I have taken the chance of over-cooked yolks and hard-boiled the eggs first. I don't get many eggs back, so it must be OK! (N.B.: I find that simple, all-one-color eggs are all this presentation needs; fancier ones wouldn't hurt, but it's up to you if it's worth the egg-stra effort...)

Next, decide on your presentation: rainbow rings (6 eggs in a round "braid"), baskets (eggs in a bread ring, with or without "handle" across the middle), or bunnies. Now you'll know what to do at the end!

Decor note: You can use the tiny multi-colored hard sugar balls that decorate cakes and cookies so well, jimmies, sparkly sugar, or the flat sugar shapes (King Arthur has had a "barnyard mix" which is great -- pink pigs, yellow chicks, green ducks, white rabbits and, so help me, shiny brown cows!) which you otherwise might sprinkle on cupcake tops. Whatever isn't too big to stick onto the egg glaze.

Now, for the bread:

Scald the milk; add sugar, salt, butter & lemon oil or peel. Cook to lukewarm (it's good to toss it into your big mixing bowl if that bowl needs to be warmed up!). Sprinkle yeast on top of the warm water, stir to dissolve. Add to milk mixture along with the 2 eggs and 2 1/2 cups of flour.
 Beat until smooth (120 strokes is traditional and effective).

Stir in enough of the remaining flour, a little at a time, to form a dough that is easy to handle. turn onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, 5-8 minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl; turn dough over to grease top. cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down, turn, cover & let rise again until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare baking sheets (full-sized cookie sheets hold six individual breads -- bunnies or baskets -- or one braid) by coating with cooking spray or covering the baking sheet with parchment paper.

for individual breads:
Divide into 12 even portions. Roll out a portion between your hands into an 8-10" rope. Cut off about a quarter of the rope if making bunnies, about an eighth if making baskets with handles. Pinch remaining dough into a circle, securing dough well. Put an egg onto the prepared baking sheet, and stretch the dough around it. If you've reserved some dough, roll it into a long enough rope to make the basket handle or two bunny ears (make it long, cut in half, fold it double; pinch into bottom of bread ring above one long end of egg).

For rainbow rings:

Roll bread out into two ropes as long as possible. Leaving "tails" about long enough to go around the last egg, cross the two ropes and put one end of an egg against the joint, running lengthwise. Make the ropes cross over/under at the end of the egg and place the next egg at the joint of the ropes. Keep on truckin' until you get to the sixth egg. If you're truly compulsive (as I am) you will have, of course, arranged the eggs in rainbow order so there's no beginning or end to the color wheel. As you tuck the last egg into the last of the ropes, pinch the ends together securely.

Brush assembled breads with beaten egg. Let rise until doubled. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375F.

Brush breads with egg wash again, sprinkle on decorations as desired (pink sugar down the crease of the bunny ears is very charming). Bake individual breads 20-25 minutes; rainbow rings 30-40 minutes.

Baskets can be removed from pans promptly. WAIT 10-15 minutes on bunnies and rings, so the bread can set up a little. Then, remove to a cooling rack (or serving dish!) but be careful to support the shaped bread as much as you can.

Now, your eggs may come out a little spattered even though you were very careful not to splash the egg wash. Beats me, too! But the breads are so lovely anyway, no one notices.

Finishing notes on the bunnies: take your freezer marker (the one you label your leftover packages with) and draw eyes and two back-to-back fishhooks for a bunny nose/mouth. Here comes the obsession part: cut 1/4" or so wide strips of paper about 3" long (a 3 x 5" card works fine for this). Then cut the strips ALMOST all the way lengthwise into three very narrow strips. You've left an approximately square "tab" at one end, and especially if you used the cards, you've got curly whiskers. Take a glue stick and stick one set of whiskers beside each side of the "nose" and you've got BUNNIES! (Yeah, I know glue stick and permanent marker aren't edible, but they're on the egg SHELL for pete's sake. No one has sued me yet...)

Whether you take the elegant or the obsessive route, these lovelies will brighten your springtime celebrations!

NOTES : Well, it's time to send a recipe instead of just free advice.  I am making a
couple dozen of these tonight as our public schools level the playing field
by allowing NO celebrations of ANY "organized" religion ... so I am slipping
in a little Wicca (?) and celebrating the solstice instead.

Anyway, this is slightly adapted from a traditional Italian Easter bread, which I found in a mid-70's Farm Journal bread cookbook. If you have no traditional Italian family to argue with you, you may enjoy the Bunny option.

This is basically turbo-charged Challah wrapped around a dyed egg... makes a very lovely presentation in any of the assembly options.

Notes:
I'm using Canadian AP (Robin Hood, Bakery Standard) so check your dough and adjust
accordingly. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky.

I used olive oil, regular light, the kind with practically no taste. Canola should do fine.

Lecithin and Lemon Juice, not in the original recipe, are there because I add them to all my baking. I get a lighter product, higher rise, and better keeping qualities, and my finished product freezes well.

I have seen people when following this type recipe, add the egg to the liquid and beat, then add the slurry to the container. I have done this as well and can tell you that for whatever reason, the end product does not measure up. Add your liquids, break the egg into the container, and let the ABM do the blending, you will get a lighter better result.

Where I call for 'oleo', butter can of course be substituted. Also while this recipe is 'halved' from the original, I found it made more caramel then I needed. I was going to cut it still further, but enjoyed the leftovers on my ice cream so much (and still have some left in a jar) that I left it as is. Another thing, I used a flat (1/2 inch or so rims) pan for this recipe and because
I tipped it slightly when placing it into the oven, I have a well caramelised oven floor. I'd advise pans with an inch, inch and a half rim instead, and so I will do, next time.
Also, the original recipe called for the caramel to be made 'stovetop' and so you can make it. I use the microwave because it cuts the constant stirring, danger of burning, It's just faster and easier.

As to the filling, I confess I never measure when making them. Just do as you do or refer to the original if you need guidance. The original called for Currents by the way, I prefer the succulence of raisins, currents I save for scones.

Now what you've been waiting for ... These buns are delicious ... positively great!
In spite of all the stuff I've written (just trying to be clear), they are fast and simple to make. They are what we up here would call a 'Chelsea Bun' although to some a CB would contain candied fruit, which you could certainly add by the way.
---

Dough:
Place in container in the order best for your ABM Run on Dough setting.
Allow to rise until well doubled (about 3/4 hr) .

Caramel:
Place in container and microwave med high (70%) until oleo is melted, stirring occasionally. Spray (Pam) baking pans and pour in caramel, tipping to spread evenly over surface.

Filling:
Roll dough out on lightly floured surface making a rectangle approx 15" wide by 11" tall.
Spread oleo or brush with melted butter, leaving a 1 inch border at top. Sprinkle with cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, and pecans. Roll up from the bottom, pinching the dough to seal well. Cut into 12 pieces a little over an inch wide and place in the pan fairly close together.
Cover loosely and allow to rise in a warm oven for about 45 minutes to one hour.

Bake at 350* or until they are golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool five minutes, then invert onto another pan or sheet. Let cool for 20 minutes, then pull apart. Serve warm.

NOTES : I was also impressed with thie Caramel Buns, and decided to adapt it to my ABM and simplify it where possible.
The results were impressive so I am sending it on for you and others who want to try. My only problem was guarding them against thieves, they disappeared fast ... I now have a back up bag in the freezer so can have my big warm bun with tea when the mood strikes.

  2               cups  Packed Brown Sugar
     1/2          cups  Light Corn Syrup
     1/4          cups  Water
                        Cinnamon Filling:
  6               Tbsp  Butter -- Melted
                        (3/4 Stick)
  1 1/2           cups  Packed Light Brown Sugar -- Or
                        Dark Brown Sugar
     1/4          cups  Ground Cinnamon
  1               cups  Chopped Pecans
  1               cups  Dried Currants

Place the yeast in a 1 cup measuring bowl with 1/2 cup warm water sprinkle the yeast and add a pinch of sugar. Let stand at room temperature until foamy about 10 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining water, remaining sugar, egg, vanilla, oil, dry milk powder, salt and 2 cups of the flour. Beat about 1 minute. Stir in the yeast mixture and add the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time. Knead by hand or mixer for about 4 to 7 minutes until smooth and elastic.

Let rise in a draft free place until doubled.

Make the caramel: In a small skillet or heavy saucepan, melt the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and water over low heat stirring constantly. When melted remove from heat. Pour into baking pans or skillets that have been coated with Pam. Spread evenly over the surface.Turn onto a floured surface and knead a couple of times. In a small bowl combine the sugar and cinnamon. set aside.

Turn the dough out onto a greased surface and divide into 2 portions. Roll into a 12 x 15 inch rectangle. Leaving a 1 inch border around the edges brush with the melted butter and sprinkle with the cinnamon and sugar dividing each between each of the 2 rectangles. Then sprinkle both with pecans and brown sugar. Roll up jelly-roll fashion, starting at the long edge. Cut into 12 equal portions each 1 to 1/2 inch thick. Place close together in pans cut side down. Cover loosely and let rise at room temperature about 45 minutes or until puffy and even with the rims of the pan.

Bake at 350F until the rolls are light golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool at least 5 minutes, then invert onto a platter or baking sheet. Let cool for 20 minutes then pull apart to serve warm.

The rolls can be refrigerated or frozen before the last rise. Cover the pans loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours. Remove pans to room temperature and let rest 30 minutes while preheating the oven. If freezing use a disposable aluminum pan to avoid freezer burn or breakage. To thaw and bake frozen rolls, let stand uncovered at room temperature until doubled in bulk about 6 hours.

  1                cup  rye flour
                        ---

  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast

  1                     egg -- whisked with
  2        tablespoons  milk

* I use raw goats milk because I leave the rye sour out on the counter overnight to develop a slight sour taste. Pasteurized milk will spoil but not truly sour as raw will do. If you want a very sour taste then leave the rye sour out on the counter for a couple of days.

To make the rye sour combine the milk with the rye flour and mix very well. Cover and leave out on the counter as long as you desire. See explanation above. I have skipped a waiting period here and combined the milk sour with the rye sponge ingredients at the same time with satisfactory results.

To make the rye sponge proof the yeast in the warm water. When it is thoroughly dissolved pour it and the milk sour into a large bowl. Mix in the flour and stir well. Let the sponge sit, covered with a damp cloth, at room temp. for 3 1/2 to 4 hours- until it has risen well and dropped.

To make the dough- dissolve the molasses or honey in the warm water in a separate container. Stir down the rye sponge and sprinkle the salt over it. Add the sweetener and caraway and mix until well combined. Now start adding the flour until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and is no longer sticky. Transfer the dough to the work table and knead for about ten minutes, adding flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface. Cover the dough with a damp cloth to prevent drying and let it rise for 50-60 minutes. Punch the dough down and divide into two loaves or, if you want a very large loaf, leave it in one piece. Let dough sit on the worktable, covered, for ten minutes. This step will relax the dough and make it more pliable for forming. To form the loaves flatten the dough with a rolling pin then fold it over itself away from you. Square the edges by pushing the ends an inch or so toward the middle. Then roll into a tight log, sealing at each turn with the heel of your hand. Square the ends off and place each loaf, seam side down, on rimless baking sheet which has been lightly oiled and sprinkled with polenta (coarse cornmeal). Pre-heat oven to 415F.

Let loaves proof for 30-40 minutes. When the dough fails to spring back quickly when touched lightly with the fingertip it is ready. To attain a nice oven spring it is better to bake it a few minutes early than late. When loaves are ready brush the glaze on the tops and sides of each loaf and then slash 6-7 times across with a razor blade, starting from half way up one side and ending half way down the other. Sprinkle the top lightly with polenta.

Prior to placing the loaves in the oven spray water into the oven with a spray bottle, avoiding the oven light which may shatter. Bake the loaves for about 35 minutes, spraying the oven again after the first 5 minutes and again after ten minutes. This will give the loaves a crisp crust. Unless your oven has evenly distributed heat you may want to turn the baking sheet around half way through the baking to assure even browning. The loaves are done when they sound hollow when thumped on the bottom or when they have an internal temperature of 190F or above.

                      Caring For A Sourdough Starter

Recipe By     :Bill Proctor <bproctor@accessone.com>
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips
                Starter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

Bear in mind, my method of taking care of sourdough comes from 30 or so years experience and not from a technical standpoint.

I ruined my long standing culture a few years ago and bought a Yukon culture from "Sourdoughs International". I've been very happy with the culture. However, neither the information that comes with the culture or Ed Wood's book gives any information on how to take care of it. Here are my recommendations;

1) Store the culture in a glass, ceramic or pottery container (make sure the pottery container has no lead in it)

2) The culture should be stored in a refrigerator with a slightly loose top to allow the fermentation process to continue as it will slowly, even in a refrigerator

3) Never allow metal spoons or containers to come in contact with the starter. It may take on a distinctive metallic taste.

4) Every 2-3 weeks (of non-usage), take the starter out of the refrigerator. Stir it well to allow the brown liquid on the surface to be mixed in well. Allow it to come to room temperature, throw out half of it and add flour and water at a ratio of 1cup water to 1 1/2 cups of flour. Don't try to stir out any lumps as they will be dissolved as the starter works. Allow the mixture to sit for a day or so until it is good and bubbly. If the container is too full, throw out some again. Add about half of the flour and water that you did at first and stir it in good. Return to the refrigerator for another storage period.

5) Never add any other ingredients to the starter. They only serve to contaminate it and may ruin the native starter.

6) When you want to use the starter, take it out of the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature. Stir it well and add some flour and water in the ratio I explained above. Be sure it comes to a nice bubbly texture before you remove some to start your project.

7) Before returning to the refrigerator, add flour and water as I explained before to give it some food during the next stay in the refrigerator.

Sourdough starter is living organism and needs food periodically. As it works, the are a lot of dead cells and throwing out half the starter and adding new flour gets the organisms going again. As I mentioned last week, if your starter has been idle for several weeks, it may take several feedings to really rejuvenate it.

     1/3           cup  warm water
  1                pkg  yeast
                        -- or 1 Tablespoon dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        ---
  4 1/2           cups  bread flour ( -- or 20 ounces)
  3        Tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt

                        ---
                        GLAZE:
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  water
                        sesame seeds

Stir together the sugar, yeast and water. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to proof.

Fit dough blade into processor workbowl. Add flour, salt and remaining sugar. Pulse to combine. Break eggs into 2-cup measure, then add cold water to the 1 cup line. Add the oil. Stir to break up the eggs.

Turn machine on and pour the yeast mixture in first, then continue running the machine as you pour in the water-egg-oil mixture in a steady stream. Mix until dough forms a ball and cleans the side of the bowl. Challah dough should be quite soft--almost clinging to the sides of the bowl, but not really sticking. (If it is sticking, add flour as machine runs, by the tablespoons until the ball will revolve.) Continue processing for 60 seconds to knead dough.

Remove dough to an oiled bowl or a 1-gallon zip type bag. Close the dough in. Let rise in warm place until doubled. (Time varies from 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.)

Spray an area of your counter top. Empty dough out gently and form into a long narrow shape about 15-18 inches long. (Don't purposely try to deflate the dough--it will be more compliant if you just work with it. It will naturally deflate as you do.) Place the dough on an oiled baking sheet. With knife or scissors, cut dough into 3 long pieces for braiding. Start braiding in the middle and go to the one end, being careful not to stretch the dough, then go back to middle and braid to the other end. Pinch the 3 ends together at both ends of the loaf and tuck under any stray pieces.

Cover loaf loosely with oiled plastic wrap and set aside to rise until doubled.

Preheat oven to 375F before dough has fully doubled.

Whisk glaze together and brush on loaf. Sprinkle with seeds. Bake in lower third of oven for 20 minutes, then lower temperature to 350F and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until loaf is golden. Cool on rack.

Biga:
Let sit covered - in or out of the refrigerator.  I think that leaving it
out gives it a bit of a flavor).  Next day, add some more water and flour,
and do this once again the following day.  You have a yeast that is raring
to go at that point.

Put kneaded dough in oiled bowl.  I cover that with a damp towel and saran
wrap.  Let it rise until it is doubled (a 1/2 inch finger imprint in the
dough remains at this point).  When it is doubled, knead it for another
minute or two and divide into three portions.  I have gotten lazy when it
comes to braiding challah, so I have simply put it in bread pans - or take
my dough, cut it in thirds and then place those three pieces into the bread
pan.  Cover, and let rise until doubled - again with the finger imprint
test.  When it is risen, paint the top with an egg wash ( 1 egg + 2 tbsp
water - mixed)  and then you can sprinkle the top with poppy or sesame
seeds - or simply leave as it is.

Have a preheated oven 400 degrees.  Put the bread in on a rack and after 10
minutes turn the heat down to 375.  I let this go for another 20 minutes,
remove from the pan, and remove the loaf from the pan,  giving another coat
of the egg wash - and put this loaf on my stone which has been in the oven
the whole time and is well heated.  Don't put the pans directly on the
stone initially or they will prevent the stone  from getting as hot as it
should. After the loaves are recoated and placed on the stone, give them
another 10-12 minutes.  They are done when the loaf sounds hollow as you
tap the bottom of it.  If you don't have a stone, just leave the loaf in
the pan. I use PAM or my own type PAM (lecithin liquid 1/2 cup and olive
oil 1 cup in a jar)  on the inside of the pan before putting the dough
in.  Then the loaf pops out very nicely.  Let cool on a rack.

For fancier challah you can add some vanilla, more honey or sugar, raisins
that have been plumped.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2          cups  milk
     1/2          cups  hot water
  1               tbsp  butter or bacon fat or any shortening
  1               tbsp  sugar
  3               cups  flour
  1 1/4            tsp  salt
     3/4          cups  grated cheese -- (3/4 to 1 1/2)
  1 1/2            tsp  yeast

* (pre-grated supermarket cheddar works great, but if you want something celestial, try a hard smoked cheese, such as provolone or cheddar)

Put all ingredients in a bread machine, and put through the regular cycle
(light crust if you have the option).

When I make it outside the machine, I double it to make two loaves.  Make it
like any standard dough through the first rising; punch down, shape and
place in two greased loaf pans.  Let rise again.  Bake at 425F for 15 mins;
then at 375 for about 30 mins more until done.  Cool out of pans on a wire
rack.

NOTES : I have been meaning to post this recipe for a while, as it is one of my all time favorite bread recipes. Nothing fancy, but great bread and virtually foolproof. Our kids go wild over it; they especially love it toasted. I have made it by hand, in a KitchenAid, and in my ZO ABM; it works great in all of them. What follows is the ABM version, together with minimal directions for making it outside the machine. If anyone wants more explicit non-machine directions, email me.

                             Cheese Scones #2

Recipe By     :Scottish Cookery,  Catherine Brown Glenfiddich
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Cheese & Meat Breads
                Hand Made                       Scones


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3          cups  Flour -- Unbleached
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  2                Tsp  Cream Of Tartar
                        Salt -- To Taste
  4               Tbsp  Butter -- (1/2 Stick)
     3/4           cup  Milk
  1                cup  grated cheese

Cheese Scones -- Add 1 generous cup of grated cheese to the basic dough
before rolling it out.  Cheddar is a particularly good choice, as is
parmesan.  The author likes to serve them with vegetable soup.

Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

Filling: Unwrap and cut chocolate-peanut butter cups in half. Taking 1 piece of dough, wrap around a peanut butter cup half. Pinch together, forming ball that covers cup. Repeat with remaining dough and cup halves. Place balls, smooth side down, in bottom of greased 6 cup Bundt pan or 9-inch round layer-cake pan. Continue lining pan with balls of dough until all pieces are used up and the pan is full.

Place pan in COLD oven. Turn oven to 375F. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until top is golden and puffed. Immediately remove bread from pan to wire rack to cool.

Glaze: Meanwhile, melt 8 mini peanut butter cups in small saucepan over very low heat. Stir in milk until smooth. Drizzle over the bread. To serve, either cut into slices or pull the pieces apart.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  Lora Brody's Sourdough Bread Enhancer

* plus additional water if necessary to make a very wet dough

Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for dough or manual and press start. Check the dough during the first few minutes of the knead cycle adding more water if necessary to form a very wet, slack batter-like dough that barely forms a ball and does not clean the sides of the pan. Line a large baking sheet with parchment.

Pour and scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and use a dough scraper to divide it into 3 portions. Flour your hands and lift the dough onto the parchment, forming a rough, flat oval shape. Leave at least 2 1/2" between the loaves. Drizzle the tops with olive oil and allow to rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450F. with the rack in the upper, but not highest position. Just before baking, use your fingertips to poke the top of the ciabatta to deflate it. Bake until the tops are dry and just barely golden brown.

Cool on racks for at least 15 minutes before serving.

NOTES : Here's a recipe for a dough that if love to make in the bread machine, then  bake in the oven.  The dough is exceptionally wet - almost like a batter.

This means "slipper" in Italian.  If you love bread that will exercise your  mouth, then this chewy loaf is for you!

                        drained
                        ---
  2              tbsp.  bread or all-purpose flour

Makes:  2 loaves

Sponge:

Blend ingredients together thoroughly in medium bowl.  Cover; place in
refrigerator for 12-24 hours.

Bread:
Preheat oven to 425F (400F if using convection).

In a large mixing bowl, combine all bread ingredients (sponge through ripe olives) and knead for 7-9 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into two equal portions (you may also make 4 individual-sized bread loaves). The dough will be sticky and soft, so you may wish to flour your hands before working with the dough.

Roll each portion into a roughly oval shape approximately 3/4" thick. These breads are more beautiful if they are shaped irregularly. Dust loaves lightly with flour. Place loaves on a baking sheet sprinkled lightly with cornmeal. Let rise for 20-30 minutes until doubled in thickness and puffy.

Bake for 25-27 minutes until loaves are slightly browned on top and sound hollow when tapped. Remove from oven; cool on wire rack.

NOTE: these loaves are excellent when used for sandwiches or "quick" pizzas.

For sandwiches: slice loaf in half horizontally; toast lightly. Top one half with sandwich filling, place other half on top. Serve.

For quick pizzas: brush very lightly with olive oil and other pizza toppings (cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni, chopped fresh vegetables, herbs) and place under broiler until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve immediately.

     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  melted butter

I have been making cinnamon rolls for several years. My family loves them.
The recipe I use calls for 1/2 cup of sugar, 2 tsp. of cinnamon, and 2
tablespoons of melted butter.  I usually double this for a softer, gushier
inside.

                        *****

A few more points to ponder in the continuing saga of cinnamon rolls:

The addition of mashed potato to the sweet dough adds moistness, a light texture, and considerably improves the softness and the keeping qualities of the rolls.

Including the raisins in the dough rather than placing them on top of the rolled-out dough, makes for softer raisins that are better incorporated in the roll, less likely to fall out or to dry out/burn in the oven.

Slice the rolls with dental floss, as others have mentioned, to help maintain the shape of the roll. [Carolyn Dandalides Frank.Yuhasz@pentairpump.com]

Perhaps some of you remember a chain of cinnamon roll places called T.J. Cinnamon's in malls back in the 1980's. One day when my daughters were kids, they were watching one of the bakers working in their front window and talking to him. When he put the filling on the dough, one of my daughters commented about some little candy bits in the filling. He told her it was peppermint! Evidently just a touch of crushed peppermint candy, like candy canes, was a "company secret" in their cinnamon rolls. You might like to try it sometime. Their rolls were very good. [Kejah@aol.com]

For a great cinnamon roll, you can order from King Arthur - Baker's Cinnamon Filling.
This is a mixture which you really cannot duplicate in the kitchen and it produces a perfect product. You can also make other things with it, like coffeecake Pour 3/4 of the batter in the pan, sprinkle on a thin layer of the filling, pour in the remainder of the batter and sprinkle a bit more on top. Yummy.. [Andie Paysinger <asenji@earthlink.net>]

I am happy to say you won't have to get up at the crack of dawn to enjoy your cinnamon buns. After you shape the buns and place them in the bread pan,you can cover with foil and refrigerate overnight. (or you can freeze them). Before baking, allow to come to room temperature, and as Erin suggested, let them rise again. (for at least 30 minutes). Then bake as directed. Well, it's not the crack of dawn but you will have to leave some time. [Loiscon1@aol.com]

My mother was a great baker - all her baking was mouthwatering. One comment - advice that I clearly remember from her was that you cut the cinnamon rolls once rolled with - string or butcher cord - never with a knife. You do this to keep the filling i. e. sugar, butter, nuts raisins etc. in the roll and not in the bottom of the pan. Then you put them in the pan to bake. Hope that this will help.

  1         tablespoon  yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted

                        brown sugar
                        cinnamon

Dissolve yeast in water. Mix egg, cottage cheese and butter, add to yeast. Stir in flour and sugar to make a dough, knead, let rise. Punch down, roll out into a rectangle. For filling, I brush the dough with 1 tsp vanilla in 1 T. water, sprinkle a layer of brown sugar over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon over that. Roll up, let rise, bake at 375F for 17 - 20 minutes. I usually cover the pan with a clean towel for a few minutes after baking, it seems to help keep the rolls soft.

This is the second revised edition.

Small loaf:
1/4 C milk
1/4 C water
1 egg
1 tsp salt
3 Tbsp butter or margarine
1/4 C sugar
2 C all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
Glaze:
3 Tbsp melted butter or margarine
1/3 C brown sugar
Filling:
1 Tbsp melted butter or margarine
1 Tbsp granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 Tbsp brown sugar
1/3 C raisins, optional

Place dough ingredients in bread pan, select Dough setting, and press Start.

When the dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep.  Turn off
bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out dough onto a lightly floured
countertop or cutting board.

For the Small Recipe:
Pour the melted butter for the glaze into one 9" round or square cake pan;
sprinkle with brown sugar.  With a rolling pin, roll dough into an 8x14"
rectangle.

For the Medium Recipe:
Pour the melted butter for the glaze into one 9x13x2" pan or two 8 or 9"
round or square cake pans; sprinkle with brown sugar.  With a rolling pin,
roll dough into a 9x18" rectangle.

For the Large Recipe:
Pour the melted butter for the glaze into two 9" round or square cake pans;
sprinkle with brown sugar.  Divide dough in half.  With a rolling pin, roll
each ball of dough into an 8x14" rectangle.

For the filling:
Brush the melted butter on the dough.  In a small bowl, combine the
granulated sugar, cinnamon, brown sugar, and raisins; sprinkle over
dough.  Starting with long edge, roll up dough; pinch seams to seal.  With
a knife, lightly mark roll into 1 1/2" sections. Slide a 12" piece of
dental floss or heavy thread underneath.  By bringing the ends of the floss
up and crisscrossing them at the top of each mark, you can cut through the
roll by pulling the strings in opposite directions.  Place rolls cut side
up in prepared pan(s), flattening them slightly.* Cover and let rise in a
warm oven 30 - 45 min until doubled.  (Hint: To warm oven slightly, turn
oven on Warm setting for 1 min, then turn it off, and place covered dough
in oven to rise.  Remove pan(s) from oven to preheat.)

Preheat oven to 350F. Bake for 25 - 30 min until golden brown.  Remove from
oven and immediately invert rolls onto a large platter or serving
dish.  Serve warm.

*The rolls can be covered with foil at this point and refrigerated
overnight or frozen for 1 month.  Before baking, allow rolls to thaw
completely and rise in a warm oven for at least 30 minutes.

Small recipe yields 9 rolls
Medium recipe yields 12 rolls
Large recipe yields 18 rolls

                        DOUGH:
     1/2           cup  warm water (105- to 110F)
  2               pkgs  active dry yeast (2 scant TBS)
  2               tbsp  granulated sugar
  1                pkg  instant vanilla pudding (the key) -- (3-1/2-oz.)

  2                     eggs -- beaten

  3               cups  powdered sugar

(Makes 20 very large rolls)

DOUGH:

In small bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar. Stir until dissolved. Set aside.

In large bowl, make pudding mix according to package directions. Add
butter, eggs and salt; mix well. Add the  yeast mixture; blend. Gradually
add flour and knead until  smooth, adding "sprinkles" of flour toward the
end, until the dough is soft and silky feeling, but no longer sticky (soft
as a baby's behind).

Place in very large greased bowl. Cover and let rise until  double in bulk
(about 1 hour).

Punch down and let rise again (about 45 minutes).

On a lightly floured surface, roll out to a 34" x 21" rectangle. Spread 1
cup of melted butter over surface.

TOPPING:

In small bowl, mix brown sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle all over top
of surface, sprinkle raisins over  the top. Roll up tightly

With a knife, put a notch every 2 inches. With string or thread, place
under roll by notch and criss-cross over to cut roll (makes a nice clean cut).

Place on greased baking pan, 2-inches apart. Lightly press rolls down with
your hands (just a LITTLE, it helps to hold  them together better). Use 8-
or 9-inch square (or round) pans-- DO NOT put more than 4 rolls in each
pan; if you do, the ones in the middle won't get good and done. The first
time I made them, I used a 13x9 inch pan, putting about 6 in each-- the
ones in the middle didn't get done, turned out doughy.

Cover and let rise until double again.

Bake at 350F for 15 to 20 minutes. Take them out when they JUST start to
turn golden. DON'T OVER BAKE!  Frost warm rolls with Cream Cheese Frosting.

CREAM CHEESE FROSTING:

Combine all ingredients and mix until smooth. Spread on very warm rolls. Rolls are best when served warm.

NOTES : Here's a recipe that I've used for years that I got on a food newsgroup. It
makes really huge cinnamon rolls with a really nice filling.

Hi Mark, having never tasted "Cinnbon's" rolls, I'm not sure if these are
the same. The woman who posted the recipe (on Prodigy), says they taste
exactly the same. I have made them and they're DEEEELICIOUS! Hope you have
lots of room to roll out the dough. The rolls are HUGE.

NOTES : I've been baking these for years - the recipe came from the University of British Columbia food services who kindly cut the proportions down to a manageable 18 rolls ... I've cut it in half again because really good cinnamon rolls are best fresh out of the oven (but they can be heated gently in the microwave the next day) ...

Icing is not only unnecessary but would ruin them. Don't substitute for any ingredients...

  2          teaspoons  yeast
                        --
                        Filling for Large Loaf:
  6        tablespoons  melted butter
  1 1/3    tablespoons  cinnamon
  5        tablespoons  brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  chopped walnuts
                        --
                        Glaze for Large Loaf:
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  3          teaspoons  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla


Place ingredients in your breadmaker according to manufacturer's suggestions. Set machine to dough cycle (manual) and start.

Preheat oven to 350F.

FILLING: Mix filling ingredients together. Remove dough from machine and roll into a rectangle. Spread filling evenly on top. Roll in a jelly-roll fashion starting at the wide end. Pinch seams closed. Place on greased baking sheet, cover and let rise about 30-45 minutes (if not otherwise specified). Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and bread makes a hollow sound when tapped.

GLAZE: Mix glaze ingredients until desired consistency -- fairly thick. Pour over baked bread while still hot.

NOTES : I forgot to let the dough rise after rolling into a jelly-roll, but it turned out great anyway.

Also, we added more milk to the glaze as it was rather dry. Came out perfect.

I made the medium loaf but, because it was so good, I will make the large one next time.

I've made this with AND without raisins. Patrick prefers it WITH, and I prefer it WITHOUT.

For Anne who was asking about clay cookers. I have two, one I use for roasting chickens and one that I use to bake bread. I do not have a problem with bread sticking in it because I lightly spray the bottom half with Pam and then sprinkle in a little corn meal. I then put in the shaped dough that has gone through the bread machine. I cover it and let it rise for an hour. I then take off the lid and soak it in warm water for 15 mins. Meanwhile the oven has been preheating at 425 for 30 mins. While the lid is soaking, I lightly cover the dough with a towel. I put the cover back on and it goes into the oven. It bakes for 20 mins covered, and 20 mins uncovered. The bread has a wonderful, crispy crust.

For the chicken, I lightly spray the bottom with Pam, then I take a whole bag of French-cut green beans (frozen) and put them on the bottom. I put the whole chicken on top and bake it between 45 mins and an hour, depending on the size of the chicken.

     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  honey
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1            package  dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  4               cups  white flour
  2               cups  whole-wheat flour -- approximately
     1/2           cup  finely chopped candied orange peel
  1                cup  pecans -- in coarse pieces

Bring 1/2 cup water to a boil; mix it with the milk, honey, and salt in a
large bowl and let cool to lukewarm. In a separate container, stir the yeast
into 1/2 cup warm water and let it stand for 5 minutes to dissolve. Add the
dissolved yeast and 3 cups of the white flour to the first mixture and beat
vigorously. Add the remaining cup of white flour and 1 cup of the whole-wheat
flour and mix well. Turn it out onto a lightly floured board; knead for a
minute or two, and let rest for 10 minutes. Using the remaining flour only if
the dough is too sticky to handle, resume kneading until smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a greased bowl; cover, and let rise in a warm place until
double in bulk. Punch down and knead in the candied orange peel and the
pecans. Shape into 2 loaves; place in greased loaf pans; cover and let rise
until almost double in bulk. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake bread for 45 - 55
minutes. Remove from pans and cool on racks.

I also use a 2 pound Zo and change recipes this way:
increase the flour to 4 cups
increase the yeast to 1 tablespoon
increase the sweetener by 1/3
increase the salt to 2 teaspoons
increase the fat by 1/3
Any other ingredients increase by 1/3
increase the water to approximately 12 ounces - it is essential to check the
dough during the first knead cycle, adding additional water of flour as
necessary to create a soft, supple ball

I noticed someone mentioned receiving MORE BREAD MACHINE MAGIC for Christmas in a recent digest. For those who have the first printing of this book, I'd like to post the typos so you can make corrections to your copy and avoid any duds:

Page 25 -- Med. Semolina should be 1 1/4 - 1 3/8 cups water
Page 30 -- Small Bauernbrot should be 3/4 cup water
Page 31 -- Bev's Killer Rye
	Small - Add 1 tablespoons caraway seeds
	Med - Add 1 1/2 tablespoons caraway seeds
	Large - Add 2 tablespoons caraway seeds, should be 1 1/2 to 1 5/8 cups
water, should be 4 tablespoons grated orange rind
Page 61 -- Med. Sourdough Rye should be 2 1/3 cups bread flour
Page 99 -- Med. Linda C's Sun Dried Tomato bread should be 1 1/4 - 1 3/8
cups water
Page 174 -- Large Basic Pizza Dough should be 4 tsp sugar

I personally apologize for these errors.  There was a last-minute change of layout and things got a bit scrambled.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3          cups  Flour -- Unbleached
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  2                Tsp  Cream Of Tartar
                        Salt -- To Taste
  4               Tbsp  Butter -- (1/2 Stick)
     3/4           cup  heavy cream -- or sour cream
  2                     eggs

Cream Scones -- Substitute 3/4 Cup fresh heavy cream or sour cream for the
milk in the basic recipe.  Add 2 eggs to the dough at the same time as the
cream.  This rich scone tastes quite different from the basic recipe, and
can be used as a base for individual strawberry shortcakes.

Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

NOTES : I have a wonderful scone recipe that came from a book titled "From Celtic
Hearths" by Deborah Krasner.  It was a Christmas gift about 10 years ago
and I have used it OVER and OVER again.  The author credits the recipe
to  "Scottish Cookery" by Catherine Brown Glenfiddich.  The recipe below is
for Sweet Milk Scones which I basically use as a starting point and then
add whatever we are in the mood for. Most often we eat Parsley and Onion

Combine cream with buttermilk or starter. Put into a clean, warmed thermos or glass jar. Cover tightly and keep in a warm place for 6 to 8 hours. If using creme fraiche starter, keep covered for 24 hours. When mixture has jelled andis almost firm, refrigerate. It will solidify further in the fridge. Will keep for a month if made with the Solait and for 10 days with the buttermilk.

Set it out at around 75F for 6 to 8 hours or overnight, until the cream has thickened. Stir up, cover and refrigerate. When supply is almost exhausted, simply blend in more heavy cream and repeat the process.

  1                cup  heavy cream (whipping cream)
  1                cup  sour cream (full fat)

Combine the creams in a ceramic mixing bowl and whisk lightly together.

Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place (at warm
room temperature is sufficient) (72-75?) overnight for the culture to
develop.  (In cold weather, this may take up to 24 hours). At the end of
the maturing time, the cream mixture will be thick and subtly tart.

Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours.

Creme fraiche will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks and will
continue to develop its delicate tartness as it matures.

Even though this recipe is from a French cookbook the ingredients you will be using are of American origin. I'll bet you anything in the world that the French style of creme fraiche is made from the cream of Guernsey or Jersey cows or the French equivalent. These cows produce a very rich milk, high in butterfat. Although there may be exceptions in the US, most commercial milk is produced from Holsteins. These cows give volumes of milk per cow, but the butterfat is much lower.

You might be able to find a richer type of cream sold at some health food stores or coops. If you're really lucky, perhaps you might find a dairy farmer in your rural area that raises a Guernsey or Jersey cow who would be willing to sell you some of his milk. I know, that's a long shot, but it's worth exploring. As you probably know milk purchased from a dairy or small farm is raw. If you trust the farmer to have healthy cows, you're okey, but many consider this a risk not worth taking.

For what it's worth, my parents used to have a farm and we would purchase milk by the gallon from our neighbors who sold the milk from their cows to the local dairies. We'd always ask for the milk from their few Guernseys and it made wonderful butter, buttermilk and ice cream. It seemed we get almost 1/2 butterfat to a gallon of milk. No one ever got sick, either.

Oh, one more caveat to raw milk. In early spring cows allowed to fend for themselves in the pastures will eat the wild garlic that comes up in March-April. The milk can take on the taste of the garlic and it's not exactly tasty, even for garlic lovers.

NOTES : Do NOT use an ulta-pasteurized heavy whipping cream. That does not work well at all. A pasteurized heavy whipping cream is fine, but not the ulta-pasteurized heavy cream. You may have to do some hunting to find a heavy whipping cream that is not ulta-pasteurized. [Lynn E Cragholm <lest2@juno.com>]

  2               cups  White Cake Flour -- Or
                        -- whole-wheat pastry flour
  1               Tbsp  sugar

     1/4           Tsp  salt
  1 1/2           cups  creme fraiche

1. Preheat the oven to 425F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the creme fraiche with a fork or a heavy-duty electric mixer until the mixture resembles a sticky, yet cohesive dough.

2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until the dough holds together, about 6 times. Divide the dough into two equal parts and pat each into a 1" thick round about 6" in diameter. With a knife, cut each round into quarters. Cut out the scones with a 2" biscuit cutter to make 12-14 scones.

3. Place the scones about 1" apart on a greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crusty and golden brown, 15-18 minutes. Serve immediately.

  1               cups  Water
  2 3/4           cups  Bread Flour
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  1                Tsp  Salt
  1 1/2            Tsp  Quick Active Dry Yeast -- Or
                        Bread Machine Yeast
  1                     Egg Yolk
  1               Tbsp  Water

Measure carefully, placing all ingredients except egg yolk and 1 Tbsp water
in bread machine pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer.

Select Dough/Manual cycle.  Do not use delay cycles.

Remove dough from pan, using lightly floured hands.  Cover and let rest 10
min on lightly floured surface.

Grease outsides of six 10 oz custard cups.  Place cups upside down on
ungreased cookie sheet.  Divide dough into 6 equal pieces.  Roll or pat
each piece into 7" circle on lightly floured surface.  Shape dough circles
over outsides of cups.  Cover and let rise in warm place 15 - 20 min or
until slightly puffy.

Heat oven to 375F.  Mix egg yolk and 1 Tbsp water; brush gently overread
bowls.  Bake 18 - 22 min or until golden brown.  Carefully lift bread bowls
from custard cups - bread and cups will be hot.  Cool bread upright on wine
rack.

Success Tip: When placing the dough circle over the cup, don't let the
dough curl under the edge of the cup.  It will bake onto the edge of the
cup and be difficult to remove.  If some of the dough should bake onto the
edge, use the point of a paring knife to carefully separate it from the cup.

Try This:
These bread bowls are not only fun to use but are also great to eat.  Fill
the bowl with a crisp green salad and serve as a side dish.  Or fill it
with a thick, chunky stew or your favorite main-dish salad.

Note 1: (email blanche007@aol.com for a free sample)
Note 2: or extra to make a soft, smooth ball of dough after the first 5-7
minutes  of kneading

Place all the ingredients except the egg white and seeds in the bread
machine and program for DOUGH using the Whole Wheat Setting if
available.   Watch the dough forming during the first few minutes of the
kneading cycle, adding additional water or white flour as needed to form a
smooth, moist, supple ball.   At the end of the final cycle,  remove the
dough to a lightly floured work surface.

To complete:
Sprinkle a heavy duty baking sheet with cornmeal.  Form the dough into a
low, round loaf, cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise in a warm place
until doubled in bulk.  Preheat the oven to 375F with the rack in the
center position.  Glaze with the egg wash and sprinkle with the seeds. Bake
for 30-45 minutes or until the bottom sounds hollow when tapped and the top
crust is quite firm, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 190F
on an instant read thermometer.

*  Make the altus 24 hours in advance: cover several slices of stale rye
bread with water.  Leave, covered,  at room temperature for 12 hours, then
drain off excess water and refrigerate.

Dough Tips:

1.Testing Dough Consistency
 2.Smooth, Satiny Ball
 3.Dough That Will Rise

Can't seem to find the right consistency? Is your dough not rising? How did your grandmother perfect that smooth, satiny ball that seems far away from your reach? Relax, you've come to the right section.


TIP #1 Testing Dough Consistency

Test by slapping your open hand against the ball of dough. If your hand comes away clean, the dough has enough flour. It should be smooth and satiny, not sticky.
The combination of flour and kneading should be sufficient to let the dough stand on its own.


TIP #2 Smooth, Satiny Ball

For a supple, more elastic consistency, carefully measure the wet and dry ingredients.
If dough appears too wet, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of flour at a time and knead to consistency.
If dough appears too dry, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid at a time and knead to consistency.

TIP #3 Dough That Will Rise

Substitute or decrease the amount of whole grain flours with finer grain flours to enhance the performance of the gluten. Allow dough to rise in a warm dry place, 75-85F/24-29C and away from drafts that can inhibit rising.

NOTES :
I adapted this recipe from a bakery recipes with 35 lbs of flour originally. The lemons and sour oranges were dry on the tree, there has not been rain lately, so I had to substitute ginger vinegar. Also I had no rice flour, so I used cornstarch in the topping.

Disclaimer: I have no idea why it is called "Dutch Bread". I would not risk again being lynch since the great 'portuguese bread" controversy.

Despite being a bread made with water, I supposed the topping made it soft. Next time, I will make the topping thicker, perhaps using 2 coats of the topping. The visual effect is beautiful, too. I think I got it from the Baking Master website.

Egg wash ... a double dose of egg wash (just an egg beaten to blend, but you can add a little milk or water if you find the plain egg too thick) makes a lovely, mahogany brown and shiny crust ... IF you put the first coat on right after shaping the bread, LET IT DRY, and then put the second coat on just before you pop the bread in the oven. If you don't let the first coat dry (which means letting the bread rise UNCOVERED), you just get a sloppy mess. Naturally, if you're sprinkling seeds or decorations on the top of the crust, you do it after the SECOND coat is brushed on.

                Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  1 1/2           cups  Warm Water
  4               Tbsp  Non-Instant Dried Milk
  2                Tsp  Salt
  3               cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- To 3 1/4 C

In a medium mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the
water.  Beat in the dried milk and salt.  Add 2 cups of the flour and beat,
either by hand or with an electric mixer, for several minutes.  Continue to
to beat in the remaining flour until the dough is like thick pancake batter
but more gummy and just beginning to leave the sides of the bowl.  Add a
little more flour if necessary to reach this consistency.

Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a cozy place for about 1 1/2
hours, or until doubled in bulk.  After this time, stir down the dough and
let it rest, covered, while you prepare to bake the muffins.  Thoroughly
grease the inside of your English muffin rings with shortening, butter or
nonstick cooking spray.  Heat a large heavy skillet until almost smoking,
then brush with shortening or oil, and set the rings inside ( it should
hold 4).  Alternately, heat an electric griddle to 350F.

Lower the heat slightly and transfer about 14 cup of dough to each
ring.  The easiest way to do this is to pick up a medium-sized gluey,
gloppy handful of it, slip it into the ring and then ease it out with your
fingers to fill the entire ring.  (It isn't pretty, but it works!) Cook the
muffins over medium heat 5 minutes, by which time the top surface should
have lost its moist look.  Now lift the rings off (they'll be hot!) and
turn each muffin over to cook on the other side 5 minutes.  Flip the
muffins a second time and cook for a further 5 minutes.

Repeat this procedure, greasing the rings again if necessary, to use
up the remaining dough.  Cool the muffins on racks, and store them in a
plastic bag until you are ready to toast them.  (Remember, split the
muffins apart first with your fingers or a fork; don't use a knife to cut
through them!)

Yield: 8 delicious muffins.

NOTES : Here is an english muffin recipe that my family and I love.  It came with
the english muffin rings I ordered from the King Arthur Cat. and says it is
"adapted from one found in Judith and Evan Jones' 'The Book of Bread'.   I
usually double it and mix it in the Kitchen Aid then bake the muffins on a
large electric griddle at 325F rather than the 350F the recipe calls for.
Although it calls for Non-instant dried milk, I have made it with instant
non-fat dried milk and with fresh or soured milk (reducing the water) and
those work fine, too.

For a little extra flavor in your cinnamon rolls, use raisins that have
been soaked in your favorite liquor.  I like Gallo's Livingston Cream
Sherry.  My sister uses rum or whiskey.

Lately I have added Craisins to many of my breads, rolls, and cookies in
place of raisins. They are a tasty change and are especially appropriate
around the Holiday season. Dick Carlton

  1 1/4           cups  whole-wheat flour
  1                cup  bread flour
  1                cup  warm water -- (100 to 110)
  1            package  dry yeast -- (about 2 1/4 teas.)
     1/2           cup  flax seeds
  2        tablespoons  flax seeds
  3        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
  2        tablespoons  All-Bran(r) Cereal -- shreds of wheat
                        bran cereal
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  bread flour
                        Cooking spray
  2          teaspoons  cornmeal
  1              large  egg white -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  flax seeds

Lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups, and level with a knife. Combine the bread flour, water, and yeast in a large bowl; stir well with a whisk. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

Place 1/2 cup flaxseed in a spice or coffee grinder, process until finely ground to measure 3/4 cup. Add the ground flaxseed, whole-wheat flour, 2 tablespoons whole flaxseed, and next 5 ingredients (2 tablespoons flaxseed though salt) to the yeast mixture, and stir until a soft dough forms (dough will feel tacky). Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining 3 tablespoons bread flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent the dough from sticking to hands. Shape dough into a 5-inch round loaf; place onto a baking sheet coated with cooking spray and sprinkled with cornmeal. Brush loaf with egg white; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon flaxseed. Make 3 diagonal cuts 1/4-inch-deep across top of loaf using a sharp knife. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85F) 1 hour or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers into dough. If the indentation remains, the dough has risen enough).

Preheat oven to 375.

Bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.

                       Flour: Bread Vs. All-Purpose

                        *****

It is all a matter of gluten, a protein
constituent of grains quite prevalent in wheat flour. The reason that bread is kneaded is to develop the gluten into a "net-like" substance that traps the gas (carbon dioxide) bubbles) made by the yeast. That's the rising side of gluten... but, it also has a tough side. The more the gluten is developed (which helps your loaf to rise) the "tougher" the finished product becomes (which makes hard crusts and chewier crumb). So, cakes us a flour that is lower in protein that makes the "gluten-net" when mixed and should not be over mixed to develop what "gluten-net" there is to work. That is why some pancake and waffle batters turn out tough results when over mixed. Of course, with breads, a strong "gluten-net" is needed to help their heavier doughs rise above the pull of earthly gravity. A "moon pie" would be much fluffier if baked in the moon's low gravitational pull.

The amount of protein or "gluten potential" in flour changes with every grain crop. Thus, most millers will blend their flours to achieve a target number. Of course, flours can be blended to achieve lower cost to the miller, and thus, contribute to sale price flour... often at a results penalty. For the truly committed artisan bread baker, grinding your own flour from whole grains of known quality creates far superior bread... even when higher quality commercial white flour is used. Whole grains contain the bran and the germ which release essential oils that are exquisite when fresh... and horrid when they turn rancid... which is why some people keep whole grain flour in the freezer. White flour has had the bran and germ removed in the milling process, leaving only the endosperm to rise above the rest.

Hard wheat makes the best bread flour... soft wheat makes the best cake flour... and all purpose flour takes a little of the best from both characteristics. As you use better quality flours, you will usually see better quality results... all things being equal (which is not always the case... and, thus, the adventure!). You certainly could do a lot worse than King Arthur Flour, and you can even do better in my experience. If you liked what King Arthur All Purpose Flour did, you will find that King Arthur Machine Bread Flour will rise above that when baking bread (in the oven or in the ABM) and not be as good for some of the baked goodies that you want to have a particularly soft and delicate nature. The critical difference is that the bread flour is one full percentage point higher in protein than their all-purpose flour. King Arthur also makes a Sir Lancelot High Gluten flour with a higher percentage of protein (14.0%) but that is more often used by commercial bakers with machines to do the heavier kneading required by the much stiffer dough. And, K.A. also makes Queen Guinevere Cake Flour which is bleached (yuck!) and very low in protein (probably less than 10%)... but light as a feather for commercial cake bakers. Better flours behave as expected and tend to have a finer texture in the finished product. If you do grind your own flour, you will find that the better wheat berry purveyors (such as Wild Oats or Whole Foods) will list the protein percentage and wheat type for you to achieve a much better than average artisan bread.

I prefer to use sourdough starters for a more healthy and wholesome home baking experience. Commercial yeast are selected for their ability to make a lot of gas in the shortest possible time and depend upon ingredients for good taste... and have only been around for a bit over a hundred years. Wild yeasts (with their symbiotic lactobacilli) make gas more slowly but have friendly bacteria that process the dough and make it tastier and more digestible by the account of most most bakers over the last 5,000 years of our human affection for leavened bread. It takes a bit longer... but, with good technique and a good knowledge of flour characteristics, it can be done with far less time and mess than most people home bakers know. Happy baking... -Sourdough Ed

  2               cups  Cooked Multi-Grain Mix -- See Below

      Beat to mix well, then knead till smooth and elastic. Dough should be
soft and sticky, but add more flour if needed. Spray bowl with baking
spray, put dough in bowl and spray top of dough.  Cover with plastic and
let rise till nearly double.  (about 45 min.)  Punch down and knead bubbles
out.  Cut into 16 pieces; roll each piece out very thin.  Place on sprayed
cookie sheet (you can cut into squares or leave in one piece).  Spray with
baking spray (I use Olive Oil flavored), then sprinkle with choice of
seasonings: salt, seasoned salt, seeds, etc. Bake at 345F for 18-20
minutes, till light brown.

Multigrain Mix
1 1/2 C oat groats
1  1/2 C long grain brown rice
1 C whole grain rye
1 1/2 C whole grain triticale
1 C whole grain buckwheat
1 C millet
1 C pearl barley
1 C sesame seed (optional)

1 C mix = 3 C cooked.

I make a whole batch of the mixed grain and cook it and freeze in 1 cup
portions.  I add one or two cups to my whole wheat bread dough.  (I live on
Molokai, Hawaii, and can't get triticale, so my mix doesn't include that)

These are both good, the main problem is that it takes much longer to make
them than to eat them up!

                 *****

Dear Susan and everyone else who emailed me about using the dough cycle and baking in the oven:

- First of all everyone is a novice sometime. The best thing about bread is that it's probably the most forgiving thing you can make. As I tell my classes, there's no absolute success or failure - the most important thing is that the bread tastes good (to you) - looks come second - after, all you can always serve it sliced!

Whether you are using the bread machine to make dough or using it to bake as well it is essential to check the dough during the beginning of the first knead cycle and to correct for liquid/flour as necessary to create a supple ball of dough. Flour is hydroscopic, so the amount of moisture in it at any given time varies - so you have to make up for that. There isn't a bread machine on earth that can do that for you. I'd venture to guess that any 'failed' loaves you've had are as a result of not checking the dough. The great thing about using the machine to make the dough and then baking it i n the oven it that you get to make a much wetter dough which makes a much more interesting, better tasting loaf of bread with a better texture. Bear in mind that wetter loaves won't rise a high as dry loaves because the dough can only sustain so much weigh/vs/height before it collapses, so I like to form low, round hand built loaves especially when making wet dough. Programming the machine for dough cycle will, in most cases gives you a knead cycle, a long rise cycle, another short knead cycle and a final rise (different machines have different versions of this, but ultimately the result is the same). After that final rise cycle the dough should be about twice the bulk of when you started. If not just leave the dough in the machine until it has risen.

At this point you have a few options: you can deflate the dough and form it into a loaf (by the way, if you do this right away don't start kneading the dough or it will become hard to shape because you've reactivated the gluten which is the protein in the flour -- think of it in terms of bubble gum - the more you chew the harder it gets). The other option is to stick the dough into a heavy duty gallon sized Ziplock baggie and refrigerate it for 12-24 hours. This long, slow cool rise further develops the texture, flavor and personality of the finished loaf. This step isn't essential, but if you have the time - it's a great thing to do. You also have the option of freezing the dough at this point. I use the same heavy duty baggie - make sure you mark the bag -all doughs look alike when frozen.

To form the bread you can use a loaf pan, or make a free form loaf. A dough made from three cups of flour makes a large loaf, so if you want to put it in a bread pan you're going to need one that is at least 12 cups - the bread may not fill come up to or over the rim, but you want that much room so the interior of the bread will bake through. You can also divide the dough and use 2 6-8 cup cans. Make sure to spray or grease the pans very well. Pat the dough into a flat oval, bring the long sides up to meet on top. Pinch together, then and tuck it into the pan, seam side down. If you want a free-form loaf, oil a heavy duty baking sheet and sprinkle it with a little corn meal. Pat the dough into a dome about 9" across and 3" high in the center with the sides sloping to about 2" high at the edges.

Cover the dough with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray and put it in a warm place to rise. A turned off gas oven is good for this, or place a 4 cup glass measuring cup full of hot water in the microwave. Microwave until the water boils. Carefully remove the hot water and put the bread pan in and close the door - you've created a proofing box - a warm, moist place for the dough to rise. Again, for the flavor and texture to develop you don't want to rush this step. When the dough has risen abut half way preheat the oven to 425 with the rack in the center position. it's better to underrise, then overrise the dough - it will continue to rise in the oven (it's called oven spring) until the yeast dies from the heat - if the dough is overrisen the bread will sink - not fatal, just not as pretty - remember what I said slicing the bread. The bread should bake for about 35-40 minutes. Not everyone bakes bread a such a high temperature-but this is what works for me. If you wish to glaze the bread to make the surface shinny, this is the time to do it - use either an egg white that has been beaten with 2 tablespoons water and a pinch of salt, or an egg yolk mixed with 2 tablespoons milk or cream. The second glaze makes the surface of the dread softer than the first one.

The easiest way to tell if the bread is cooked is to use an instant-read thermometer. Insert it in the center of the bread after 30 minutes of baking. When it reads 190 the bread is baked. I let my breads cool in the turned off oven with the door opened.Hope this helps - Lora

                        -- such as blueberries or raspberries
                        -- or strawberries or chopped mango
                        spoonfuls of sugar -- as needed

Fruit Scones -- Using the basic Sweet Milk Scones recipe, add up to 1/2 Cup of soft fruit such as blueberries, raspberries, sliced strawberries, or chopped mango along with a few spoonfuls of sugar if needed, to the dough before it is rolled out.


Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

Functions of Baking Ingredients

------------------------------------------------------------------------ By Sharon Lauterbach, Extension Assistant Julie A. Albrecht, Extension Food Specialist ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a list of baking ingredients and a description of the function each performs in baked goods. While substitutions can be made, varying the proportions of ingredients in a recipe alters the texture and flavor of the finished product.

FLOURS

Flour provides the structure in baked goods. Wheat flour contains proteins that interact with each other when mixed with water, forming gluten. It is this elastic gluten framework which stretches to contain the expanding leavening gases during rising. The protein content of a flour affects the strength of a dough. The different wheat flour types contain varying amounts of the gluten forming proteins. Hard wheat, mainly grown in midwestern U.S. has a high protein content. Soft wheat, grown in southern U.S. has less protein. In yeast breads, a strong gluten framework is desirable, but in cakes, quick breads and pastries, a high protein flour makes a tough product.

Bread flour is a hard wheat flour with about 12 percent protein. Bread flour is used for yeast raised bread because the dough it produces has more gluten than dough made with other flours. Sufficient gluten produces a light loaf with good volume. Slices hold together, rather than crumble.

Cake flour is a soft wheat flour that is 7.5 percent protein. The lower gluten content causes products to have a tender, more crumbly texture that is desirable in cake.

All purpose flour is blended during milling to achieve a protein content of 10.5 percent. This medium protein flour can be used for all baking purposes. If using all purpose flour in place of cake flour in a recipe, substitute 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons all purpose flour for 1 cup cake flour.

Whole wheat flour may be substituted for part of the white flour in yeast and quick bread recipes, but the volume of the finished product will be reduced. Whole wheat flour contains the nutritious germ and bran as well as the endosperm of the wheat kernel. Bran particles cut through the gluten during mixing and kneading of bread dough, resulting in a smaller, heavier loaf. If substituting a very coarsely ground whole wheat flour for all purpose flour, use 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour for every cup of all purpose flour. To substitute whole wheat flour in a white bread recipe, use half whole wheat and half bread flour for the best results.

Wheat germ, though not a flour, is often used in place of part of the flour in recipes for flavor and fiber. Protein, vitamins, minerals, and polyunsaturated fats are concentrated in the germ of grain kernels. Wheat germ, preferably toasted, can be used in place of up to 1/3 of the flour in a recipe.

The following non-wheat grain products are often used in baked goods. They are rich in protein but most do not have the potential for developing gluten. For this reason, at least 1 cup of wheat flour should be used for every 1 cup of non-wheat flour so the product will not become too heavy.

Rye flour is often used in combination with wheat flour for bread. Light rye flour can be successfully substituted for 40 percent of wheat flour in a recipe without loss of volume. Medium and dark rye flours should be limited to 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the total flour amount.

Triticale flour is a hybrid of wheat and rye. It has an average protein content higher than that of wheat flour. In yeast bread dough, triticale flour has better handling properties than rye flour because it will form gluten, but does not handle as well as wheat dough. For a good quality dough, ferment yeast dough made with triticale flour for a shorter period than wheat flour dough.

Oat flour has a relatively high protein content, 17 percent, but does not form gluten. Oat flour can be substituted for as much as 1/3 of wheat flour in bread.

Corn meal is coarsely ground dried corn. Corn flour is more finely ground corn. Both corn flour and corn meal contain 7-8 percent protein on a dry basis. Neither corn meal nor corn flour will form gluten. A grainy texture in cornbread can be avoided by mixing the cornmeal with the liquid from the recipe, bringing to a boil, and cooling before mixing with the other ingredients.

Rice flour has about 6.5-7 protein and does not form gluten. For people who do not tolerate gluten, rice flour is an acceptable substitute for wheat, barley, rye or oat flours. In baked products, 7/8 cup of non-waxy rice flour can be used in place of 1 cup all purpose wheat flour.

Potato starch flour, another non-gluten forming flour is usually used in combination with other flours. It has a mild potato taste. For substitutions, 5/8 cup of potato flour can be used for 1 cup of all purpose flour.

Soy flour contains 50 percent protein and is used primarily to boost the protein content of baked goods. Soy flour cannot form gluten and does not contain starch. Its use in large amounts affects the taste of baked goods and causes them to brown quickly. An acceptable substitution is to take 2 tablespoons flour out of each cup of flour in a recipe and add 2 tablespoons soy flour.

SWEETENERS

Sucrose, (table sugar) has many functions in food other than providing sweetness. In small amounts, added sugar helps yeast begin producing gas for raising yeast dough. Sugar in large amounts slows yeast fermentation; in a very sweet dough the rising time is longer. Sugar tenderizes dough and batter products and may help the baked product to brown. Moisture is retained better in sweetened breads than in unsweetened breads. It is the sugar in cookie dough that causes spreading to occur during baking. Reducing the amount of sugar by more than 1/3 can cause loss of tenderness, moisture, browning, and sweetness. The volume may increase in a bread recipe when sugar is reduced.

Fructose in crystal form is nearly twice as sweet as sucrose and is more expensive. Fructose attracts more water than sugar, therefore, fructose sweetened products tend to be moist. Baked products made with fructose will be darker than if they were made with sucrose.

Honey is sweeter than sugar because it contains fructose. Honey has a distinctive flavor. When using honey in place of sugar, use 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon honey in place of 1 cup sugar and reduce the other liquid ingredients by 2 tablespoons. Even when liquid is reduced, a product that contains honey will be moist because the fructose absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. Too much honey may cause the product to become too brown.

Molasses imparts a dark color and strong flavor to baked foods. It is not as sweet as sugar. When using molasses in place of sugar, use 1-1/3 cups molasses for 1 cup sugar and reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by 5 tablespoons. Because molasses is more acidic than sugar, it may be necessary to add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda for each cup of molasses used in substitution for sugar. Replace no more than 1/2 the sugar called for in the recipe with molasses.

The following artificial sweeteners are available for home use. They provide sweetness to homemade foods but lack the browning, tenderizing, and moisture retaining properties provided by table sugar. Specially formulated recipes are often needed to make a product with acceptable texture and appearance when using artificial sweeteners. Because the different low-calorie sweeteners vary in sweetness and bulk, package directions must be followed for the amount to use in place of sugar.

Saccharin is a heat stable noncaloric sweetener that, in its pure form is 200-300 times as sweet as sucrose. Bulking agents are added to saccharin products to aid in measuring. Saccharin has a bitter aftertaste.

Acesulfame K (Sweet OneSM) is a very low calorie sweetener that is 200 times as sweet as sucrose. It is heat stable so it can be used in baked goods. For improved texture in baked products, use acesulfame K in combination with granulated sugar. Acesulfame K reportedly has no unpleasant aftertaste.

Aspartame, commonly known as NutrasweetSM, is not heat stable so it is not an appropriate sweetener for baked goods.

                  Functions Of Baking Ingredients Part 2

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

SALT

Salt is used to enhance the flavors and sweetness of other ingredients in food. If salt is omitted or reduced, other spices or flavorings in the recipe should be increased slightly. In yeast dough, salt slows yeast fermentation. Omitting or reducing the amount of salt in yeast dough can cause the dough to rise too quickly, adversely affecting the shape and flavor of bread.

LEAVENING AGENTS

Baking Soda produces gas for leavening when combined with an acidic ingredient such as vinegar, lemon juice, or molasses. The volume of quick breads, cookies, cakes, and some candies depends largely on the amount of baking soda added to the batter or dough. Reducing the amount of baking soda without replacing it with another leavening agent will reduce the volume and lightness of the finished product.

Baking powder contains baking soda and the right amount of acid to react with it. Batters made with double acting baking powder rise twice; once when dry and moist ingredients are mixed together, and again when the product is baked.

Yeast is a living microorganism until it is destroyed by heat. As yeast grows and multiplies it gives off carbon dioxide which causes the dough to rise. Its action is affected by the addition or deletion of other ingredients such as salt and sugar. Using less yeast than specified in a recipe causes the dough to take longer to reach the desired volume in the rising stages.

FATS

Fat, in the form of solid shortening, margarine, or butter; or in the liquid form of oil contributes tenderness, moistness, and a smooth mouthfeel to baked goods. Fats enhance the flavors of other ingredients as well as contributing its own flavor, as in the case of butter. In baked goods such as muffins, reducing the amount of fat in a recipe results in a tougher product because gluten develops more freely. Another tenderizing agent such as sugar can be added or increased to tenderize in place of the fat. A small amount of fat in a yeast dough helps the gluten to stretch, yielding a loaf with greater volume.

Shortening: Shortening is 100 percent fat and is solid at room temperature. It is often made of hydrogenated (solidified by adding hydrogen) vegetable oils, but sometimes contains animal fats. The flakiness of pastry comes from solid fat such as shortening or lard rolled in layers with flour. In some recipes for cookies or cake, shortening is creamed with sugar to trap air. A lighter product will result. There are emulsifiers in shortening to help emulsify shortening and liquid. This means that oil and water stay mixed together, creating an even distribution of flavors and a consistent texture in batters and dough.

Butter is made from cream and has a fat content of at least 80 percent. The remaining 20 percent is water with some milk solids. Butter imparts a good flavor without a greasy mouthfeel to baked goods because it melts at body temperature.

Margarine is made from fat or oil that is partially hydrogenated, water, milk solids, and salt. Vitamins and coloring are usually added also. The fat or oil can be of animal or vegetable origin. Margarine has the same ratio of fat to non-fat ingredients as butter (80:20), and can be used interchangeably with butter.

Reduced fat substitutes have less than 80 percent fat. These do not work the same as butter or margarine in baked goods, though some specially formulated recipes can be found on the packages of these products. Fat free margarines also are available and contain no fat. These margarines are best used as spreads.

Oil is used in some muffin, bread and cake recipes. Oil pastry is mealy rather than flaky. To substitute oil for butter or margarine, use 7/8 cup oil for 1 cup butter or margarine. If oil is used in place of a solid fat for some cake recipes, the texture will be heavier unless the sugar and egg are increased.

EGGS

Eggs serve many functions in baked goods. They add flavor and color, contribute to structure, incorporate air when beaten, provide liquid, fat, and protein, and emulsify fat with liquid ingredients. Reducing or omitting egg yolks can result in less tenderness. Reducing or omitting egg whites can result in less volume. Cakes made without the emulsifying action from the egg yolk may not have a uniform flavor and texture. If a low fat, low cholesterol baked product is desired, use 2 egg whites for 1 whole egg; the white has very little fat or cholesterol. When a recipe calls for an egg, the best size to use is a 2 oz. Grade A large egg.

LIQUIDS

Liquids are necessary in baked goods for hydrating protein, starch and leavening agents. When hydration occurs, water is absorbed and the chemical changes necessary for structure and texture development can take place. Liquids contribute moistness to the texture and improve the mouthfeel of baked products. When water vaporizes in a batter or dough, the steam expands the air cells, increasing the final volume of the product.

Milk contributes water and valuable nutrients to baked goods. It helps browning to occur and adds flavor. When making yeast dough, milk should be scalded and cooled before adding to other ingredients. This is done to improve the quality of the dough and the volume of the bread.

Juice may be used as the liquid in a recipe. Because fruit juices are acidic, they are probably best used in baked products that have baking soda as an ingredient.

A glance at gluten

Copyright (c) 1998 Nando.net
Copyright (c) 1998 The Associated Press

(February 22, 1998 00:12 a.m. EST http://www.nando.net) - Wheat gluten
facts:

What is it?

In its finished form, wheat gluten is a fine powder that acts as a binding
agent to strengthen, add texture and improve the elasticity of food. It's
the natural protein portion of wheat that is extracted after milling.

What are its primary uses?

Wheat gluten helps multi-grain breads rise. In breakfast cereals, it adds
protein to fortify nutritional value. Wheat gluten is a binding agent in
processed meats and canned pet foods.

How is it made?

Flour produced in the milling operation is processed with water to extract
vital wheat gluten, which contains 75 percent to 80 percent protein. A
co-product of the process is wheat starch.

                           Handmade Bread Bowls

Recipe By     :adapted from various recipes in the Breadbakers Archives
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                Hand Made

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  very warm water -- (120 to 130 degrees)
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  1 3/4           cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Fleischmann's RapidRise Yeast
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  water

Mix together whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup bread flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add very warm water to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes.

Grease outsides of six 10 ounce custard cups. Place cups upside down on ungreased cookie sheet. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll or pat each piece into 7" circle on lightly floured surface. Shape dough circles over outsides of cups. Cover and let rise in warm place 15 - 20 minutes or until slightly puffy.

Heat oven to 375F. Mix egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water; brush gently over bread bowls. Bake 18 - 22 minutes or until golden brown. Carefully lift bread bowls from custard cups - bread and cups will be hot. Cool bread upright on wine rack.

Success Tip: When placing the dough circle over the cup, don't let the dough curl under the edge of the cup. It will bake onto the edge of the cup and be difficult to remove. If some of the dough should bake onto the edge, use the point of a paring knife to carefully separate it from the cup.

Try This: These bread bowls are not only fun to use but are also great to eat. Fill the bowl with a crisp green salad and serve as a side dish. Or fill it with a thick, chunky stew or your favorite main-dish salad.

NOTES : I generously borrowed from several recipes in the archives to make these bread bowls last week. Many or most, can't remember which, of those recipes were for bread machines, so those of you who chose to not use them will appreciate these directions. The hardest part was finding the custard cups--I had to go to three different stores and didn't want a substitute.

  1                cup  pineapple juice at room temperature
  3                     eggs

In a large bowl, combine 3 cups flour, potato flakes, sugar, salt, ginger, vanilla, and yeast. In medium saucepan, heat milk, water, and margarine until very warm (120-130F). Add warm liquid, pineapple juice, and eggs to flour mixture. Blend with electric mixer at low speed until well moistened; beat at medium speed for 4 minutes.

By hand, stir in 3 cups of flour to form a stiff dough. On a floured surface, knead in 1/2 to 1 cup flour until smooth, about 5 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl. Cover with clean towel. Let rise until doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Punch dough down.

This is a very light dough and very tasty. It can be shaped into dinner rolls of any shape. I also use this dough to make cinnamon rolls or bread. After shaping the dough into desired forms, let it rise until doubled in size. Bake dinner rolls for 15-20 minutes in a 350F oven (until browned).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3          cups  Flour -- Unbleached
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  2                Tsp  Cream Of Tartar
                        Salt -- To Taste
  4               Tbsp  Butter -- (1/2 Stick)
     3/4          cups  Milk
  1           teaspoon  dried herbs
                        -- or 2 tsp fresh herbs

Herb Scones -- Add 1 teaspoon dried herbs, or 2 teaspoons (or more) chopped
fresh herbs, to the basic dough before rolling out.  (We usually use dried
minced onion -- 2 Tablespoons, and dried parsley -- 1 to 2 Tablespoons
).  The author suggests:  "tarragon is good with a chicken-based dish;
basil or oregano are sublime with tomatoes; chopped cilantro and red pepper
make a spirited addition to soups of Asian or southwestern origin.  For a
truly intense herb scone, add 1/3 to 1/2 Cup pesto sauce to the dough along
with the milk, keeping in mind that extra flour will be needed on the board
to compensate for the extra liquid."

Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge:
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose white flour
  1                cup  water at room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  instant active dry yeast
                        For the dough:
     1/2      teaspoon  instant active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all purpose white flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  non-fat dry milk
                        -- or 1 tablespoon Lora Brody's Bread
                        Dough Relaxer
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- scant

Make the sponge the night before or at least 4 hours ahead:

Mix the sponge ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Cover and allow to rest overnight at room temperature.

Dough:
Place the sponge and the remaining ingredients in either a food processor fitted with the plastic blade, an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook or a bread machine programmed for DOUGH CYCLE. Food processor: Process for an additional 45 seconds after the flour is absorbed. Rest 10 minutes, then process an additional 30 seconds. Allow to rise in the food processor until doubled in bulk. Mixer: mix on low speed for 2 minutes, then mix on medium speed for 2 more minutes.

The dough should be very sticky, full of air bubbles and extremely elastic. Line a heavy duty baking sheet with parchment and sprinkle it lightly with corn meal. Pour and scrape the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface.
 Use a dough scraper to cut it in half. Gently stretch each half into a rougher rectangle about 1/2" thick. Dimple the surface with your fingertips.
 Cover with oiled plastic wrap and allow to rise until puffy.

Preheat the oven to 400 with the rack in the center position. Bake the Ciabatta for about 20 minutes, or until they just start to brown. For a crisper crust, spray the loaves 2-3 times during baking. Cool on racks before eating.

NOTES : The dough for this rustic, flat, slipper shaped loaf from Italy's lake district is custom made for machine mixing - especially the bread machine. So slack and wet it's more like a batter than a dough, it yields a chewy interior punctuated with large, irregularly shaped holes. Don't be tempted to add more flour - this dough isn't suppose to form a ball.

                        *****

You are baking not only in a high place - but in a dry place that can have sudden changes in barometric pressure. All these issues impact on how yeasted bread kneads, rises and bakes.

Liquid: people who bake in dry conditions have to compensate for dehydrated ingredients. Flour is hydroscopic: it acts like a sponge. The drier your environment, the drier your flour will be. Dry dough makes dry, uninteresting bread. It is essential to add additional liquid to doughs made in dry climates. Liquid is anything that pours - and anything that melts during the baking - such as cheese. Fresh fruits and vegetables add liquid to dough as it is extracted during the knead cycle. Pureed fruits and vegetables are considered liquids.

The more liquid in a bread (to a certain point) the more interesting, complex and varied the crumb and crust. There is no hard and fast rule about exactly how much extra liquid to add - you have to feel the dough to know. With practice, you'll be able to figure out how much liquid to add. Whole wheat and other "dark" flours require more liquid than white flour. Bread machines are great places to knead and proof (rise) slack (wet) doughs. The problem with baking a slack dough in the bread machine is the more often than not the vertical loaf cannot sustain itself and collapses either during or immediately after baking. If you wish to use the bake cycle in the machine you must be much more careful in the amount of additional liquid to add. This will be determined by feel and practice. You will have far more success if you give up the "overnight" or time/delay mode.

Flour: it is essential to use the finest quality flour when making bread - especially at high altitude. When choosing white flour, look for unbleached, unbromated flour that has at least 12 grams of protein per cup. Check the nutritional panel (remember that the measurements are given in 1/4 cups). This amount of protein will give you about the right amount of gluten to form an elastic dough. Whole grain flours (typically lower in protein) should be used in combination with good quality white flour. Adding Lora Brody's Bread Dough Enhancer will give your flour the extra strength required to make a well conditioned, high gluten dough that will perform very well at high altitudes. The Sourdough Enhancer has the same ingredients as the regular Enhancer plus dehydrated sourdough starter for a natural sourdough taste and texture. The Enhancers also have 2 naturally occurring yeast boosters and dough conditioners: ascorbic acid and diastatic malt (made from roasted barley).

Yeast: When yeast feeds on the carbohydrates in the flour, sugar and other ingredients in your dough, the by-product is carbon dioxide. When this carbon dioxide expands in the dough it forms air pockets (sometimes very tiny, sometimes much larger). The expanding gas pushing these air pockets throughout the dough makes the bread rise. The longer and slower this process is, the more complex and sophisticated the taste, and texture of the finished bread, and the happier you will be with the results. The decreased air pressure in high altitudes means that there is less air pressure pushing back against these air pockets, so the bread rises higher and more rapidly than it should. Typically, the dough will rise way up, then collapse during the baking process since the structure of the bread cannot support the volume of dough. Decreasing the amount of yeast by 1/3 to 1/2 the amount called for in the recipe will certainly help. It is important to use best quality instant active yeast (not rapid rise). I like both Red Star and Saf/Instant.

The other thing that will help is
to allow the dough to have an additional long, slow rise before it is formed and baked. After the first knead and rise, punch down the dough and place it in a large heavy duty zip-lock plastic bag and refrigerate it from 2 - 24 hours. If you are using a bread machine, program for manual and remove the dough after the final cycle. After this time the dough can be formed and given a final rise before baking. If you have a programmable machine like the Zojirushi, you can place the dough back in the bread pan, program for "Final Rise" and the "Bake". Don't allow the dough to over-rise during this last proofing - remember that it will rise more in the oven. Sugar: when making sweet breads it is advisable to cut back on sweeteners (including honey, molasses and maple syrup as well as dried fruits such as raisins) which tenderize the gluten structure and sometime can result in the center of the loaf collapsing. Use 1/4 to 1/3 less than the amount specified in the recipe.

Salt: salt acts as a yeast retardent. Don't bake bread at high altitude without it.

Oven temperature: at altitudes higher than 3500 feet reduce the oven temperature by 25, but keep the baking time the same. Bread is done when it reaches an internal temperature of 190 -200 (use an instant read thermometer). Try to prevent overbaking as this will contribute to dryness.

Buy vanilla beans and split them lengthwise without cutting them in half.
Place the cut beans in a jar filled with white liquor (e.g., Vodka). Let
the vanilla age for several weeks before you begin to use it. Thereafter,
as the vanilla is used, replace it by adding more white liquor to the jar
(there is no need to age it again).

Homemade pure vanilla makes wonderful gifts packaged in jars of various shapes.

                             Homemade Yogurt

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  1% or 2% milk -- (4 cups)
     3/4           cup  powdered Carnation milk
  1         tablespoon  or so plain yogurt with active cultures

Mix the milk and powdered milk together with a slotted spoon in a 2-quart bowl. (I use an Anchor-Hocking 2-quart glass measuring cup/mixing bowl. That way I can measure right in the bowl, plus, it has a plastic lid.) The milk then has to be heated to 180 degrees. Heat it in the microwave if you have one, otherwise you have to put it in a kettle and heat it on the stove and keep stirring it.

It works for me to heat it on Medium for 10 minutes in the microwave, stir it, and heat it for 5 more minutes on High. Check with a thermometer to make sure the temperature of the milk is then 180 degrees. Put the bowl on a rack on the counter, loosely covered with plastic wrap or the bowl lid, and allow to cool at room temperature for 1 1/2 hour. At this point, the temperature of the milk should be between 90 and 120 degrees. Don't use it until it reaches this range or it will be too hot and kill the bacteria, or too cool for the bacteria to work.

Put the tablespoon of plain yogurt into a small bowl or glass measuring cup and use a little whisk or a fork to mix it with a half-cup or so of the cooled milk. Pour this mixture into the bowl with the rest of the milk and stir together well.

Pour the milk into four glass bowls and cover them. I was able to find some clear glass bowls with approximately a two-cup capacity that came with plastic lids, and they work very well. I think Pyrex makes something similar.

If you have a gas oven, set them on the bottom rack of the oven with only the pilot light on and leave it undisturbed until it thickens. (Sometimes I turn the oven on the lowest temperature for just a minute or so if it's a cold day to make sure it's warm. If you don't have a gas oven, a heating pad set on a low, cozy temperature should work, too.) Keep it warm and it should be thick in about three hours.

The most important thing to know, as far as I'm concerned, is that when th e yogurt looks done, it IS done. Years ago when I bought a yogurt maker, the directions said to let it incubate for 12 hours and it was so sour it was like aspirin. If you put it in the fridge as soon as it thickens--the time will vary, depending on how fresh your culture is--it will be just barely
tart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- (3 to 3 1/2)
  2           packages  active dry yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2               cups  water
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  1 1/2           cups  muesli

1. In a large mixing bowl, stir together 2 cups of the all-purpose flour, the
yeast, and cinnamon; set aside.
2. In a small saucepan, heat and stir water, honey, butter, and salt just
until warm (120 - 130 degrees) and butter almost melts. Add honey mixture to
the flour mixture. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30
seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl constantly. Then beat on high speed
for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in whole wheat flour, muesli, and
as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the
remaining all-purpose flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth
and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape the dough into a ball. Place dough
in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the surface. Cover and let
rise in a warm place until double (about 45 minutes).
4. Punch dough down. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough
in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Lightly grease two 8 x 4 x 2-inch
loaf pans; set aside.
5. Shape each half into a loaf by gently pulling into a loaf shape, tucking
edges beneath. Place the shaped loaves in the prepared pans. Cover and let
rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (about 30 minutes).
6. Bake in a 375F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until bread sounds
hollow when you tap the top with your fingers (if necessary, cover loosely
with foil the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning). Remove
loaves from pans and cool on wire racks. Place in an airtight container or
bag and store at room temperature for up to 3 days.

TO MAKE AHEAD: Prepare and bake bread as directed; cool completely. Place
bread in a freezer container or bag and freeze for up to 3 months. Before
serving, thaw bread at room temperature for 2 hours.

  2        tablespoons  honey
                        zest of one lemon
  1         tablespoon  chopped walnuts

I have a wonderful scone recipe that came from a book titled "From Celtic
Hearths" by Deborah Krasner.  It was a Christmas gift about 10 years ago
and I have used it OVER and OVER again.  The author credits the recipe
to  "Scottish Cookery" by Catherine Brown Glenfiddich.  The recipe below is
for Sweet Milk Scones which I basically use as a starting point and then
add whatever we are in the mood for. Most often we eat Parsley and Onion
Honey Scones -- Using the basic recipe for Sweet Milk Scones, substitute 1/4 Cup orange juice and 1/2 Cup milk for the 3/4 Cup milk, and add 2 Tablespoons honey, the grated zest of 1 lemon, and 1 Tablespoon chopped walnuts to the dough before rolling it out.

Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry

                        *****

My starter's been going for over 25 years (and supposedly was 100 years old before I got it) and it's not sour, so don't count on age. Sorry, but the only thing I've found that works is adding a "Day Two" ... After you've expanded your sourdough on Day One (by taking it out of the refrigerator and adding flour and water and letting it sit overnight), mix the amount required by your recipe with about 2 cups of the flour and the rest of the dry ingredients and let it sit overnight again. Add the rest of the stuff the next day and bake as usual. When I did this, my bread was sour.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                pkg  dry yeast
     1/4          cups  sugar -- divided
  2               cups  warm water -- 105 to 115 degrees F
  6               cups  bread flour -- divided
     1/3          cups  vegetable oil
  1                tsp  salt
     1/2           tsp  Anise Seed -- crushed
     1/2           tsp  fennel seeds -- crushed
                        vegetable cooking spray

Dissolve yeast and 1 Tbsp sugar in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add the remaining 3 Tbsp sugar, 2 cups bread flour, oil, salt and seeds; stir with a wire whisk until smooth. Add 3 1/2 cups bread flour, stirring to form a soft dough.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic
(about 10 minutes). Add enough of the remaining flour, 1 Tbsp at a time, to prevent the dough
from sticking to hands.

Place dough in a large bowl, coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and
let rise in a warm place (85F) free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Punch
dough down; turn out onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half, and roll each portion
into a 14" x 18" rectangle. Roll up the rectangles, starting with a short edge, pressing firmly to
eliminate air pockets; pinch ends to seal. Place each roll, seam side down, in a 9" x 5" loaf pan
coated with cooking spray. Cover, and let dough rise 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Uncover dough, and bake at 375F for 35 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when
tapped. Remove bread from pans; let cool on wire racks.

Yield:
  "2 Loaves"

     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garam masala

  3               cups  bread flour
  1 1/8           cups  whole wheat flour
  2          teaspoons  yeast

As needed: add milk, or water 1-2 TBS at a time.

Notes, I used no fat sour cream, as I don't tolerate yogurt at all. I needed around 4 TBS of water, and also had to help along the blade by moving around the dough, as it is very heavy. Tasted very very good with dark honey. Will try with Apple Butter

                       Ingredients And Volume Tips

Recipe By     :Robin Hood Flour
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

Ingredient Tips:

1.Fats
2.Sugar
3.Eggs
4.Yeast
5.Flavourings

TIP #1 Fats

Fats such as butter, margarine and oil have a lubricating effect on the gluten's meshwork. In other words, adding fats will permit your dough to stretch more easily.
Fats help improve flavour, tenderness and quality of the bread. Butter is usually used in rich, sweet and festive breads. It is important to use shortening to grease your pans, instead of butter or oil which can cause the bread to stick to the pan or burn.

TIP #2 Sugar

Sugar is quick food for the yeast, helping it to produce carbon dioxide gas that allows the yeast to activate.
Sugar adds flavour to breads and can give a golden colour to the crust. Substitute brown sugar, molasses or honey for fancy or whole grain breads. Too much sugar can slow down the yeast action or stop it from acting altogether.

TIP #3 Eggs

Eggs add nutrition and colour, provide volume and bind ingredients together.
Use large eggs in recipes unless another size is specified. Used in large quantities, eggs will colour dough yellow. Egg products can replace whole eggs in many recipes.

TIP #4 Yeast

Sprinkling active dry yeast over a mixture of warm water and sugar, and letting it stand for 10 minutes, will allow the yeast to proof or start to ferment.
Too much heat will kill the yeast.
Too much sugar will cause the yeast to rise at a slower rate than normal. 1 package of active dry yeast or approximately 1 tablespoon (15 mL).

TIP #5 Flavourings

Extracts, flavours and liqueurs should be added to ingredients at room temperature.

Volume Tips:

To avoid the dough spilling over the pan, do not let it rise to more than double its size before kneading.
Too much flour or salt, or too little, will inhibit the gluten's performance and the dough will not rise to its full potential. Substituting finer grain flours for coarse or heavier grain flours to allow gluten to stretch can prevent a flat or compact loaf. Use the amount of flour your recipe calls for to ensure the dough will hold its shape while baking.
Maintain the oven temperature your recipe calls for, or one side of your loaf may rise higher than the other.

     1/2          tsp.  baking soda
  2 1/2           tsp.  yeast

* (I use Fleischmann's instant yeast purchased in 1 lb.vacuum packs from BJ's)

Add a little extra flour if needed to produce a soft dough. Add 1/3 cup of raisins near the end of the kneading cycle. (It seems they break up too much if added at the beginning.) When the dough cycle is complete, shape into a flattened ball and place in a greased 8" cake pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled. Cut a cross in the middle of the loaf and immediately place into a preheated 375* oven. Bake 30 - 40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan and cool on rack.

NOTES : This is a recipe posted in response to the request for Irish-related breads - just in time for St. Patrick's Day. While I realize that most Irish soda breads only use baking soda instead of yeast, I have found this variation to be delicious. I use my zojirushi bread machine to prepare the dough and then shape and bake in the oven. Place these ingredients in the machine in the order given:

                Scones                          Sweet Breads & Cakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3          cups  Flour -- Unbleached
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  2                Tsp  Cream Of Tartar
                        Salt -- To Taste
  4               Tbsp  Butter -- (1/2 Stick)
     3/4           cup  Milk
                        ---
                        beaten egg or milk
  2        tablespoons  fruit jam

Jam Scones -- Make the basic recipe for Sweet Milk Scones and divide it in two. Roll out both pieces to 1/2 inch thickness, and form each into a large round or rectangle. Brush the edges of one piece with a beaten egg or milk, and spread 2 Tablespoons fruit jam to within an inch of the edge. Put the other piece of dough on top, and press lightly around the edges to secure the sandwich. Lightly score the top into squares, cutting only part way through; brush the top with beaten egg, and bake.

Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

NOTES : I have a wonderful scone recipe that came from a book titled "From Celtic
Hearths" by Deborah Krasner.  It was a Christmas gift about 10 years ago
and I have used it OVER and OVER again.  The author credits the recipe
to  "Scottish Cookery" by Catherine Brown Glenfiddich.  The recipe below is
for Sweet Milk Scones which I basically use as a starting point and then
add whatever we are in the mood for. Most often we eat Parsley and Onion

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               tbsp  sugar
  2                tsp  active dry yeast
  2               cups  warm water
  4               cups  bread flour -- (4 to 5)
                        -- or unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2            tsp  salt
     1/4           tsp  ground mahleb -- (optional)
  1                 lg  egg -- beaten with
  1               tbsp  cold water -- for egg wash
  3               tbsp  sesame seeds -- (3 to 4)

Makes 32 bread rings

Whisk the sugar, yeast, and water together in a medium bowl. Stirring in one direction with a wooden spoon, add 2-3 cups of flour, a cup at a time, mixing until incorporated. Stir for a minute, about 100 strokes. Let this sponge rest, covered, for 10 minutes.

Stir the salt and mahleb into the sponge. Continuing to stir with the wooden spoon, and still stirring in one direction, gradually add as much additional flour as the dough can incorporate. Then turn it onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 8-10 minutes, adding more flour only if necessary. The dough should be smooth and elastic.

Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turn to coat the dough with oil, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temp until doubled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Lightly oil two baking sheets and keep them close to your work space. Punch the dough down, turn it out onto a work surface, and cut it into 32 pieces. Lightly flour the work surface, then use your palms to roll each piece of dough into a rope 6-7 inches long. Pinch the ends of each one together to form a circle and place the circles on the oiled baking sheets, leaving at least 1/2 inch between them. Cover and allow to rise for 30 minutes.
Set the oven racks in the upper part of the oven and preheat the oven to 400F.
Brush the ka'kat with the egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake until nicely browned, about 20 minutes. To ensure the breads bake evenly, rotate the baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through the baking time. Transfer the baked breads to racks and cool for about 5 minutes before wrapping in a cloth to keep warm. These are best served warm.

These can be kept in a plastic bag at room temp for a day or two or wrapped airtight and frozen for a month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temp and crisp in a hot oven before serving.

NOTES : Was curious as to the authenticity of this recipe, so gave some to a few folks I know from that part of the world. They were thrilled to taste them...it made them all homesick....one man from Egypt started crying at the memory of eating these breads by the Nile.

MY NOTES: Very good! Very crisp crust when warm from the oven. Found 2 kinds of mahleb (mahlab) at the Mediterranean Grocery....a tan seed and something that looked like coarse, black coffee grounds. The store owner said to use the black stuff. Ground it in coffee grinder. Cooled breads on a rack. Were hard and rubbery the next day and could not taste or smell the mahlab.

                        ---
                        For the topping:
  6        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar -- firmly packed
  2               cups  pecans
                        ---
                        For the filling:
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
  1 1/2           cups  raisins
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  brandy

Ahead of time: make the filling by placing the raisins, orange juice and brandy in glass bowl. Cover and microwave for 4 minutes on high. Allow to cool to room temperature before proceeding.

For the filling: place all the ingredients in an electric skillet set at 250 or frying pan set over moderate heat. Stir until the mixture boils and then allow to simmer for 5 minutes.

To assemble the sticky buns: generously butter a 12" springform pan. Distribute the topping over the bottom of the prepared pan.

On a lightly floured work surface roll the doughnut into a rectangle that measures about 24 inches long and 8 inches wide. Brush the surface with the melted butter, reserving a little to brush the formed buns, and then scatter the raisins over the dough leaving a 1 inch clean boarder around the edges. If there is any liquid left over from soaking the raisins pour it over the pecan topping.

Starting with the long edge away from you roll the dough, jelly roll style to form a tight 24 inch roll. Use a knife or dough scraper to cut the roll into 18 slices and place each slice cut sides up and down approximately 1 1/2 inches apart on top of the pecan mixture. Brush the tops with the reserved butter then cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until barely double in bulk.

Pre-heat the oven to 325 with the rack in the center position. Bake the rolls about 40 minutes or until the crust is well browned and the sugar is bubbling up around the dough. The buns should have an internal temperate of 200 on an instant read thermometer. Remove the dish from the oven and immediately invert it onto a slope sided heat proof platter. The nut covered surface is the top. Scoop any topping still in the pan onto the buns. Cool for 15-20 minutes before serving.

To assemble and freeze: roll and cut the sticky buns and place them in the pan. Immediately cover with a layer of plastic wrap then a layer of heavy duty foil. Label and freeze for up to 4 months. Remove the foil and plastic wrap and place the dish in a cold oven. Close the door and turn the oven to 350. Check the buns after 30 minutes, covering the tops loosely with
 foil if they are getting too brown. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, checking the internal temperate, as above.

Yield: 18 sticky buns

NOTES : You know those sticky bun take out places that have sprouted up in malls everywhere? Well, I thought their buns were pretty swell until I started fooling around with some sweet dough and some left over caramelized pecans. Making these ten megaton babies is much easier than you'd expect- and a hell of a lot of fun as well. If you're in a big hurry you can use store bought frozen white dough. Thaw according to manufacture's instructions. These are really best about 20 minutes after they come out of the oven. They will keep at room temperature for about 8 hours - don't refrigerate, they'll love their wonderful texture.

                        Yellow -- green and purple
                        decorating sugars.*

Heat 1/2 cup milk until warm (105 to 115F ). In a large mixer bowl,
dissolve yeast in warm milk.  Stir in sugar and salt and mix well.  Let
stand a few minutes, or until bubbly.  Add 2 cups of the bread flour,
the butter, beaten eggs, lemon peel and nutmeg.  With an electric mixer,
beat on slow speed until all ingredients are moistened. Beat 3 minutes
on medium speed.  Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.

On a lightly floured surface knead dough until smooth and elastic,
adding more bread flour if needed, about 5 minutes.  Place dough in
well-buttered bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let dough rise
in a warm place (80 to 85F ) about 1 1/2 hours, or until dough doubles
in volume.

Punch down dough several  times to remove air bubbles. Shape into a rope
24 inches long and place on a buttered baking sheet.  Pinch the ends
together to form a ring.  Cover dough with a cloth and let it rise in a
warm place until it again doubles in volume, about 1 1/4 hours.

Preheat oven to 350F .

Whisk together the remaining egg and 1 Tablespoon milk; gently brush
over the top of the dough.  Bake 22 to 27 minutes or until golden and
cake sounds hollow when lightly tapped. [Internal temperature should
read 190F on an instant-read therm.]

Remove from baking sheet and cool completely on a wire rack.  Once the
cake is cool, press the doll, dried bean or nut gently into the bottom
of the cake so that it is hidden.

Frosting:

Combine confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon milk.  Stir
with a wire whisk until smooth. If icing is too thick, stir in another 1
tablespoon milk.  Spoon icing over top of ring, allowing it to run down
the sides.  Sprinkle with colored sugar, creating rows of each color
about 1 1/2 inches wide.  Repeat all around the ring.

YIELD: Makes 14 servings.

King Cake is made during Mardi Gras season (January 6 through the day before Ash Wednesday) in Louisiana and other parts of the south that celebrate Mardi Gras. It is basically a coffee cake, made in a ring, and can be plain (usually a mildly sweet egg/butter yeast dough) or filled in any number of ways -- fruit fillings, sweetened cream cheese, almond paste, etc. It is topped with a powdered sugar glaze which is sprinkled with three colors of sugar -- green, yellow and purple, the Mardi Gras colors. The plastic baby is inserted before baking, but it doesn't melt. The person who gets the baby is supposed to supply the next king cake, or have the next party at which the king cake is served.

NOTES : ".....This recipe from the American Butter Institute is more of a sweet bread than a cake. It is make with yeast and drizzled with a simple lemon frosting and then sprinkled with sugar in the Romanov colors."

*The person who found the treasurer in the cake last year must bake the
cake for this year's "fat Tuesday" or Mardi Gras.

* Alexis Romanov of the Russian royal family visited Mardi Gras in New
Orleans in 1872 and from hence forth, it is said, the celebration took
on the royal colors signifying justice, faith and power.

First, some info I omitted in my first posting: I've found it works well, when getting ready to shape your dough, if you spray the counter with non-stick pan spray, and then place your dough on it to shape. I like this better than shaping it on a floured counter.

Estimating sizes of bread pans: If you have used approximately 6 cups of flour in your dough, you can make 2 loaves in 6 cup pans. If you have used 8 cups of flour, this will make 2 loaves in 8 cup pans. If you used 5 cups of flour, use 2-6 cups pans, and the loaves will not be as big. You do not want to put too much dough into a pan, or the loaf will end up strangely shaped. You really need to measure the content of your pans yourself. I've found that the size on the pan is not always the true size---fill it with water, counting the cups it takes. Then you know the true size.

Now, using a Cuisinart---I'm not speaking generically for any food processor. In teaching classes over the years, I've found many other brands do not have the motor capacity to knead the dough without damage to the machine. Read your instruction manual. If your brand does not recommend bread making, don't.

There are 4 main sizes of Cuisinart F.Processors. The Classic, or 10; the 8 or 11; the 7 or 14; and the X. The Classic or 10 works best if you use no more than 4 cups of flour; the 8 or 11 work best with no more than 5 cups; the 7 or 14 with no more than 6 and the X with no more than 10 cups of flour. If you are using all whole wheat, cut the quantity down to 3,4,5 and 8 respectively as it is heavier and stickier. Used half and half, whole wheat and white, you can stick to the originally recommended quantities.

In any bread recipe that contains more than 3 1/2 cups of flour, always use the plastic (white) dough blade. It kneads the dough better with less strain on the motor.

Always put the dry ingredients in the machine first. I do not add my yeast in a dry state, but always proof it in a little liquid, with a pinch of sugar. After your dry ingredients are in, pulse once or twice to combine them. Add the butter in unmelted state, cut into 3-4 pieces, pulse again. Then proof your yeast in 1/4-1/2 cup of liquid and measure the remaining liquid into a cup. The larger amount of the liquid should be cold. Faucet cold water or milk out of the refrigerator, or whatever you are using. Turn the processor on and pour in the yeast mixture, then, in a slow steady stream, while the machine runs, pour in the remaining liquid. After it is all in, the dough should come together into a ball. DO NOT STOP THE MACHINE. Let the ball bounce around and around for about 45 seconds. Then stop the machine. I will assure you the dough is as fully kneaded as if you spent 10 minutes working it by hand. The dough is now ready for you to let it rise the first time. Proceed as you always have. Exceptions: if your dough is not coming together, but stays in small clumps, add water, 1 Tablespoon at a time. Allow it to continue bouncing, and then if needed, add another Tablespoon. If on the other hand the dough is too sticky, and doesn't clump at all, add flour, 1 or 2 Tablespoons at a time until it is right. If you run the machine too long, the dough will overheat and the yeast will be killed. I had one student who had tried before class to make bread, and had let the machine run 5 minutes. It died.

I mentioned using other ingredients in combination with the liquid. I had a question about how. If you want to vary your recipe by adding an egg, break it into your measuring cup and add liquid to the measure the recipe called for. If you want to use part sour cream, put it in your cup first, and then add liquid to the quantity called for. If your recipe calls for eggs, or sour cream in the first place, measure the liquid and then add the eggs &/or sour cream to the measuring cup, stir a bit and pour it in as if it were all liquid.

NOTES : Pure maple syrup, a smack of brown sugar, butter, vanilla and the
heady aroma of toasted walnuts make these scones very satisfying.  Pecans
can replace walnuts.

     2/3          cups  Milk -- Plus
                        A Few Drops More If Needed

Preheat oven to 425F.

Combine flour, sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt. Blend well. Cut butter into small pieces, and cut into dry mixture until it resembles fine crumbs. Slowly stir in the milk. Add enough milk so that the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add a few drops more if dough seems dry. It should be soft and pliable. Do not overly exercise the dough. Divide the dough in half.

Roll out half the dough on a floured board into a 13" sq. Dough should be thinner than 1/8". Trim the edges and lift it onto an ungreased cookie sheet, or roll over rolling pin and unroll onto the cookie sheet.

Use a sharp knife to score dough into 2" squares. Sprinkle the top with some of the remaining salt and press down into the dough. Repeat with remaining dough.

Bake in the preheated oven for 5 - 6 min, until the edges are slightly golden. Turn crackers over and bake 5 - 6 min more. Cool on racks. Break crackers apart when cool and store in an airtight tin.

Makes about 6 dozen small crackers.

Prepare brownie mix as directed on box.
Pour brownie mix in each ice cream cone, fill about 3/4 full. Place cones in microwave and nuke for a 2 minutes. Prepare frosting as directed on box, frost the cone cakes.

hint: For starters just microwave one to get a feel for how much batter to put in the cone and how much time to cook.

For a carrying tray cut an egg carton in half and wrap tin foil over the bottom portion. Poke each cone cake through the tin foil into an egg slot.

These are great for busy moms. They are ready for the kids to gormandize in just 10 minutes or so. Great for B-day parties at school, etc. Whenever I bring them to my boys school functions they are gone in seconds. Fun for the kids to make too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2             Lb  Strong Plain Flour
  1               Tbsp  Salt
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  1                Pkg  Easy Mix Dried Yeast
  2                 Lg  Eggs
  3               Tbsp  Vegetable Oil

This recipe makes 1 large plaited loaf, 4 1/2 pound loaves, 2 1 pound
loaves or 24 small rolls. The bread is very light and delicate and makes
excellent  toast when a day or so old.

Mix together the flour, salt, sugar and dried yeast in a large bowl.

Put one whole egg and one white in a measuring jug and reserve a yolk until
later. Add the oil to the jug and beat well. Make up to 15 fluid ounces
with hand-hot milk (you will need about 10 fl oz  milk but this depends on
the size of your eggs) stirring as the milk is added.

Pour the liquid into the flour mixture and mix, first with a fork and later
with your hands until the dough begins to cohere and leave the sides of the
bowl.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and scrape the bowl clean.

Knead the dough until smooth and elastic sprinkling on a LITTLE flour if
the dough proves impossibly sticky.

Put the dough back into the bowl which you have lightly oiled, cover
tightly with foil, cling film or a well fitting lid and leave in a warm
place until at  least doubled in size (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours).

Turn out and knead again until elastic.

Shape into loaves or rolls, cover with plastic film or a large plastic bag
and leave to rise 1 hour.

Take the reserved egg yolk, beat with a teaspoon of cold water and brush
this mixture over the tops of the risen bread. Do this with a light hand to
avoid  deflating the loaves.

If liked sprinkle the bread with sesame, poppy or caraway seeds or coarse salt.

Bake in a preheated oven 220C for 15 minutes by which time rolls should be
cooked. If baking loaves turn the heat down to 190C and bake for another
20  minutes for 1/2 pound loaves, 25 minutes for 1 pound loaves or 30
minutes for  a large plait.

All baking times are approximate and the loaves are cooked when they sound
hollow if tapped on the underside.

The mixing of the dough can equally well be done in a kitchen mixer.

  1 1/2           cups  oat groats
  1 1/2           cups  long grain brown rice
  1               cups  whole grain rye
  1 1/2           cups  whole grain triticale
  1               cups  whole grain buckwheat
  1               cups  millet
  1               cups  pearl barley
  1               cups  sesame seed -- (optional)

1 C mix = 3 C cooked.

I make a whole batch of the mixed grain and cook it and freeze in 1 cup portions. I add one or two cups to my whole wheat bread dough. (I live on Molokai, Hawaii, and can't get triticale, so my mix doesn't include that)

These are both good, the main problem is that it takes much longer to make them than to eat them up!

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water -- *
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3               cups  all purpose -- unbleached white
                        flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar or honey
  3                     gently rounded tablespoons Lora Brody's
                        Dough Relaxer
  2          teaspoons  yeast
                        For the glaze:
  1                     egg -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water

* (plus additional water if necessary to make a smooth, soft ball after the 1st few minutes of kneading)

Bread machine method : Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for Dough or Manual and press start. Check the dough after the first few minutes of kneading, adding additional water if necessary to make a smooth, soft, ball. At the end of the final cycle remove the dough and place it on a very lightly floured or lightly oiled work surface.

Food Processor and stand mixer method: Measure 1 cup warm water into a 2 cup measure. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and allow to dissolve, stirring to mix if necessary. Add the remaining dry ingredients to the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the plastic blade, or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix or process to combine the dry ingredients, then with the mixer on low speed, or the processor on, add the dissolved yeast and water. Processes until a ball forms, adding more water or flour if necessary, then process for 45 seconds, rest for 1 minute, then process for another 60 seconds. Allow the dough to rise in the processor until double in bulk. Process for an additional 40 seconds. Or knead in the mixer for 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and supple and no longer sticks to the bottom of the bowl. Place the dough either in a large freezer-strength zip lock plastic bag or an oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and allow it to rise until almost double in bulk.

To complete: Punch down the risen dough (gently deflate it with your fist) and place it on a very lightly floured or lightly oiled work surface. Spray or grease a heavy baking sheet . Roll the dough into a 18" x 5" rectangle. Use a pizza cutter. knife or bench knife to cut the dough lengthwise into 3 long strips, leaving the pieces connected at one end. Braid the strips without stretching them and secure the end by pinching it together and tucking it under the loaf. Place the braid on the prepared pan and brush with the egg glaze. Allow to rise, uncovered in a warm place until not quite double in bulk. Take care not to allow the bread to overrise - avoid the bubbles, spongy look on the crust. Pre-heat the oven to 400F, with the rack in the center position. Bake for 15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 375 and bake another 20 minutes or until the top is deep golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.

  2                Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- Scant Teaspoons

I was torn between two desires when it came to what I would be doing at the stroke of midnight New Years Eve. I wanted to be baking and I also wanted to be chatting with a friend online. (There were practical reasons for this, not just a desire to catch up on gossip...yeah, yeah, that's an excuse....<grin>) Since there is a flight of stairs between the kitchen and the computer, I decided to do both by letting my bread machine help.

I then decided to declare the bread in the machine (my first bread of the millennium) an omen of the coming century. I made up the recipe on the spot and I'm glad to say it rose just perfectly, turned just the right shade of beige, and while some might find the strong herb and cheese flavoring annoying in a sandwich bread, as the basis for toasted provolone cheese it is superb!

Blessings and happy new year to all!

Use regular white setting.

                Scones

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  whole-wheat flour
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4          cups  granulated sugar
     3/4           Tsp  salt
  1                Tsp  baking soda
  2 1/2            Tsp  baking powder
  2 1/2           cups  oats
  1               cups  dried sour cherries -- Rough Chopped
  300                G  (10 oz) chilled butter -- Cut In 1/2" Pieces
     2/3          cups  buttermilk
  1               Tbsp  heavy cream
  1               Tbsp  sanding sugar

This recipe uses whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and rolled oats for a hearty texture. Brush the top of each scone with heavy cream and sprinkle with sanding sugar for a crisp, glimmering finish. Serve scones fresh from the oven with butter, jam, or that British favorite, clotted cream.

Freezing the dough for at least two hours before baking keeps scones from spreading too much. The dough will keep in the freezer for up to three weeks, so keep some on hand for the overnight guests you might have this holiday season.

1. Line an 11-by-17-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine all dry ingredients, except sanding sugar, with the cherries in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add butter, and mix on medium-low speed until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk, and mix until combined.

2. Turn out the mixture onto a clean work surface. With hands, quickly pat mixture into a 16-by-3 1/2-inch rectangle that is 1 1/2-inches high. Score rectangle into ten triangles. Cover with plastic wrap, and transfer to the freezer for at least 2 hours.

3. Heat oven to 350F. Remove dough from the freezer, and cut into triangles with a sharp knife. Place scones two inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Brush scones with heavy cream, and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Bake until lightly golden, about 30 minutes.

                    Oatmeal Bread With Cooked Oatmeal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  coarse rolled oats
  1                cup  boiling water
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  1                tsp  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        -- (100 -115 approximately)
  1                cup  warm milk
  1               Tbsp  salt
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
  4               cups  [unbleached ]all-purpose flour -- (4 to 5)

Method: Electric Mixer

Mixing: Cook the oats in the boiling water until thickened, about 3 minutes. Pour into a large mixing bowl and allow to cool to lukewarm [about 20 minutes, jtr]. Meanwhile, stir the yeast and teaspoon of sugar into the warm water until dissolved, allow to proof. Add the warm milk, salt, brown sugar, and yeast mixture to the oats and stir well, then stir in 4 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time.

1st Knead & 1st Rise: Turn out on a floured board. Knead into a smooth, pliable, elastic dough, if necessary using as much as 1/2 to 1 cup, or more, of additional flour to get it to the right feel. (This will take about 10 minutes.) Shape the dough into a ball, put into a well-buttered bowl, and turn to coat on all sides. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

2nd Knead & 2nd Rise: Punch the dough down. Knead for 2 or 3 minutes and shape into two loaves. Thoroughly butter two 8 x 4 x 2-inch tins. Place the dough in the tins, cover, and let rise in a warm place until about even with the top of the tins, or almost doubled in bulk.

Baking: Preheat the oven to 375F , place the bread in the center of the lowest rack, and bake for about 45 to 50 minutes, [or until internal temperature reaches 190F on an instant read thermometer. Jtr]. Remove the loaves to a rack and cool.

Note: If you should want a very soft top crust, brush the loaves with melted butter when you bring them out of the oven.

YIELD: 2 small loaves

  1                tsp  lemon juice

Put into bread machine according to your machine's directions. I bake on the white bread cycle and remove when the baking is done. I think the taste of the bread is far superior if it is NOT allowed to cool in the machine. Depending on how much leftover cereal is used 2 to 3 tsp. extra water may be required.

Someone else was also looking for Hawaiian Bread recipes. I have never had this type of bread but I did see some recipes recently when I was looking for cinnamon roll recipes. The archives are a veritable gold mine.

NOTES : Someone on the list recently requested an oatmeal bread made from leftover cooked oatmeal. I have been making an oatmeal bread in the bread machine which does call for cooked oatmeal. The recipe itself gives measurements for cooking the oatmeal as you need it for the bread but I have just been using approximately 1/3 to 1/2 cup of leftover cooked oatmeal (often I will have cooked up a mixture ... oatmeal, kasha, corn meal, etc.). My machine is one of the old Wellbilt models which is still going strong.

Lightly spoon bread and oat flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife.

Combine 3/4 cup bread flour, warm water, and yeast in a large bowl; stir well with a whisk. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

Combine oats and boiling water in a small bowl. Stir in raisins, honey, and cinnamon; cool. Set aside.

Add 2 1/2 cups bread flour, oat flour, barley flour, salt and vinegar to yeast mixture. Add oatmeal mixture; stir until a soft dough forms (dough will feel tacky). Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes); add enough of remaining bread flour, 1 tbsp at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Shape into 2 (9-inch) oval loaves. Make 3 parallel cuts 1/4-inch deep across tops of loaves on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Spray tops with cooking spray. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 F), free from drafts, 30 minutes or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, the dough has risen enough.)

Preheat oven to 375 F.

Uncover dough. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove from baking sheet; cool on a wire rack.

                Scones

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- Unsifted
  2               Tbsp  sugar
  1               Tbsp  baking powder
  2                     lemons -- grated zest
     1/4           Tsp  salt
  4               Tbsp  unsalted butter -- Cut Into Pieces
  2                     eggs
     1/2          cups  heavy cream
     1/2           Tsp  Ground Cinnamon -- Mixed With
  2               Tbsp  Sugar -- For Sprinkling

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, lemon zest and salt. Cut in the butter with a fork or heavy duty electric mixer until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and cream. Add to the dry mixture and stir until a sticky dough is formed.

2. Turn out the shaggy dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until the dough holds together, about 6 times. Divide into three equal portions and pat each into a 1" thick round and about 6" in diameter. With a knife or straight edge, cut each round into quarters, making 4 wedges. The scones can also be formed by cutting out with a 3" biscuit cutter to make 10-12 smaller scones.

3. Place the scones about 1" apart on a greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the tops with the cinnamon sugar, if desired. Bake in the preheated oven until crusty and golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Serve immediately with homemade jam and butter.

  1               tbsp  milk

Combine bread and all-purpose flours, yeast, sugar, onion powder and salt in large bowl. Stir in very warm water and oil.

Transfer flour mixture to work surface. Knead until well blended and dough is stiff, about 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Transfer to greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place until almost tripled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Dust baking sheet with cornmeal and set aside.

Topping: Meanwhile, as the dough rises, bring small saucepan of water to boiling. Add sliced onion; cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Drain. Sprinkle with salt.

Once dough has risen, punch down. Let rest, covered, 10 minutes. Divide dough in half and shape into two 12 x 2 inch loaves. Transfer to baking sheet. With a razor or very sharp knife, make 4 diagonal slashes in each loaf.

Whisk together egg yolk and milk in small bowl. Brush over loaves. Top with onion rings.

Place bread in COLD oven. Turn oven on to 400F. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves are puffed, golden and sound hollow when tapped on bottom. Transfer to wire rack to cool slightly.

  1                Tsp  Garlic Salt
  1                Tsp  Paprika

This is my favorite ABM bread recipe. I have modified it a bit from the original (Which was not for an ABM) which was a 1970  Pillsbury Bake off  winning recipe.   This is what I make every time I have company.  It tastes  absolutely fantastic and its even better toasted the next day.  (If there  is any left)

I put the milk, water, and butter in the microwave and warm it up a bit, Then add the egg to the bowl and mix well, (make sure its not to hot or it  will kill the yeast, just luke warm) Add all the bread ingredients to the  ABM.  Set for dough and press start.  Keep an eye on it as this is 4 cups  of flour.  I have to help  the mixture get started in my Hitachi. Stir it a bit with a small rubber spatula.  You should watch it during the  beginning of the dough cycle and make sure you have the right amount of  flour as the size of the egg varies and it makes a big difference. The dough should be soft but not sticky.  Just add a bit of water or flour  to get the texture right.  It should form a nice ball in the middle of the pan.

  Lightly Grease a large cookie sheet:

Melt the 1/4 cup margarine in small saucepan, or microwave; stir in remaining filling ingredients. Set aside.

When dough is ready.  Punch down dough to remove all air bubbles. Roll dough into 18x12-inch rectangle. Cut dough lengthwise into three 18x4  strips.  Starting with the long side roll up into a 18 inch long tube.  Place all three tubes on the cookie sheet oblong from corner to corner. Braid and pinch the ends together.  Now take the filling and using a  teaspoon put the filling under (between?)the braids.   You should have just  enough filling to put into every crack on the loaf.  Spray with a non stick spray and cover with a piece of Plastic wrap.  Let rise for about 45  minutes, remove plastic and then put into a preheated  oven at 350F.  Bake  25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when  lightly tapped.  I have found that I prefer this bread a wee bit on the  light side rather then a deep golden brown.  To me it tastes better (more  moist) if not well done.  The bread  will rise more in the oven and makes  one very big beautiful loaf.  Its really not hard to do and it looks  fantastic.  Makes great toast, garlic bread, etc.

I am happy to share my rye recipe.  It is adapted from a formula used by
the American team in the Coup du Monde bread baking competition in Paris a
few years back.  It is a bit elaborate, and also requires some less than
common ingredients.  I am including notes and commentary for your
edification.  The formula is for about a 10.5# batch.  It can easily be cut
back to a smaller batch, although ideally you should end up with total
dough weight divisible by 18 oz. (which is a fun math challenge since the
formula is expressed in metric measures).  I recommend a good scale to any
baker who doesn't have one.

Soaker and Pre-ferment should be made approximately 8 hours ahead of dough
preparation.  Each should be covered after preparation to avoid surface
drying.  Preferment should be well risen, and just starting to recede, when
ready to use.  (I have cheated and made the dough only after about 4-6
hours.  I have also been distracted and not made the dough for 12 or 16
hours.  These variations are not recommended, although the end product was
still pretty good.)

Combine initial dry ingredients first.  Whisk with your hand or wire whisk
to disperse yeast, salt and sugar.  Add preferment, soaker and about 2/3 of
water and mix at low speed to incorporate all, about 2-3 minutes.  Add
onion, mix at low speed for another minute or so until incorporated.  At
this point, dough should be fairly firm, maybe even a bit overly dry with
some excess flour still remaining unincorporated.  Goal with a rye dough is
to have a heavy, well-developed but still slightly sticky end product.  Rye
is sticky stuff.  If dough is too dry, add most/all of remaining water, a
little at a time, until dough is the right consistency or just a slight bit
too soft.  Mix 2-3 more minutes at medium speed to develop gluten.  Add
seeds; mix at low speed to incorporate, about a minute or two.  Turn out on
to lightly floured work surface.  Knead by hand for a minute or two, mostly
to feel that the dough is right (add a bit more flour, if needed) and to
form a loose ball.

Usual rising and proofing rules:  Initial rise in lightly oiled bowl,
covered, until doubled (you can actually do this two or even three
times).  Punch down.  Divide into one and one-half pound pieces
(approx.).  You then want to form log-shaped loaves about 8 or so inches
long.

(Shaping is the hardest thing for me to do, let alone explain, so just make
your loaves about half the height and width and 2/3 the length you hope to
end up with, by folded letter or rolled out ball methods or whatever works
for you, doing your best to end up with a well sealed seam and nicely
rounded ends.  Many bread baking books have helpful pictures that try to
show you what to do.  There is no substitute for repeated experience,
however).

Lay out each loaf, seam side down, on parchment paper-covered baking
sheets, lightly sprinkled with polenta or coarse-ground corn meal.  Preheat
oven at this point to 375F.

Allow loaves to rise, covered, for an hour or so, until nearly
doubled.  Brush loaves with egg wash mixture (1 large egg + 2T water).
Slash tops of loaves near each end and in the middle, perpendicular to
length of loaf, with lame or extremely sharp knife, and immediately put
trays in oven.  (For crisper, chewier crust, increase initial oven temp to
425F; spray oven with water right before trays go in, when they go in,
after two minutes, after four minutes and after another minute, reducing
temp to 375F after initial five minutes or when loaves first start to show
color).  Bake for 15-17 minutes, turn trays to avoid uneven baking, then
bake for another 15-17 minutes until loaves are deeply browned.  They are
ready, as so many baker/authors explain, when a tap on the bottom yields a
hollow sound and a thermometer inserted into the middle of the loaf shows
an internal temp of 190F or better.  Cool on racks for at least 45 minutes
before trying to slice.

Notes
#1:  Starter is a challenge all by itself.  You can start from scratch by
combining a few ounces of water and an equal weight of light rye flour and
let it sit out uncovered for a few days in the hope that enough wild yeast
will populate the mixture to begin the fermentation process.  If it takes,
you add more flour and water (again in equal proportions) to build the
starter, and continue to do so over several days (always doubling the
amounts or dumping half or more of the earlier quantity), until you end up
with a starter that rises and bubbles up well within 4-6 hours after a
feeding.  There is no need to use anything but flour and water.  Some
purists rail against any added ingredients.  Others suggest a start with a
pinch of domesticated yeast to get the ball rolling. I figure the
saccharomyces will eventually give way to the wild stuff after a while
anyway.  Then there is the Nancy Silverton ("Breads From The La Brea
Bakery") method, with the grapes.  Very elaborate and ritualized.  Hey,
whatever works to ferment your flour.

As an alternative to starting from scratch, you can take an established
white starter and convert it to rye, i.e. start feeding with rye instead of
white flour over a period of several days, until the rye is
predominant.  If you feed and dump, eventually all the white stuff will
disappear, leaving a pure rye culture.

If your starter is very active, use the lesser amount of yeast mentioned in
the recipe (or even a little less); the more active the starter, the
greater the leavening power it has in the preferment.

#2:  You want to use a high protein bread flour (plain bread flour, with an
ounce or so per pound of wheat gluten added, will do nicely) because an
enzyme in the onions tends to break down the gluten too much
otherwise.  Also, the rye flour in the recipe has very little or no gluten
forming capacity.  What happens to your beautifully formed loaves when the
gluten decays excessively during the proof stage is not very
attractive.  Trust me.  I know my friend George Greenstein ("Secrets Of A
Jewish Baker") says to use "first clear flour."  George even sent me some,
and it is good stuff (if you can find it).  It is not, however, high in
protein.  So use it in other rye bread recipes, but not if you are going to
use onions.

#3:  Available from Bob's Red Mill.  Use meal if possible because it gives
the bread a nice texture.  If you must, you can go with a course rye flour
as an alternative.

#4:  Two to three medium yellow onions, chopped into about an 1/8" to 1/4"
dice, mixed well with 2-3T olive oil, should be spread on a baking tray and
placed into a 400F oven.  After 20 minutes, you want to pull the tray, move
the onion together into a pile, turn and re-spread them.  Roast for another
15 minutes at 350F.  Go through the same process again, and turn oven down
to 250F for another 20-30 minutes.  The goal here is to get your onions
well carmelized and cooked-down to 1/4 or less of their original volume.  I
suppose you could use dehydrated onions and save the work, but I never
have.  The total amount of onion you use in this recipe is a matter of
taste.  Roasted onions should be totally cooled before adding to other
ingredients.

#5:  Spelling of the word varies.  Available from Penzey's or locally (in
Portland) from Oregon Spice Co.  Good luck trying to find it at any grocery
store.  Also known as black caraway, nigella or nigella sativa seeds.  Not
to be confused with black onion seeds which are a totally different
creature.  Chernushka seeds are small and roundish with a distinctive smoky
flavor.  A good rye should not omit them.

Other Comments:

Don't waste your time or money on rye bread or pumpernickel mixes or other
overpriced crap.  If you want a dark rye, add a few grams of cocoa powder,
molasses, instant coffee powder or black shoe polish--or a little of each
(just kidding about the shoe polish).  If you can find it, liquid or
crystal caramel coloring ought to do the trick as an alternative.  In my
opinion, there is no real difference between light and dark rye--the latter
has just been colored.  Although I don't have the facts on this, my theory
is that dark rye was created by some old Russian for the sole purpose of
hiding the arguably unattractive grayish color of natural rye.

A word on "sour" taste.  A good bread which uses sour dough starter should
be slightly tangy, not intensely sour.  This rye recipe will have that
tangy characteristic (which the caraway tends to emphasize).  Any mature
starter used in a slowly fermented dough will add this
quality.  Personally, the thought of adding souring agents to any bread is
abhorrent (and will throw off the pH balance of the dough).  Those who
think that real sourdough must be really sour (think factory made San
Francisco "Sour") have fallen prey to such additives.  If you think I am
making this up, check the ingredients; you will invariably find fumaric or
tartaric acid or some such thing on the list. Yuck.

E-mail me if you have any questions.

  1              small  chopped sweet onion
                        olive or canola oil
                        -- or bacon fat

Onion Scones -- Wilt 1 chopped smallish onion (Vidalia, for sweet flavor)
in a pan with a little olive oil or canola oil (healthy version) or bacon
fat (traditional version) until transparent but not brown. Cool.  Add most
of it to the dough for Sweet Milk Scones before rolling it out, but for
extra flavor reserve a bit of cooked onion to put on top of each scone
(after brushing scone with a beaten egg) before baking.


Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

Place wedges 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 400F for 12-16 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 1 minute.

Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine powdered sugar and enough orange juice for desired drizzling consistency; blend until smooth. Drizzle mixture over top and sides of each scone. Cool 5 minutes. If desired, split each scone and spread with 2 teaspoons preserves, or serve preserves n the side. Serve warm.

Makes 8 scones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4      teaspoons  yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  shortening
  3               cups  flour -- all-purpose

NOTES : Wanted to share another bread bowl recipe that I got from one of those small cookbooks you pickup at the checkout counter in the grocery store. These are very light and take no time to mix up. I make them ahead of time and them stack them between sheets of wax paper and put them in a zip-lock bag and freeze. Can take them out as you need them. Great with chili or beef stew.

                        Percentage Of Ingredients

Recipe By     :Maggie Glezer <glezer@mindspring.com>

                        *****

Many trained bakers use an entirely different system to talk about
their ingredients called baker's percentage.  Bakers, of course, weigh
all  ingredients, so this system can really only be used with
ingredients  expressed by weight.  With it, you can convert any recipe
easily into any  desired yield, and compare recipes quickly on an
apples-to-apples  basis.  It is also the best tool to formulate bread recipes.

It works by expressing all ingredients as a ratio of the total flour
weight.  Thus, if a recipe uses 1000 g flour, 700 g water, 20 g yeast
and  20 g salt, the baker's percentages would be 100% flour, 70% water,
2%  yeast, and 2% salt.

If several different flours are used, their total should add up to
100%. Thus, if a recipe used 1.6 oz whole-rye flour, 6.4 oz whole-wheat
flour and  8 oz white flour, the baker's percentage would read 10%
whole-rye flour,  40% whole-wheat flour, and 50% white flour.

For example, if the total flour weighs 16 ounces:
       1.6 / 16 = 0.1 = 10%;
       6.4 / 16 = 0.4 = 40%;
       8 / 16 = 0.5 = 50%.

[Editor's Note: Maggie's new book should be coming out next fall, and is
currently titled Artisan Baking Across America. Artisan Publishing is
the  publisher.  This book, by the way, is not at all technical, but much
more  of a cook book and coffee-table travelogue ... Reggie]

                     Pita Bread In The Food Processor

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour -- approximately *
  2                tsp  salt
  1               tbsp  sugar
  1                pkg  dry yeast
                        -- (2 tsp instant)
  2               tbsp  oil -- olive oil preferred
  1               cups  hot water -- 120-130 degrees
                        Eight 7" squares of aluminum foil
                        -- (I used baking sheets)

Makes eight 6" pitas; 3.5 grams of fat each

*   (used 1/2 KA Special for Machines and 1/2 KA white whole wheat)

Attach the steel blade. Place 1 cup flour and the other dry ingredients in the work bowl. Pulse once or twice to blend the ingredients. Mix the oil with the hot water and pour through the feed tube. Process for 15 seconds. Remove the cover and add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough forms a ball and rides the blade.

With the processor on, knead for 45 seconds. The dough should be soft and perhaps slightly sticky. Use sprinkles of flour to control stickiness. Turn from the bowl and knead by hand for a moment or two to be certain the dough is of the right consistency.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll into balls, cover with a towel or wax paper, and let rest for 20 minutes. (Dough got dry under a towel; when the pitas puffed in the oven, the dry side was thinner than the moist side)

With the palm of your hand flatten each ball into a disk. Finish with a rolling pin, flattening the dough into a disk about 6" in diameter and 3/16" thick. (Can have them 6" in diameter OR 3/16" thick; mine were much thinner) Their thinness is more important than making them perfectly round. Irregularity adds charm.

Place each round on a prepared piece of foil. Placing the rounds on the foil rather than on a baking sheet or stone allows a softer heat to surround the dough. A direct thrust of heat from a baking sheet would form a crust difficult to puff. (Used baking sheets)

Carefully place 2 or 3 of the breads directly on the oven shelf. Bake for about 8 minutes (only 5 minutes), or until they are puffed. Repeat with the remaining disks. Place the pitas under the broiler for 2 minutes if browner crusts are desired. (The pitas were very brown on the top when baked in the middle of the oven)

Remove breads from the oven and wrap in a large piece of foil. (Towel) The tops will fall and there will be a pocket in the center. Serve warm or let cool and freeze. Thaw before using. To reheat, stack several in a pile, wrap with foil, and place in a 375-degree oven for 10-15 minutes.

  1 1/2           cups  Semolina Flour

This is our favorite pizza dough - it comes crisp on the bottom, but chewy
inside.  I found this recipe in a Yankee Magazine some time back:

Add to bread machine and process for dough.  If making by hand, dissolve
yeast and sugar in water, add 1 c flour, salt and oil, then add
semolina.  Knead in remaining flour till smooth and elastic.  Place in
greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise till double.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge:
  2 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Dough:
     3/4           cup  milk -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        All of the sponge
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sea salt

To make the sponge: In a large bowl, mix the yeast and the flour. Pour in the water and stir with a wooden spoon until you have a batter-like dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes.

To make the dough: Beat the milk and olive oil into the sponge with a wooden spoon. Stir in the flour and salt, mixing to make a dough. Knead on a lightly floured work surface for 8 to 10 minutes until the dough is velvety and sticky.

First rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425F with a baking stone inside. Second rise: Generously oil an 11 X 17-inch baking pan. Place the dough in the pan, press it as far toward the edges as it will go, and cover with a towel. After 10 minutes, stretch it again to the edges, cover, and let it rise for 20 more minutes.

Topping: Use the toppings of your choice, distributing them evenly over the surface
Baking: Set the baking pan directly on the stone and bake until the crust is crispy and crunchy, about 22 to 30 minutes.

Note: This recipe is adapted from Carol Field's book "In Nonna's Kitchen." There it is called sfincione or Sicilian focaccia.

I also added 1/4 cup dried potato flakes, as the commercial bread listed
potato flour in their ingredient list.
I also added 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract (Nielsen-Massey Madagascar
Bourbon Vanilla).

Baked the two round loaves in 9-inch cake pans at 350F for almost an hour.
Will tent with foil next time, as it got a wee bit too brown in my
convection oven, and will bake for a whisker less time next time.  This
produced a very tasty loaf that I would make again, but it still seems to
have "something" missing.

                        unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        -- used sea salt
  1                cup  milk
                        -- used 2%
  3              large  eggs
                        -- used fresh local eggs
  4             ounces  butter
     1/4           cup  dried potato flakes
  2                tsp  vanilla extract

I also added 1/4 cup dried potato flakes, as the commercial bread listed potato flour in their ingredient list.
I also added 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract (Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla).

Baked the two round loaves in 9-inch cake pans at 350 for almost an hour. Will tent with foil next time, as it got a wee bit too brown in my convection oven, and will bake for a whisker less time next time. This produced a very tasty loaf that I would make again, but it still seems to have "something" missing.

If there are any suggestions that you could make, to make this more authentic and perhaps find the elusive "something" - - - - please advise. Is this pretty authentic as far as Portuguese Sweet Bread recipes go? Could you please check this out for me? (I only got two replies on the digest in response to my query, perhaps due to the timing, around Christmas.)

NOTES : I've been tweaking a recipe that was posted for me in the bread bakers digest for the Portuguese Sweet Bread, in order to try to duplicate the taste of King's Hawaiian Bread. I picked up a loaf at the grocery store to look at the ingredient list for clues, and was quickly reminded of why I have this quest to replicate it at home, and returned it to the shelf. Lots of multisyllabic chemicals and additives. I'm not interested in a mix, for similar reasons, as well as freshness and quality. If you're not familiar with this product, you might look up their website at www.kingshawaiian.com
though, of course, they probably don't list the ingredients there.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  plain mashed potatoes
                        -- (instant flakes and water are fine)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1            package  yeast -- (2 1/4 teaspoons)
     1/2           cup  hot water
  4               cups  bread or all-purpose flour -- approximately (4 to
                        -- 5)
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick) room
                        temperature
                        ---
                        baking pans
                        -- 2 medium (8" x 4") pans -- greased or telflon

in large mixing or mixer bowl, combine the potatoes, eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, yeast, warm water & 2 cups of flour. Stir into a rough batter.Kneading will come later

cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap & set aside until the batter doubles in volume, 1 1/2 hours
meanwhile, cream the butter with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar. set aside.

remove the plastic wrap & beat down the batter, stir in the creamed butter & sugar, Add the balance of the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, using a wooden spoon or a mixer flat beater, When the batter gets heavy, replace the beater with a dough hook. the dough will be a rough shaggy mass that will clean the sides of the bowl. if the dough continues to be moist & sticky, sprinkle with small amounts of dough

If by hand (kneading) turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface & knead with a rhythmic motion of push-turn-fold. If using a mixer, knead with the dough hook (and add flour if necessary) until the dough cleans the sides of bowl. the dough will form a soft ball around the hook as it turns. Knead for 10 minutes. the dough will be smooth &elastic when stretched between hands.

Place the dough in a mixing bowl & pat with buttered or greased fingers. cover the bowl with plastic wrap & leave until dough has risen to about twice its original volume, about 1 1/2 hours. You can test if it has risen by poking a finger into it; the dent will remain if it is ready.

Punch down dough, turn it onto the worksurface again & knead for 30 seconds to press out the bubbles. with a sharp knife, divide the dough in half. shape into balls. Let rest under a towel for 3 to 4 minutes Form the loaves by pressing each ball into a flat oval, roughly the length of the bread pan. fold the oval in half, pinch the seam tightly to seal, tuck under the ends and place in pan, seam side down.

Place the loaves in a warm place, cover with wax or parchment paper & let rise to
double in volume, above the edge of the pan, 40 minutes

preheat the oven to 375 degrees 20 minutes before baking

Bake the loaves until they are a golden brown, about 40 minutes. turn one loaf out of its pan & tap bottom crust with a forefinger. a hard hollow sound means the bread is baked. If not return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. If tops of the loaves appear to be browing too quickly, cover with a piece of foil or brown sack paper. Midway during baking& again near the end of it, shift the pans so the loaves are exposed equally to temperature variations in the oven.
If using a convection oven, reduce heat 50 degrees.

Remove the bread from the oven. turn from pans & place on a metal rack to cool before slicing.
this loaf will keep well for several days at room temperature. It will keep for 4 to 5 months at 0 (zero) degrees in the freezer. It makes fine toast.

NOTES :
But since it' s Saint Patrick's Day this week, I thought I'd post my favorite potato bread recipe. I will tell you know that I load it in the Zo to mix (using cold water & 4 1/2 cups of flour) & it rises higher & better than the rise I get from the Kitchen Aid & kneading it & despite the instructions in the recipe that follows, I do put it all in the Zo at the same time but take it out & finish in the oven - it also makes wonderful rolls....

this is from Bernard Clayton's "Complete Book of Breads", copyright 1987, page
399 "Sister Jennie's Potato Bread" Mr Clayton's info about each bread is fascinating, but I'm just going to do the recipe...

                Hand Made                       Sourdough Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Prepare sourdough:
  8               cups  all purpose white bread flour
  5               tbsp  dry yeast
  1                tsp  brown sugar
  4               cups  warm water
                        Make dough
  20              cups  white bread flour
  5               tbsp  active dry yeast
  1               tsp.  Brown sugar
     1/3           cup  milk -- warm
     1/2           cup  salt
  1 1/2           cups  mashed potatoes -- room temperature
  2               cups  warm water
                        -- (saved from boiling the mashed potatoes
                        if possible)
  1               tsp.  Garlic powder
                        -- (or 2 tsp. crushed fresh garlic)
     1/2           cup  starter from last time -- if available
  1                     egg white for glaze

Prepare sourdough:

Mix flour with warm water in a LARGE (note ingredient quantities will at least double) bowl. Dissolve yeast and sugar in 3 Tbsp additional warm water in a small warm bowl for 10 minutes; combine and work with the sponge in the large bowl until it becomes very smooth and soft-textured. (This is much akin to the traditional 120 strokes; if beating it with a wooden spoon is too much, use wet hands to lift and stretch the sour in the bowl to develop the gluten). Cover the bowl with heavy cloth (or plastic wrap!) and place in a warm place for 8-10 hours (overnight is fine). It will smell sour and should have dropped - the sponge will rise first to its fullest, and fall back. Don't let a dry crust form on top. If a hard crust forms, soak it with a little warm milk and scrap it from the sides of the bowl.

Make dough
Again, dissolve yeast and sugar in three Tbsp of warm water in small warm bowl for 10 minutes. Mix the mashed potatoes with the starter from last time (Frank recommends drying the starter and this will reconstitute; I confess I keep mine wet in the refrigerator.) Add milk and combine will in a mid-sized bowl. Add to first sponge in the large bowl until it is soft and smooth and has a consistency similar to the first sponge. Add all flour and garlic (or sub 1 tsp. powdered caraway seeds) to the dough. Dissolve the salt into the warm water and mix it with the rest of the ingredients in the large bowl. Work it over really well, till dough is firm and free from dry flour patches.

Add more warm water if it's needed for mixing, but dough should not be wet-looking. (It is, however, quite slack!) Sprinkle flour on the dough and cover bowl with damp cloth and place it back to a warm place to rise, about 1 hour.

Uncover the bowl and punch dough down. Work dough over with a wet hand for a few minutes, then sprinkle it with flour again. Cover bowl and place it back in a warm place for 1 hour longer to rise again.

Portion & knead

Take the dough from the large bowl, place it on the counter-top sprinkled lightly with flour. Save 1/2 cup and store in a small bowl (I use a tightly-covered container, refrigerated) for the next batch; divide remaining into six portions. (Now Frank sez this makes 6 18x10x7 cm pans; I translate that to our standard 6x3x2" and it's at least 12 loaves of that size in my experience. Remember how much flour you put into this already!!)

Knead each piece and then roll it out with the rolling pin to about 1/2 inch thick. Roll up dough, press ends & bottom seam to seal. (Keep the dough as slack as you can and still handle it; the wonderful texture comes from a pretty "wet" dough.) Place dough in greased pan; repeat until all dough is kneaded and shaped. Cover pans with damp cloth and let rise. (This is lovely as rolls or in baguette shapes as well, and no doubt would bake up nicely in a free-form loaf if you like that approach.)

Bake

Preheat oven to 375*. Beat egg white with 4 Tbsp water in a small bowl. Slash tops of loaves about 1/2" deep, or poke holes with a skewer or ice pick all the way to the bottom lengthwise down the center. Brush thinly with the egg white mixture and place into preheated oven. Place on the bottom of the oven a pie pan filled with 1 cup boiling water (or drop a dozen ice cubes into a hot pan previously placed on the oven floor - be careful of steam either way.) Bake 35 minutes; brush with egg white and remove steam source.

Reduce heat to 325*; bake for 45-50minutes longer, until light brown in color. Test for doneness by rapping bottom of loaves; if not yet done, re-place in oven upside down in the pan to assist bottom in baking. (Sometimes this bread takes much longer to bake fully ... the slacker the dough to begin with, the longer to bake and brown. The egg white helps the browning and produces a beautiful glaze, but you can leave it out and still get fine bread.) Remove from pans and place on a rack; brush again with egg white mixture while still very hot. Cool before slicing. Frank: "Now you can enjoy a real European bread." Carolyn: and enjoy and enjoy! Fabulous toasted and for sandwiches. Be careful, it's even better with butter.

NOTES : Says Frank: I am making this bread in the old fashion way for years. My father was a master baker in Hungary. He give me his secret, how to make this potato, sour, crusty bread, that stays fresh for many days! My family and friends just loves it. It was a little hard to find the right flour. Now it is available.

Says Carolyn: I have translated into US measurements from metric, and added some clarity where I found the original instructions a little sparse. It's grand bread, makes a ton, have extra pans handy! NB: the yeast and salt measurements are NOT typos! Frank wisely suggests that you check how many pans will fit into your oven BEFORE you start the recipe.

* or extra to make a soft, smooth ball of dough after the first 5-7 minutes of kneading

Place all the ingredients except the egg white and seeds in the bread machine and program for DOUGH using the Whole Wheat Setting if available. Watch the dough forming during the first few minutes of the kneading cycle, adding additional water or white flour as needed to form a smooth , supple ball. At the end of the final cycle, punch down the dough, dust it lightly with flour and place it in a large freezer strength zip lock bag. refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

In the food processor: Place the dry ingredients and the altus in the work bowl, process for 10 seconds to combine the ingredients, then with the machine running, slowly pour in the liquid. Process until a sticky ball forms, then process for an additional 45 seconds, adding additional liquid if necessary. Allow the dough to rest in the work bowl for 15 minutes, then process for another 45 seconds.

In the stand mixer fitted with the dough hook: dissolve the yeast in the water and molasses. Add the dry ingredients and altus to the mixing bowl and mix on low speed to combine. Add the liquid and knead on low speed for 2 minutes, then on medium speed for 5-7 minutes, adding more liquid if necessary to make a sticky ball of dough. Rise in a oiled, covered bowl set in a warm place, then proceed as below.

Sprinkle a heavy duty baking sheet with cornmeal. Form the dough into a round loaf, cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 350 with the rack in the center position. Glaze with the egg wash and sprinkle with the seeds. Bake for 30-45 minutes or the bread has an internal temperature of 190 - 200. Cool completely before slicing.

NOTES :
Like all hearty dark grain loaves, pumpernickel bread is best not overrisen.
 This version is dense and moist and makes a compact, finely textured loaf. The flavor and texture are developed with multiple kneads and a long, slow cool rise before the bread is shaped for the final rise and baking. Don't be tempted to rush the process or you'll end up with a brick. Pumpernickel flour is a medium grind rye flour which contains almost no gluten and will not rise unless combined with other flour (such as white). The traditionally added black caraway is available in specialty food stores and by mail order from King Arthur.

Altus is a mash made by soaking small pieces of stale rye bread in water overnight in the refrigerator and then squeezing out the excess liquid.

Whenever I visited NY I always went to this one restaurant and ate there Pumpernickel rolls. I loved them, only place I have ever seen  them.  I spent years trying to duplicate them.  This is pretty close.  You  can leave it in the machine and make a loaf of bread out of it.  But I like  the rolls much better.

This is one of my favorite recipes. You can either make rolls or just leave the dough in the ABM to make a loaf of bread. It must be started the  night before.  This gives you the real sourdough flavor with all the  trouble of keeping a pumpernickel sourdough starter.

Add the starter ingredients to the ABM and let knead for about 10 minutes. Reset the machine (turn it off) and leave the pan in the machine overnight  or 6-8 hours.

Add remaining ingredients and start machine as usual. If making the loaf in the Machine use the specialty bread setting and add the raisins at the  beep. (If you add them to early they get ground up)

If you are going to make rolls use the dough setting. The raisins are very good in the rolls. Using the dough setting on my Hitachi I added them  at the 1:18 mark, on the Breadman at the 1:05 mark. When the dough is  ready,  roll out into a flat square. Form into balls the size of a large  Lemon. Press down and cover.  Let rise until doubled (1 hour) then cook 20  minutes at 350F.

Makes about 15 rolls.

  3              parts  flour
  1               part  liquid
  1         tablespoon  yeast -- scant

I double checked with my King Arthur 200 Year Anniversary cookbook, and found the following (this is a direct quote for you):

"The key to being an intuitive baker lies in knowing what the key ingredients are in whatever you're baking, and the ratio they have to each other. In yeast baking, there are just the three alluded to above: the flour, the liquid, and the yeast. In most breads you'll use three parts of flour to one of liquid, by volume, not weight. Our recipe for hearth bread, which will make two loaves, callls for two cups of water and three times that, or six cups, of flour. For this much flour and water, we'll use 1 packet, or a scant tablespoon of yeast."

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              cups.  all purpose flour
  4               tsp.  baking powder
     1/2         cups.  sugar
  1               tsp.  salt
  1              stick  butter
                        -- (use the real thing, preferably
                        unsalted)
  1                     egg -- beaten with
                        -- enough milk to make 1 cup
                        More sugar

Mix the dry ingredients. Cut in the butter. Add the liquid to make a soft dough. Form into 6 (humongous) or 8 (somewhat more reasonable sized) shortcakes. Sprinkle tops heavily with sugar. Bake on a greased cookie sheet in 400 - 425 oven for 15-17 minutes, until tops are light golden.

Now, this makes GREAT strawberry shortcake, especially the old-fashioned style where you pour the unwhipped cream over the berries and the shortcake. But be sure to make enough for leftovers, because what you REALLY want to do is split them horizontally the next morning, toast them lightly, and spread them with strawberry jam. I know, they are kind of crumbly, and they make a mess in the toaster (opt for the toaster oven if you can), but believe me, it's worth it.

And when strawberries go out of season, there are always peaches....

                        *****

In response to Barbara Moore who wanted to know about using a microwave for bread rising--I tried this method many years ago when I first got my microwave and it works very well. Here is the method from my cookbook (mine is a 750 watt oven so you may need to make adjustments based on the size of yours). Put 1 cup of water in a 2-cup glass measure and place it in the oven. Bring the water to a boil on HI, about 3-3 1/2 minutes. Place the dough in the oven next to the water (dough must be in a glass or plastic bowl, of course). Set the oven at the lowest possible setting and the timer for 10 min. When the timer beeps leave the dough in the oven for another 20 min. or until double. You can then form it into loaves, again using only non-metal pans, and repeat the above directions for rising in the pans. I used this method quite a bit when I first discovered it but stopped because I thought I might wear out my microwave before its time (I bake a lot of bread and figured I was subjecting the oven to a lot of "run" time). I didn't encounter any problems with the final product after using this method and it's a handy thing to know if you need bread in a hurry occasionally.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  instant active dry yeast
  3               cups  all purpose unbleached white flour
  1         tablespoon  Lora Brody's Bread Dough Enhancer
  3        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
     1/3           cup  corn meal
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  butter -- softened
  1                     egg
     1/3           cup  Roquefort cheese -- crumbled
  1                cup  water -- *
  1                cup  toasted walnuts

* plus additional water if necessary to make a smooth, supple ball of dough after the first five minutes of kneading

Bread Machine:
Place all the ingredients in the bread machine and program for DOUGH. Check the dough after the first five minutes of the first knead cycle, adding more liquid if necessary to form a smooth, supple ball. Add the walnuts at the very end of the final knead cycle, or knead them in by hand. At the end of the final cycle punch down the dough and place it in a large heavy duty plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Food Processor: Place all the dry ingredients including the yeast in the food processor fitted with the plastic blade. Process just to combine. Add the butter, egg and cheese. Process 10 seconds just to combine. With the machine running, add the water through the feed tube and process until a ball forms. Process for an additional 40 seconds. Allow the dough to rise in the food processor until double in bulk. Remove the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead in the walnuts, then place the dough in a large heavy duty plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Stand Mixer:
Place the dry ingredients in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the kneading blade. Mix on low to combine, then with the mixer off add the butter, egg and cheese. Mix to combine. With the mixer on low speed dribble in the water until a soft, sticky ball forms. Knead on medium speed for 10 minutes.
 Cover and allow to rise at room temperature until double in bulk. Punch down the dough, knead 5 more minutes adding the walnuts at the very end. Remove the dough to a large heavy duty plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

To form the bread: Generously butter an 8 cup loaf pan or 2 baguette pans or a 12 hole muffin tin. On a lightly floured work surface gently form the dough to fit the selected pan (s). Cover and allow the dough to rise in a warm place until it is barely doubled in bulk. Bake in the center rack of a pre-heated 375 oven. About 40 minutes for the large loaf, 20 minutes for the baguettes and 15- 17 minutes for the rolls. The internal temperature of the breads should be 190 - 200 on an instant read thermometer.

NOTES : Dense and rich and wonderfully aromatic, this bread keeps especially well because of high fat content. The Roquefort flavor is subtle enough that it is difficult to identify. People who claim to dislike blue cheeses love this and don't know what they are savoring. Any good quality blue cheese can be substituted for the Roquefort. The following recipe can be made into one large loaf, 2 baguettes or 12 dinner rolls.

Besides the intended use of opening recalcitrant jars, a rubber jar opener mat can be used for several other helpful tasks:

When mixing by hand, place a rubber jar opener mat under a mixing bowl to keep the bowl from moving.

Place one under a cutting board to stabilize it when chopping ingredients. Use two mats, spaced evenly apart, under larger cutting boards, such as when rolling out dough or pastry.

Roll the mat up to form a tube around garlic cloves. Roll gently back and forth over the countertop to easily remove the skin.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           packages  active dry yeast
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        -- (100-115F -- approximately)
     1/2           cup  lukewarm milk
  1              stick  butter -- melted in the milk
  1                tsp  salt
  3                     eggs
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (3 1/2 to 4)

MIXING: Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a mixing bowl, and allow to proof. Add the milk, butter, and salt, and stir well to combine. Add the eggs and incorporate them well with a wooden spoon. Then add the flour in small amounts, and beat well with a wooden spoon after each addition. Make a stiff but workable batter, using up to four cups of flour if necessary.

FIRST RISE: Cover the bowl, and let the batter rise slowly in a rather cool spot until doubled in bulk. Beat it down with a wooden spoon for about 1 minutes. Scrape into a well-buttered 9 or 10 inch tube pan.

SECOND RISE: Let the batter rise-this time to the very top of the pan.

BAKING: Bake in a preheated 375F oven 45 to 50 minutes or until the bread is dark and golden on top [and internal temperature reaches 190F on and instant-read thermometer, jtr]. Turn out on a rack to cool, or serve warm, if you prefer, with sweet butter.

YIELD: 1 ring loaf

NOTES : "This is an old, old recipe for Sally Lunn. I like to bake it in a large tube pan and invert it. It makes a beautiful standing loaf that, when fresh, should be torn apart with forks rather than cutting, to retain its lightness. Or, after cooling, it can be sliced and toasted. If you have some left, I recommend that you freeze it and use it sliced and toasted." (James Beard)

  3              large  or 4 small eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  shortening -- and
     1/2           cup  butter
                        -- (mixed and melted but NOT BUBBLY )
  1                cup  tepid milk

  2                tsp  salt

                        -- (or scant 1 Tbsp)
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water

METHOD: Preheat oven to 325F during SECOND RISE

Beat eggs separately. Place egg yolks into large mixing bowl or Electric Mixer. Beat egg whites in a small bowl until stiff but not dry. In another mixing bowl add sugar and salt to flour. Set aside.

MIXING, BEATING AND FIRST RISE: Melt shortening and butter together, cool slightly, and pour into egg yolks. Add warm milk, yeast, flour mixture and stiffly beaten egg whites. Beat thoroughly, brush with melted butter, cover with wax paper and towel; set aside in warm place until it rises to double in size. About 3 hours.

SECOND BEATING AND SECOND RISE: Beat by hand about 5 minutes. (Don't cheat). (If using Electric Mixer, use paddle and beat about 3 minutes on speed TWO). Pour into greased funnel cake pan and, cover with greased wax paper and a clean towel; let rise again (1 1/2 to 2 hours).

Bake in moderate oven about 45 minutes.. Start oven at 325F. When half done (22 minutes) INCREASE to 375F. Serve with lots of butter.

NOTES:
This dough is really a batter, too thin to knead. Nonetheless, it should be much thicker than cake batter. If more than 4 cups flour is required, add another cup slowly after all other ingredients have been incorporated. Blend well. I have found, after years of preparing this bread by hand, that my KitchenAid works just fine, just shorten the SECOND BEATING time to about 3 minutes. (Joni Repasch)

NOTES : This recipe is the one I have used for years and is so very much like the one my grandmother (Mary Thompson) used to prepare. Like your mother-in-law, Mrs. Thompson was not noted for her cooking talents, but when it came to Sally Lunn and Fried Red Tomatoes, nothing could touch her recipes and methods. As stated in my notes at bottom of this second recipe, my KitchenAid does a great job of mixing and beating the dough.

NOTES : A very rich, European tasting bread. The eggs give it lots of terrific taste and color. Tradition says that a young Englishwoman, Sally Lunn, sold this bread on the streets of Bath. Most bread cookbooks contain a version of this, which attests to its wonderful flavor. This is one of those breads which will never last to see leftovers. Note that this is a very high rising loaf. Use less yeast than normal and do not decrease salt amount.

                        *****

Here is a recipe from The Grand Union Cook Book (Grand Union Tea Company) Compiled by Margaret Compton. Published 1902.

I have typed it exactly as it appears in the book. Many of the recipes in this book fail to mention how much time to bake or cook a recipe.

This delicious tea cake may be made either with yeast or with baking powder. It must be mixed as carefully as any delicate cake. When yeast is used, only a very little is required; for a quart of flour not more than one-quarter of a small cake (of yeast) would be needed. The dough is also made short, two ounces of butter being rubbed into a quart of flour. Three large or four small eggs must be well beaten, whites and yolks separately and added to the sponge, which must stand for an hour, and then molded quickly and baked in a very hot oven.
Sally Lunns are always spritzen and butter lavishly before being sent to the table.

When made with baking powder three teaspoonfuls are required for a quart and the other proportions remain the same. A tablespoonful of sugar may be added if a sweet cake is preferred.

Pour both of these liquids into the flour and add 2 eggs. Mix to a smooth dough and kneed (really!) well or mix thoroughly in a food processor. Leave in a warm place to rise until it doubles in size. Turn onto a floured board and kneed (again!) lightly. Divide into 5 or 6 pieces and let rise again on a baking tray in a warm place. Bake on the baking tray for 8-9 minutes at 420F to a golden colour.

Cut in generous slices and serve toasted with soft butter, strawberry jam and clotted cream.

My note: I can't personally see the difference if you dissolve 1 teaspoon regular white granulated sugar in place of the caster sugar, but I have given you the exact recipe. Caster sugar is like berry sugar or super-fine sugar, but not icing (confectioners') sugar. If you can't locate it, whir some sugar in a blender for a few seconds.

NOTES : ...is a closely guarded secret, but here is the one that Sally Lunn's House in Bath, England, hands out as an "alternative traditional" recipe. This elegant tea-room is in Bath's oldest surviving house. Sally Lunn established a bakery there in the 1680s.

When we visited Bath (also the home of Bath buns, but that's another story), I treated my husband to a Sally Lunn tea at the tea-room (the only way I could entice him to enter this charming spot which he felt wasn't a guy kind of place. But that's another story, too). The price was *shocking* but then, that's what holidays are for. The recipe doesn't state how to form the buns, but the ones we had were round and about 6 inches across with a smooth, dark top. I would say they had been baked in baking tins with about a 2" lip, not free form on a tray despite the recipe they hand out. The recipe is in metric. This is exactly as it is written:

(Originally published in the Bread Bakers Guild of America Newsletter)

Salt is such a minor ingredient in bread that few bakers stop to think about its exact role in bread-making. However, sometimes focusing a light on a seemingly unimportant aspect of bread-making can illuminate the whole bread-making process. Such is the case with salt. Salt exerts an influence on almost every stage of bread-making, and every aspect of bread. Why is salt one of bread's cornerstones? What importance does it have beyond being a flavoring element? This article will attempt to explain and clarify some of the chemistry governing salt's interactions with bread dough.

Salt's primary purpose in bread is to evoke and enhance the bread's flavor. To most Americans, saltless bread is insipid and virtually inedible, but adding only approximately 2% of the flour weight in salt to the average bread formula manifestly changes the perception of bread's flavor, eliciting the full spectrum of complex flavor notes, including a sweetness that would be otherwise absent. It is interesting that the addition of salt to bread is a relatively new preference. Medieval bread was almost never salted because salt was very expensive and difficult to procure; thus, salt-less bread was preferred. According to Professor Raymond Calvel, professor emeritus of l'Ecole Francaise de Meunerie, French bread formulas started to include salt only at the end of the eighteenth century.

Besides flavoring the bread, bakers have long noted salt's alteration of certain dough characteristics. Unsalted dough mixes faster, has little resistance to extension and feels sticky. Bakers who delay the salt addition during mixing find that once salt is added, the dough tightens, becoming more difficult to stretch, but also becomes stronger, and is thus capable of stretching farther without ripping. (Testing by cereal scientists confirms this seemingly contradictory observation: salted doughs are both more resistant to extension and more extensible once deformed.) During fermentation, salted doughs rise more slowly, an occurrence usually solely attributed to salt's dehydrating effect on yeast. To understand how salt affects these changes, and to see if our assumptions hold true, we will need to take a look at the interactions within the dough on a molecular level.

Table salt is a type of crystal made up of chlorine and sodium ions, or charged atoms. In its crystalline state, salt's ions are positioned in a stable, geometric lattice. However, when mixed with an appropriate solvent such as water, salt dissolves, meaning that the ion lattice is forced apart by the solvent and the individual ions become enveloped by the solvent. This is exactly what occurs in a dough: crystalline salt is quickly dissolved by the dough's liquid into sodium and chloride ions.

The presence of any type of dissolved material, including ions, in the dough's liquid phase affects the function of the yeast and lactobacilli living in the dough (all doughs, not just sourdoughs, contain acidifying bacteria which contribute to the bread's flavor). In an unsalted dough, water will move freely into the yeast or bacteria cell. However, if salt is added to the dough, osmotic pressure, determined by the amount of material dissolved in the dough's liquid, will increase, drawing out some of the cell's water and thus partially dehydrating it. Higher osmotic pressure also limits the amount of fermentable sugars able to pass into the cell. These two effects--a loss of cell pressure and a decrease in sugars--combine to slow the overall rate of fermentation of both organisms. If the percentage of salt added to a dough becomes too high, excessive dehydration will eventually kill the yeast and bacteria.

Most scientists believe that at 2% of the flour weight or less, salt alone does not significantly alter either the yeast's gassing power or the bacteria's acid production. A study measuring the gas production in a fermenting dough has shown that gas production is retarded by only about 9% in a dough containing 1.5% salt (based on the flour weight).

Although salt's osmotic effect on fermentation reduction may be minor, it must be taken into consideration when attempting to maximize the build up of fermentation byproducts in pre-ferments. Thus, salt is always omitted in sponges, poolish, biga, and most other pre-ferments to ensure the greatest possible production of byproducts.

If the osmotic pressure exerted by the salt does not significantly change the fermentation rate of the dough, why does the dough rise so much more slowly when salt is added? This phenomenon can be attributed to salt's direct effect on the gluten protein network. Salt strengthens, tightens and compacts the gluten protein network, making it more resistant to pressure exerted by the build up of gaseous carbon dioxide. In salted doughs, gas production may be approximately equal to unsalted doughs, but, since the gluten protein network itself is less extensible, the dough is more resistant to the stress created by the internal gas buildup.

How does salt strengthen the gluten protein network? This is where the cereal science becomes murky. Although cereal chemists have been studying doughs for many years, there is still no real understanding of bread dough on a molecular level. Dr. O.K. Chung of the U.S.D.A. in Manhattan, Kansas, one of the leading experts on cereal lipids, has called the biochemistry of doughs "a huge puzzle," where every possible biochemical reaction is occurring at once, each one influencing the whole. In addition, every chemist has his or her own pet theories, none of which are strictly proven. So the layman must tread only where the path is well trampled.

The gluten in wheat is unique among the cereal proteins, because, when hydrated, it is capable of bonding with itself to form a viscoelastic web-like structure. "Viscoelastic" means that the web is both viscous and elastic: When a wheat dough is stretched out and released, it will either flow into a new configuration or retract back into its original shape. The gluten web can also trap and secure air bubbles, preventing them from migrating to the surface of the dough and releasing their gas. It is this last characteristic that allows a dough to be leavened by the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast.

The most widely-accepted current theory holds that the lower the dough's pH, the more positively-charged the gluten structure will be. A typical dough has a pH low enough (approximately 5) for the gluten protein to carry some positive charge. Because like charges repulse, the protein filaments in a typical dough repulse one another, resulting in a more loosely organized and less interconnected web. When salt is added to a dough, some of the negatively-charged chlorine ions will bond with the positively-charged sites on the gluten protein, neutralizing the overall charge. With the repulsive forces eliminated, the web will tighten, compact, and bond with itself more strongly. A more bonded, compact gluten web can better withstand the force exerted by the swelling air bubbles in an actively fermenting dough, and thus will expand more slowly.

Thus, while salt does slow the dough's expansion during fermentation, the long held belief that salt retards the yeast's gas production has been shown to be of only minor consequence to the fermentation rate. Instead, the primarily cause of the slow down has been shown to be a tightening of the dough's gluten structure, induced by salt's neutralization of the structure's charge. It still remains to be seen how this alteration of the dough's backbone affects its formation during mixing, or how a modification of the gluten impacts other dough constituents, especially the dough's lipids (fats) and enzymes.

Although the explanations in this article have been greatly simplified, hopefully the reader has come away with some insight into the chemistry of bread dough, and now has a heightened appreciation of the complexity surrounding even the most prosaic ingredients.

4.Kneading
5.Punching Down The Dough
 6.Letting The Dough Rest
7.Shaping The Dough
8.After Shaping
9.Determining When Baked Bread Is Done
10.Cooling

TIP #1 Proofing Yeast

If using traditional, active dry yeast, water temperature should read 105-115F/40-46C.
Stir gently a few times with spoon to dissolve. Add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of sugar.
Sprinkle yeast on top. Set aside for 10 minutes. The yeast will bubble into a foam.
If no bubbling occurs, yeast is inactive; this means you'll have to start over.


TIP #2 Mixing Techniques
By Hand
Proof the yeast and add other lukewarm liquid ingredients. Add 1 cup (250 mL) of flour and salt into wet mixture. Using a whisk or wooden spoon, mix to create a smooth, creamy batter. Add 1/2 cup (125 mL) of flour at a time. Always add flour in 1/2 cup to 1 cup (125 - 250 mL) increments. Once the flour cleans the sides of the bowl, it is ready to be kneaded.

By Electric Mixers Recommended For Bread Baking Proof the yeast.
Place all wet ingredients into mixer bowl. Never use high speeds to mix yeast doughs. Use low speed to add 1 cup (250 mL) of flour and salt to the wet mixture. Using dough hook attachment, mix for 1 minute to create smooth, creamy batter.
Continue to add flour, 1/2 cup (125 mL) at a time. Add flour slowly on the lowest speed.
The dough will form in 1 to 3 minutes of mixing slowly, working its way up the dough hook to clean sides of the bowl. At this point, you can scrape the dough from the bottom of the bowl. (Do not scrape the sides of the bowl or any of the dry bits.)


TIP #3 First Rising

Rising allows the gluten to change the dough from a firm, heavy mass to a smooth, elastic ball.
First, grease the bowl.
Lightly grease the surface of the dough to allow the gluten to stretch more easily as it swells. Cover loosely with greased waxed paper or plastic wrap and a tea towel to prevent drying out.
The dough should not rise to more than double its size. Rising temperature should be 75-85F/24-29C If temperature is too warm, it will kill the yeast; but if it's too cold, it won't rise properly.

To Determine When The Dough Has Risen Enough Press two fingers deeply into the dough and remove quickly. If the indentations remain, and the rest of the top is smooth and satiny, then the dough has risen sufficiently.
Allow more time for rising, if indentations fill.


TIP #4 Kneading

Lightly flour your hands and the work surface. Turn the dough mass onto your work surface. Gently bring the far edge of the dough forward and fold it over itself. With the heel of your hand, push the dough away from you. Give the dough a quarter turn and repeat folding and turning until it's smooth.
This can take from 4 to 10 minutes.
If the dough sticks to your hands or the surface, lightly flour them. Use the dough scraper to clean off the film of dough that accumulates on the work surface.
When adding flour during the kneading process, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) at a time onto the work surface.


TIP #5 Punching Down The Dough

Dough should be light, spongy and delicately domed after the first rising. Punch down the centre of the dough with your fist. Pull the edges of the dough to the centre and turn out of bowl onto lightly floured surface.
This step removes the large air bubbles so that the bread will be fine-textured.
If the dough is difficult to work with, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. (This will allow the gluten to relax.)
Shape dough as directed in recipe.


TIP #6 Letting The Dough Rest

After the dough has been punched down, cover with an inverted bowl and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
This will allow the dough to relax and make it easier to shape.

TIP #7 Shaping The Dough

Knead dough into a smooth, even ball.
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle approximately 9" x 12" (23 x 30 cm) to uniform thickness. Break gas bubbles as you roll.
Roll up tightly, from shorter edge, jelly roll style, sealing dough after each roll of dough with heel of hand.
Pinch the edges and ends firmly to seal. Place loaf seam side down in a well-greased loaf pan. Place loaf on greased cookie sheet; lightly flatten to form a rounded shape.

TIP #8 After Shaping

Cover loaf with tea towel.
Let dough rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size. Bake bread in preheated oven, on lower oven rack unless otherwise specified.
Arrange pans so that they do not touch each other or the sides of the oven.

TIP #9 Determining When Baked Bread Is Done

Bake to minimum time suggested in the recipe, then check for doneness. Bread loaves are done when they sound hollow when lightly tapped, and have shrunk slightly from sides of pans.
Crust colour does not indicate doneness. If excessive browning occurs before loaves sound hollow, cover with foil before they get too dark.

TIP #10 Cooling

Remove bread from pans immediately after baking. Cool on a wire rack to allow air to circulate, otherwise you'll end up with soggy bread.

  6               cups  Unsifted Flour -- approximate
                        Coarse Salt

Warm a large bowl by filling it with hot water, then pouring out water. Put the 2 cups of warm water in the bowl; sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and stir until dissolved. Add sugar, 2 tsp salt, margarine, 1 beaten egg and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth.

Add remaining 3 cups of flour. If dough is not stiff, you can add a bit more flour, but remember the you'll probably add more when you form the pretzels.

Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours. Remove dough from refrigerator. Pinch off a small piece of dough.

On a floured surface, roll dough between your hands and the surface into a long rope, about the thickness of a pencil and about the length of an adult's arm from elbow to fingertips. If dough is sticky, it's all right to add more flour. Form the rope into a circle by bringing the ends towards you. Twist the ends around each other one, then fold them away from you, spreading the ends so
they touch the top half of the circle at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. Place pretzels on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Beat remaining egg and brush pretzels with it lightly. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake in an oven preheated to 400F for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

For bread-like pretzels: let them rise again before cooking For denser: skip rising all together.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            cup  warm water
  1 1/8            tsp  active dry yeast -- (1 1/2 pkg)
  2               tbsp  brown sugar
  1 1/8            tsp  salt
  1                cup  bread flour
  3               cups  regular flour
  2               cups  warm water
  2               tbsp  baking soda
                        coarse salt -- To taste
  2               tbsp  butter -- (melted) (2 to 4)

Sprinkle yeast on lukewarm water in mixing bowl; stir to dissolve. Add sugar, salt and stir to dissolve; add flour and knead dough until smooth and elastic. Let rise at least 1/2 hour. While dough is rising, prepare a baking soda water bath with 2 cups warm water and 2 tbsp baking soda. Be certain to stir often. After dough has risen, pinch off bits of dough and roll into a long rope (about 1/2 inch or less thick) and shape. Dip pretzel in soda solution and place on greased baking sheet. Allow pretzels to rise again. Bake in oven at 450F for about 10 minutes or until golden. Brush with melted butter and enjoy!

Toppings:

After you brush with butter try sprinkling with coarse salt. Or for Auntie Anne's famous Cinnamon Sugar, try melting a stick of butter in a shallow bowl (big enough to fit the entire pretzel) and in another shallow bowl make a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Dip the pretzel into the butter, coating both sides generously. Then dip again into the cinnamon mixture.

NOTES : The longer and thinner you can make the dough rope, the more like Auntie Anne's they will be. (Of course I don't have the counter space!) I  would like to thank Adrienne for this one! Many, many thanks.

  2               cups  Apricot Butter -- Note 1
     1/2                Beaten Egg -- To Brush On Tops

A recipe attributed to "Austria, Hungary, Rumania" in _Breads of the World_
by Mariana Honig, copyright 1977.

"A very versatile dough that makes a fine, delicate and flavorful bread. My
mother-in-law uses it for many different types of coffee cakes or just
plain rolls.

"For example, she puts the dough into a loaf pan and pokes about 2 cups of
halved Italian plums or the same amount of pitted cherries into the dough.

"This recipe makes 2 rolled up coffee cakes filled with apricot butter or
 _lekvar_; or you might want to use prune butter or perhaps a
cinnamon-and-sugar mixture as a filling."

Yield:  2 small loaves or 20 rolls.
Can be frozen.

Note 1: or _lekvar_ or prune butter for filling

Preheat the oven to 375F.

Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water.

In a large bowl, beat the butter, egg yolks, sugar and salt together, then
add the sour cream and the yeast mixture and blend in the flour until you
have a dough.

Now turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until
shiny and smooth but still soft.

Place the dough in a large buttered bowl, cover with a towel and let rise
until doubled in bulk.  This should take about 1 hour.

After the dough has doubled in bulk, return it to the work surface and
knead for a couple of minutes.  Then divide into 2 pieces of equal
size.  With a rolling pin, roll each piece into a rectangle, about 8" wide
by 14" long, and spread 1/2 cup apricot butter evenly onto each
rectangle.  Roll up in jelly-roll fashion and place in two small (8" by 4")
buttered loaf pans.

Cover with a towel and let stand in a warm place to rise for about 30
minutes.  Brush with the beaten egg before placing in the oven.

Bake in the oven until light brown, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Let cool,
wrapped in a towel.

This recipe will also be enough to make about 20 rolls.

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  1                cup  rye flour
  1                cup  all purpose unbleached white flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4          teaspoons  Sourdough Bread Enhancer Formula
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  10            ounces  water -- * (10 to 12)
     1/2           cup  assorted seeds
                        -- such as sesame - caraway
                        -- fennel or poppy
  1         tablespoon  Kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper

Bread machine method: Place the flours, regular salt, Sourdough Bread Enhancer, oil and water in the bread machine and process until a soft, pliable ball of dough forms, adjusting flour or liquid if necessary. Cancel the machine at the end of the first knead cycle.

Food processor method:
Place the flours, regular salt, Sourdough Enhancer in the work bowl of the food processor fitted with the plastic blade. With the machine on add the oil and then the water. When a ball of dough forms, knead for 40 seconds. The dough should be soft and pliable.

Stand mixer method:
Place the flours, regular salt, Sourdough Enhancer in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. With the mixer on lowest speed add the water and oil. Knead on medium speed for 10 minutes, adding more water if necessary to make a smooth, slightly sticky ball of dough.

Allow the dough to rest 15 minutes before proceeding, then preheat the oven to
450 F, with the rack in the upper third of the oven. Lightly coat the underside of a heavy duty jelly roll pan, or a heavy baking sheet with non-stick vegetable spray. Divide the dough in 6 pieces (cover the remaining while you work with each piece). Sprinkle the work surface with a generous amount of seeds and press them into the dough. Roll the dough in a free form shape as thin as possible, then transfer it to the prepared pan and continue rolling until paper thin. Bake for 5-7 minutes or until the edges are crisp and brown and the center has risen unevenly and bubbled. Cool on racks and store uncovered at room temperature.

NOTES : This simple to make cracker bread does not contain yeast or any other
leavening.  A perfect solution to high altitude baking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1600       kilograms  Bread flour -- (variable)
  1                Cup  Sourdough starter -- (room temperature)
  2               tsps  SAF yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  Sugar
     1/2           Cup  Warm water -- (115*F)
  2               cups  Fresh milk
  2               cups  Boiling water
     1/4          cups  Garlic Oil -- (or olive oil)
  2               tbsp  Shortening
  6             cloves  Garlic -- finely minced
  2              large  Red onion -- finely minced
  2         Tablespoon  Basil -- fresh (2 to 3)
                        -- or  1 1/2 teaspoon Dry basil
  1           teaspoon  Dry oregano
  1 1/2       teaspoon  Dry rosemary
  1           teaspoon  Dry Thyme
  1           teaspoon  Garlic powder
  2          teaspoons  Freshly ground black pepper
  1 1/2     Tablespoon  Salt

1. Combine fresh milk and boiling water in a large mixing bowl. Set aside to cool to 115*F

2. Proof yeast in 1/2 teaspoon sugar and warm water.

3. Saute garlic and onion in the oil and shortening. When soft, turn off heat and add all the herbs and pepper but NOT the salt. Toss in the bowl containing milk mixture.

4. Mix in the starter and the yeast. When it's been incorporated add the salt. Mix in the flour a cup at a time until a sticky dough forms.

5. Dump in a well floured work area and knead in the remaining flour with the aid of a dough scraper until a slack dough forms.

6. Form into a ball and place in a well oiled plastic basin or any large plastic container and cover with a generously oiled heavy duty plastic sheet. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.

7. Punch down the dough and thaw for at least two hours well covered.

8. Punch down dough and scale into five 300 gm pcs. and three 400 gm pieces. Round and rest on a well oiled table covered for 10 minutes.

9. Place the 300 gm pieces in five oiled round pizza pans and the 400 gm pieces in oiled 9" square pans. Set aside to rise in a draft free spot covered for at least 1 1/2 hours.

10. Gently poke with two fingers about 1/2" into the dough. Sprinkle generously with olive oil or garlic oil and bake in a preheated 375*F oven for 20 minutes.


notes:
-Remove immediately to cooling rack once it leaves the oven. -Dough will be very billowy and light if the final rising after panning is long.

-You may have to punch down the dough occasionally while it's in the refrigerator.

-Dough can take a lot of stretching so it's alright to be a little rough with it while making it fit the pans.
-Recipe is tested using bread flour because the all purpose flour available in the Philippines is only suitable for making sweet dough.

-Has a good shelf-life but can be frozen successfully without any noticeable loss of flavor.

-Can be successfully trimmed down using about 500 gm of flour (about 4 to 5 Cups). Those interested please email me for directions.

NOTES : Here's a bread that some of you might like to try. Although it takes a while to rest and let the dough rise it can easily be incorporated into any schedule. I used a starter that I "concocted" last January of this year and although I did not have to add more yeast I found out during my experiments that the dough turned out better with the added yeast. The longer rising and resting periods assures you of a very light dough with the characteristic chewy texture. The resulting bread is worth the wait. I apologise that the measurements are given by weight as that is what I normally use for commercial use and for home baking.

** to make an extremely slack ball of dough after the first 3-4 minutes of kneading

The wetter the dough the more holes you'll have - oven temperature is important as well - you need a hot oven to quickly turn the water into steam which forces the dough apart creating the bubbles. Prepare the dough either in a bread machine programmed for dough cycle, a food processor fitted with a plastic blade or stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Allow one full rise. Gently deflate the dough and roll or stretch it to fill the pan. If you want thin crust pizza, divide the dough in two pieces and roll out on the bottom (underside) of two heavy duty jelly roll pans (a.k.a. half sheet pans). Roll very thin, add your topping and bake immediately in a preheated 450F oven for 14-16 minutes or until brown and crusty. For a thick crust pizza, roll the full recipe of dough and allow it to rise until desired thickness, top and bake at 425F for 20-25 minutes.

                        PANCAKE/WAFFLE
  4                     -	Cups Starter
     1/4                -	cup powered milk, (optional)
  2                     -	tablespoons oil
  2                     -	eggs or egg whites, (optional)

  2                     -	tablespoons sugar
  1                     -	tsp baking soda

SOURDOUGH STARTER - Empty the starter into a large bowl and add the warm water. Stir to thoroughly mix. Add the flour. Stir to combine but it is not necessary to remove the lumps. Cover the bowl lightly and place in a warm place for 12-36 hours (depending on hour sour you want the pancakes to be). Within a few hours, the mixture should have a surface of bubbles and a pungent, sour odor. I leave the mixture on the kitchen counter overnight since my starter works fine in a cooler environment.

When you are ready to make the pancakes, remove 4 cups of the starter mixture and place in a mixing bowl. Add about 3/4 of a cup of flour (not included in the above recipe) to the remaining starter and 1/2 cup of water. Mix well but ignore any lumps. Return this mixture to the starter storage container. Allow to sit on counter for 1 hour before returning to refrigerator.

PANCAKE/WAFFLE - To the 4 cups of starter, add the oil, eggs (you may use only the egg whites if you wish to reduce the cholesterol or omit them altogether. They add to the richness), salt and sugar (you may reduce the sugar, however, it does help in browning the pancakes or waffles as some of the sugar caramelizes during cooking) . At this point, it may be necessary to adjust the mixture thickness. This may be done by adding flour or milk.
 Powdered milk or powdered buttermilk may be added as well to make a slightly richer pancake. Use 1/4 cup.

Dissolve the soda in a couple of tablespoons of water and when the griddle is hot, fold the dissolved soda into the pancake mixture. This will cause a leavening action and the mixture will double in volume. This will make the pancakes much lighter and fluffier. The amount of soda may be cut in half, if you wish a more sour tasting pancake.

Bake the pancakes on a hot (400F) griddle turning them once. Sourdough pancakes require a higher cooking temperature than typical for pancakes.

The same mix may be used to make waffles without any necessary adjustments to the recipe. However, for an even fluffier, lighter texture, you can fold in the whites from the eggs used in the recipe. They should be beaten until they are stiff and folded into the mixture before baking.

To reduce the amount of effort at the time you wish to make the pancakes or waffles, I often allow the original starter and the added flour and water to "work" for about 12 hours and the proceed to take 4 cups of the working starter, mix the rest of the ingredients in it and let the mixture continue to "work" another 24 hours or so until I'm ready to make the final pancakes or waffles.

The addition of soda as a leavening agent will reduce the sourness of the batter somewhat. If the batter has doubled in size from the original mixture, you can use it this way instead of adding the soda and water. If you do, be sure not to stir it down as the added air inside the mixture will make the pancakes more fluffy.




                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Here is my recipe for sourdough pancakes and waffles. I've developed the recipe over 30 years or so. You certainly can modify things to suit your own tastes. For example, the sugar I use is intended primarily to give the pancakes and nice brown color as they cook. The sugar caramelizes on the surface. You can omit the sugar, if you wish. The eggs are another example. You can use just the egg whites and throw the yolks away. The egg whites make the pancakes and waffles a little more fluffy. I usually start making the batter 2 days before I plan on using it. Any left overs can be put in the refrigerator for another day. Merely add more soda the second time to give the batter a chance to rise in the bowl, thereby making lighter and fluffier pancakes or waffles.

Note 1: email me at <blanche007@aol.com> for a free sample
Note 2: or extra to make a soft, smooth ball of dough after the first 5-7
minutes  of kneading

Place all the ingredients except the egg white and seeds in the bread
machine and program for DOUGH using the Whole Wheat Setting if
available.  Watch the dough forming during the first few minutes of the
kneading cycle, adding additional water or white flour as needed to form a
smooth, moist, supple ball.  Knead until a smooth ball has formed.

Preheat the oven to 450F with the rack in the center position. Line 4 large
baking sheets with parchment.  Either by hand or using a pasta machine roll
the dough into long strips 1/8" thick.  Place the strips on the baking
sheets, brush with egg with and sprinkle with seeds and salt.  Press
lightly with your fingers to push the seeds into the dough.  Working with
one baking sheet at a time, for 5-6 minutes, then loosen the strips and
place them right on oven rack to bake for another 3-4 minutes until crisp
and brown, but not burned.  These will not cook evenly.  Cool on racks
before storing at room temperature.

                          Sourdough Starter #11

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Starter


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  plain (preferably homemade) yogurt -- *
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour


Mix everything together in a 2-quart glass or pottery bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand on top of the stove or on the countertop for 3 days, stirring once a day. (Don't use a metal spoon.) It should be bubbly after three days. Every time you use it, replenish it with two parts water and three parts flour. I usually feed it with 2/3 C water and 1 cup flour.

*Making homemade yogurt is really easy and fun, especially if you have a microwave oven so you can heat the milk that way instead of standing over the stove stirring it. Homemade yogurt is much better than "store-bought." It's so good that I actually prefer it plain!

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Starter


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast
  2               cups  lukewarm water

Use a glass bowl or container. Left covered on the counter out of the fridge to ferment 2 to 3 days, the starter should become bubbly and ready to use or store.

Because the live yeast responsible for the sourdough flavor is in the air, starters made in different areas of the country may have slightly different characteristics.

Once the starter mix is fed with flour and warm water, it must be left to ferment about 12 hours, until bubbly. Then it can be stored in the refrigerator to prevent over fermentation and used as the basis of bread, biscuits and the like.

It must always be replenished with more flour and water to keep it active. A clear brown liquid often forms on top of the stored starter, but it can be simply stirred back in before use. The starter should have a yeasty, slightly sour smell.

NOTES : Hope this is what you're looking for.  I am going to try this first as
written, then may add a bread dough enhancer minus the wheat gluten. Some
time ago a few people submitted their own recipes for dough enhancers. I
have all the ingredients except the whey which was called for in one of the
submissions.  Guess I'll have to go to a health food store for that
ingredient as Fresh Fields doesn't seem to carry it.  I will also probably
add 1/4 cup dry milk and 1/4 cup potato flour as I find those additions
make a nice loaf of bread in my whole wheat bread recipes.

  1                tsp  sugar
     3/4          cups  warm water -- 105 to 115F
  1                env  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  1                     egg

  6               cups  bread flour
                        Topping:
  2              tbsps  butter -- melted

Stir sugar into warm water in small cup. Sprinkle yeast over top. Let stand until foamy 5 to 10 minutes.

Heat buttermilk, egg, salt, honey and butter in saucepan until butter melts and mixture registers 110F to 120F on instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a large bowl.

Add 2 cups bread flour; beat until smooth. Stir in yeast mixture. Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time until dough holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Transfer dough to lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to large greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down. Let rest for 5 minutes. Grease two 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4-inch loaf pans. Divide dough in half; lightly coat halves with flour. Gently pat each half into 7 x 5 inch rectangle. Transfer to the 2 prepared loaf pans. Cover with clean kitchen towel. Let rise in warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/4 hours.

Heat oven to 350F. With a razor blade or very sharp knife, make a slash down length of each loaf.

Bake in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Open oven; pull rack with breads out slightly. Brush loaves with some of the melted butter. Bake another 15 minutes. Brush again with butter. Bake another 5 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove loaves from pans to wire to cool.

NOTES : These all looked so good to me! I made the Split-Top Butter loaf and it was great! (Hubby and I ate 1/2 of a loaf before it had totally cooled!). The next time I make it, I'm going to add some whole wheat flour to see how it does. The next one I want to try is the Marbled Pumpernickel Rye (I love making croutons out of the store bought stuff!)

                        -- (or wheat pilaf)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly squeezed lemon juice

(2 large loaves)

"This bread uses ... sprouted wheat ... (or wheat pilaf soaked overnight in one-half cup of water). It's a moist, heavy, and very nutritious bread."

[I am going to skip the mixing and kneading directions because they're standard. Ms. Rogers adds, "The dough will be very sticky when you knead. This is a slow-rising dough. Sprinkle the sprouts with lemon juice before adding them to the last kneading."]

"Bake at 375 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes. The sprouts will show slightly when this loaf is sliced, and this bread slices better when thoroughly cooled."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3          cups  Flour -- Unbleached
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  2                Tsp  Cream Of Tartar
                        Salt -- To Taste
  4               Tbsp  Butter -- (1/2 Stick)
     3/4          cups  Milk

I have a wonderful scone recipe that came from a book titled "From Celtic
Hearths" by Deborah Krasner.  It was a Christmas gift about 10 years ago
and I have used it OVER and OVER again.  The author credits the recipe
to  "Scottish Cookery" by Catherine Brown Glenfiddich.  The recipe below is
for Sweet Milk Scones which I basically use as a starting point and then
add whatever we are in the mood for. Most often we eat Parsley and Onion
Scones with potato soup.  My husband and our 2-year old daughter love
them!  I can't tell you how many times he has burned his fingers because
when he smells them cooking he just can't wait for them to cool!  I can't
describe them adequately, they are just wonderful.

Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.  Sift
together the flour, soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Using a pastry blender
or your hands, cut in the butter (or pulse in a food processor) until the
mixture looks like coarse, grainy crumbs.

Pour the  milk in a well in the center and mix until a soft elastic dough
is formed. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Roll
or press the dough out until it is 3/4 inch thick.  (If the dough is too
thin the scone won't rise properly.)

Cut into 2 1/2 or 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and bake on
prepared sheet for about 10 minutes or until they rise and are golden.

The book lists the yield as 8 scones, I usually get 10 or 12 using the full
3 cups of flour.

To make parsley and onion scones add about 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion
and 1 or 2 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes with the dry
ingredients.  These amounts are VERY approximate, I used to measure but now
I just dump in the onion flakes and parsley until it looks "right".

There are other variations listed in the with the recipe, if there is an
interest I can post the variations listed for things like honey, jam, fruit
etc.

NOTES : Tonight I tried Kathy Engel's Sweet Milk Scone Recipe. Dinner was a pot roast and I often prepare buttermilk biscuits with this dish. What a nice change: the scones came out very beautifully and requiring much less fat than most scone recipes. Skim milk in place of whole milk did just fine. [Joni Repasch <jrepasch@wt.infi.net>]

                      The Gluten Washing Experiment

Recipe By     :http://www.crop.cri.nz/foodinfo/millbake/sci_act.htm
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

Aim

To separate and measure the gluten (protein) part of flour from the starch
part. The starch is the milky-white substance washed away.

Materials

Several different brands of white flour
Bowls
Tap water
Spoons
Measuring equipment

Method

1.Take one flour at a time and weigh 20 grams of the flour to be tested and place it in a clean bowl.

2.Add 10 milliliters of tap water and mix into a dough with a spoon, taking care that none of the flour or water is spilled during this procedure. Make sure you mix together all the flour and water.

3.Cover the piece of dough with cold water from the tap and leave it for about 30 minutes.

4.After this time, turn the cold water tap onto a very slow flow and wash the dough. You will need to work the dough all the time (kneading with your fingers) until the water running from it is clear and no longer a "milky" white. It is a good idea to put a sieve under the stream of water to catch any lumps, so you can easily add them back to the ball of dough you are working with. (It is important to collect all the lumps).

5.Once the water is clear, squeeze the gluten ball with your fingers to get rid of as much water as possible, and then lay it aside on a smooth surface for about 10 minutes. More water will settle out.

6.Weigh
the gluten ball and round the weight to the nearest whole number. To estimate how much dry gluten you have, multiply the weight of the gluten ball by 5 and divide the result by 3. For example: from 20 grams of flour, you may have got a gluten ball that weighs 9 grams. Multiply by 5........9 x 5 = 45.........Divide by 3........45 3 = 15% gluten.

Results

Using the example above, the 15% of the flour you started with is protein. The remaining 85% is starch and other substances. Different flours will produce different amounts of gluten. Test each one to find out and record on a line graph. Remember to always:

Mix each sample for the same amount of time
Soak the dough ball for exactly 30 minutes
Keep the temperature of the water the same for all samples
Keep the rate of flow of the washing water, and the amount of washing time the same
Make sure you collect all the dough pieces in the sieve and add them back to the dough.

For fun just get gluten (it's like chewing gum) out of the flour. Use 100 grams of flour and 56 milliliters of water. Make a big thoroughly mixed dough. Soak this, under water, for 30 minutes and then wash it under a constant flow of water in the same way as the experiment above.

How about finding out what happens when gluten is baked. Weigh then place some of the gluten ball on a greased oven tray. Bake it in a hot oven (220C/425F) for about 20 minutes. You will see it blow up into a big ball and then turn golden brown. Let it cool and weigh it again. Break it in half, what do you notice?

Aim:
To see how much gluten protein there is in different kinds of flour.

Materials:
1 cup Wheat Flour
1 cup Rye or Barley Flour
Tap water

Method:

1.Mix enough water with the wheat flour to make a smooth dough like clay.
2.Mix exactly the same amount of water used for the wheat flour with the
rye flour.

Results:

Gluten which is present in wheat soaks up a lot of water because it is a 'thirsty' protein.

The second mixture will stay sticky and wet because there is not enough gluten to soak up all that water.

Not all wheat flours contain the same amount of gluten. High protein wheats contain the most gluten. Bread made out of high protein wheat flour such as bread flour will rise the most. Low protein wheats such as cake flour contain the least amount of gluten and therefore will rise the least. All purpose flour is a blend of high and low protein wheats and will produce a medium sized loaf of bread.

        Tips For More Flavor And Crisp Crust (Ie, European Bread)

                        *****

I use a pizza stone (actually unglazed ceramic tiles -- a cheap pizza stone) and preheat the oven to 500 degrees for at least a half hour. I bake the bread directly on the stone, transferring it with a pizza peel. Before I put the bread in the oven, I spray the oven with water and then I spray it 2 or 3 more times during the first five minutes. After 5 minutes, I turn the heat down to 450 degrees and don't open the oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, I move the loaves around to get more even browning and bake for 15 or 20 minutes more. (I usually bake 2 2-pound loaves at a time.) I check the internal temperature of the loaves with an instant read thermometer. It should be between 210 and 220 degrees. This should give you a hard crust. This works very well with bread that has no sugar or only a trace amount. I've tried baking some that have more sweetener and the bread has tasted good, but the crust turns pretty black at that temperature.

To improve the flavor of your bread, try retarding it in the refrigerator over night. After it is shaped, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise in the fridge over night. In the morning, take it out, let it finish rising and bake. You may find that you need to cut down on the yeast some. This works especially well with sourdoughs because they tend to rise slowly. Sometimes my "french" bread rises too much overnight. If you don't have refrigerator space for shaped loaves, you can give the dough a cold rise in a plastic bag and shape it the next day and let it rise again. Another way to improve the flavor is to save a cup of dough and use it the next time you make bread. You can keep it for 2 or 3 days in the refrigerator or freeze it if you aren't making bread that often. When you make your next dough, you mix it as normal and then add the old dough about half way through the kneading. A sponge or poolish is another method which will improve the flavor. Basically, anything you can do to give the yeast longer to work will make your bread taste a little better.



                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Another thing you might try is to check out the "artisan bread flours"
offered by King Arthur.  They have products called "European-Style
Artisan Bread Flour," "French-Style Flour," and "Italian-Style Flour."

I have found that the simpler the dough, the better the bread, so bear
that in mind, too! [Ruth Provance <prmtprovance@erols.com>]

                        *****

Making tons of bread ... two techniques that work for me are

(a) Let half of the batch rise again! I've never had bread resent an additional rise, though under kneading is a serious sin. So, if your batch is more than your oven can take, just shape half of it and let the other half rise until the first half is out of the oven.

(b) Pack 'em in! It's a little bit of work in re-arranging once the crust is set (about 2/3 of the way through the baking time), but I can indeed fit a dozen smaller loaf pans into my standard gas-range oven. You put four front-to-back across the back of the top shelf, and two side-to-side across the front of it. Repeat for the second shelf. When re-arranging, move front-to-back and left-to-right, and (sigh) change shelves. this sounds much more awful than it is, once you've done it. Here's some visual help (a shelf as seen from above):

     First pass      1  2  3  4
                   --5--   --6--

     Second pass   --6--   --5--
                     4  3  2  1

the saving grace is, you don't have to turn each individual pan around because you're re-arranging them so the end that started in the middle finishes on the outside edge. With this trick, I can bake a dozen Christmas stollens at one time (and I need to!)

This bread is nutritious and is loaded with fiber! It makes delicious toast.

egg and egg white; add to flour mixture, stirring just until moist.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead lightly 4 times with
floured hands.  Roll dough into a 12x6-inch rectangle.  Cut dough into 8
(3-inch) squares using a dull knife or a dough scraper.  Cut each square
into 2 triangles; place on a baking sheet coated with cooking

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           Cup  granulated sugar
  2          Teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      Teaspoon  salt
  5        Tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled
     1/2           Cup  milk
  1              Large  egg
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           Cup  dried papaya -- chopped
     1/2           Cup  dried pineapple -- chopped
     1/2           Cup  macadamia nuts -- chopped
     1/2           Cup  coconut -- shredded
  3             Ounces  white chocolate -- 1/2 inch pieces

Preheat oven to 375F. Lightly butter a 9 inch diameter circle in the center of a baking sheet.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, stir together the milk, egg, and vanilla. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir to combine. Stir in the papaya, pineapple, macadamia nuts, coconut, and white chocolate until evenly distributed.

With lightly floured hands, pat the dough into a 8 inch circle in the center of the prepared baking sheet. With a serrated knife, cut into 8 wedges. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes out clean.

Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool. Re-cut into wedges, if necessary. Serve warm, or cool completely and store in an airtight container. These freeze well.

  2               cups  whole wheat flour
  1 1/2           cups  bread flour -- divided
  2               cups  water
     3/4          cups  baking potato -- peeled and diced
  1                pkg  dry yeast
  3              tbsps  honey
  1               tbsp  vegetable oil

  1               tbsp  pumpkin seeds, roasted -- unsalted
  1               tbsp  sunflower seeds

Lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine water and potato in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes or until tender. Place mixture into a blender; process until smooth. Reserve 1 1/2 cups potato liquid; discard the remaining potato liquid. Cool the potato liquid to warm (100 to 110). Combine 1 cup bread flour, potato liquid, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

Add whole-wheat flour, honey, oil and salt to yeast mixture. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining bread flour, 1 tbsp at a time to prevent the dough from sticking to hands (the dough will feel tacky). Place dough into a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, the dough has risen enough.)

Preheat oven to 375 F.

Uncover dough; brush with egg white over loaf. Sprinkle dough with pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. Bake at 375 F for 30 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.

What happens when carbon dioxide from yeast is not used in making
bread?

To find out you need 50 grams of plain flour and water.

Put the flour in a bowl and gradually add the water, mixing all the time.
Add water until you have a stiff paste or dough.
Roll the dough into a ball on a floured surface.
Place in a greased baking tin and bake at 230C (450F) for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

NOTES : This dense, round loaf is great for sandwiches or as an accompaniment to a meal, soup or stew. Wheat berries, which can be cooked and eaten as a cereal or softened and added to baked goods, are whole, unprocessed kernels of wheat. Look for them in health-food stores and some supermarkets.

                               Wheat Gluten

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                 lb  white flour

large bowls and colander
large container that can be sealed, hold liquids and small enough to fit in the fridge
large microwave bowl for cooking 45 minute approx.
microwave oven

Make a smooth dough in the evening. Fill the sealable container with cold water and place dough in it also. Seal this container and place it in the fridge over night.

Late next morning take the dough out and throw out the water. Put the dough in a large colander inside of a large bowl. Pour a stream of room temperature water over the dough as it is vigorously kneaded. Keep rinsing and kneading the dough in the water until all of the white wheat starch is washed away.

Place the wheat gluten which should have lost all white colour, into an open container for microwave cooking. The gluten should be strained of water as much as possible. Microwave the wheat gluten for 45 minutes or until it develops a somewhat hard skin on the top. The gluten should not be covered when cooking. It may rise as much as bread so make sure it has plenty of room.

After it is well cooked take it out and dump it upside down into another bowl and allowed to cool. After it is cool enough to handle it needs to be cut into bite size pieces. The bite size pieces can be refrigerated in a sealed container at least for a few days. Add some bite size pieces of cooked wheat gluten in with your favorite vegetable preparation.

Gluten is a protein and this makes a preparation more desirable. However, some people may have difficulty in digesting gluten. To remedy this use a small amount of chile as well as digestive aids like ginger and turmeric in your preparation. Also it is wise not to make the gluten the main meal. Since gluten is made from wheat it might be best to cut down on other wheat preparations in the meal.

Use soy sauce and nutritional yeast to add a cheese flavor to your preparation. Of course, you must account for the salt in the soy sauce. You may like to salvage the wheat starch that is washed away to uncover the gluten. If you have used good quality flour you may want to use this wheat starch for gravy and other preparations.

Serving Idea:

Try sprinkling the small chunks of cooked gluten with soy sauce, olive oil, and which can also be mixed with nutritional yeast. This should be done before adding the chunks of wheat gluten to another vegetable preparation.

I like to prepare the small chunks of wheat gluten like this before covering them with "Ugma" a preparation I learned while living in the Hare Krsna temple. Your vegetable preparation should have enough juice to soak the chunks of wheat gluten. The chunks of wheat gluten will expand once soaked. I've noticed that olive oil tends to combine rather well with tomato sauce.

Place first 4 ingredients inside the bread pan. Add molasses and water. Close cover and place dry yeast into the yeast holder. SELECT: WHOLE WHEAT DOUGH MODE. Press start. (Breadmaker completes the basic dough mode 3 hours and 15 minutes later)

Rest in a greased covered bowl in refrigerator for 20 minutes.

Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion on a lightly floured surface into a log, approximately 3/4 inch thick and 8 inches long, using the palm of your hand.

Seal the ends together tightly to make a ring with a 1 1/2 to 2 inch hole in the center.

Place on a greased baking pan. Spray water on top. Proof at 90F. for 30 minutes.

Bring 1 gallon water with 1 Tbsp sugar to a boil.

Reduce to a simmer. Cook 4 or 5 bagels at a time for 7 minutes, turning once. Drain well.

Place on a greased baking pan. Sprinkle tops with poppy seeds or sesame seeds, if desired. Bake in 450F oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown, turning them over after half the baking time.

                          Whole Wheat Thin Bread

                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               pkgs  active dry yeast
  2              cups.  warm water -- (about 110F)
  2              tbsp.  sugar
  1              tbsp.  salt
     1/2         cups.  butter or margarine -- (1/4 lb.) melted &
                        cooled
  2 1/2          cups.  whole wheat flour
     1/2         cups.  wheat germ
                        About 3 c. all-purpose flour -- (unsifted)
  1                     egg
     1/4         cups.  cold water
     3/4         cups.  sesame seeds -- About

In the large bowl of a mixer, soften yeast in the warm water for about 5 minutes. Stir in sugar, salt & butter. Add whole wheat flour, wheat germ & 1 c. of the all-purpose flour; stir until evenly moistened, then beat at medium speed for 5 minutes, pushing dough down as needed. (Without a mixer, beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture is stretchy & begins to pull away from the bowl as you beat.) Then by hand, stir in another 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour to make the dough stiff enough to knead. (If you have a heavy mixer with a dough hook, add the whole wheat, wheat germ & 1 c. all-purpose flour & beat for 5 minutes at medium speed; then add 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour & beat 5 minutes or until dough pulls away from bowl.) Turn dough out onto a board coated with part of the remaining 1/2 c. all-purpose flour & knead until smooth & satiny; this takes 8 to 10 minutes (about 5 minutes with a dough hook). Place dough in an oiled bowl; turn over to oil top. Cover tightly & let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down dough, knead lightly to release air bubbles, then divide into 12 equal-size pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball & place about 1 inch apart on a lightly floured tray or baking sheet. Cover with clear plastic film & allow to rest at room temperature for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare egg glaze by lightly beating egg & cold water together. Rolling & Baking: Arrange oven racks so that one is on the bottom level & the other at the top level of your oven.

Roll out one ball of dough at a time on a lightly floured board to about a 12-inch circle or a 10 X 12-inch oval--it will be almost paper-thin. Carefully roll it onto your rolling pin & unroll onto an ungreased baking sheet. Brush lightly with egg glaze & sprinkle with about 1 T. sesame seed. Prick surface 3 or 4 time with a fork, & place on the lowest rack of oven. Bake bread in a 400F oven for about 8 minutes total, or until golden brown & puffy. After baking about 4 minutes or when you have the next sheet rolled, move the first bread to top of oven & place second one on the bottom rack. Continue in this way until all are baked. Cool briefly on racks, then stack.

Store the cooled breads tightly wrapped in plastic bags. If they lose crispness, place in a 300F oven for about 5 minutes or until crisp again. Makes 12 large rounds.

WHITE FLOUR THIN BREAD

Instead of the mixture of flours used in the above recipe, use about 6 c. all-purpose flour, adding 4 c. in the first addition & remaining flour as directed.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  bread flour -- up to 4 1/2 cups
  1                env  fast-acting yeast
  1                     sweet Italian sausage -- (about 4 oz) casing
                        removed
  12               ozs  beer -- amber or regular
  2              tbsps  sugar
  2               tsps  salt
  4                ozs  shredded cheddar cheese -- about 1 cup
  4                     scallions -- chopped (about 1/2
                        cup)
                        Topping:
  2              tbsps  butter -- melted

Mix together 2 cups flour and yeast in large bowl.

Cook sausage in small skillet, breaking apart with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Heat beer, sugar and salt in saucepan until 120 to 130F on instant read thermometer. Pour into flour-yeast mixture in bowl. Beat with wooden spoon for about 100 strokes.

Add remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Add sausage, 1/2 cup cheese, scallions; knead with hands.

Transfer dough to lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking. Transfer dough to greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down. Divide in half. Let rest 5 minutes. Shape each half into oblong loaf, about 10 x 3 inches. Transfer to greased baking sheet. Cover with clean kitchen towel. Let rise in warm place until doubled in volume, 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 350F. Using razor blade or sharp knife, make long slash down center of each loaf. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese down center of each loaf.

Bake in 350Fe oven for 15 minutes. Brush each loaf with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Bake another 15 to 20 minutes or until golden and loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove to wire rack to cool. Serve slightly warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  water -- *
  1                cup  plain yogurt -- nonfat or regular,
                        doesn't matter
  1                     egg -- don't bother to
                        beat it first
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
  2        Tablespoons  oil
                        -- or softened butter
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  3               cups  bread flour
  2        Tablespoons  toasted wheat germ -- (optional)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  yeast
                        -- (I use Red Star)
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed Vitamin C tablet

* (cooking water saved from boiling potatoes is preferred but  plain ol water will do)

Place in machine according to your manufacturer's directions. This is the order I use in mine. This makes a 1-1/2 pound loaf which works fine on a basic white bread setting.

Or use your dough cycle. When finished, remove the dough to an oiled board and let sit a few minutes. Then pat out, shape into a roll and plop into an oiled bread pan. Let rise 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425F. When dough has risen place in oven and immediately turn heat down to 375F. It should be done in 30 minutes. This loaf rises so high in the oven you will need to make sure you don't place the loaf too close to the shelf above it.

Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Scones


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  White Flour -- Unbleached
  1 1/2           cups  Whole-Wheat Flour
  2                Tsp  Baking Powder
  2                Tsp  Baking Soda
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  6               Tbsp  Cold Butter
  2               Tbsp  Packed Brown Sugar
  1 1/4           cups  Nonfat Yogurt -- *Note
     1/2          cups  Egg Beaters(r) 99% Egg Substitute -- **Note
     1/2          cups  Packed Raisins -- Or Sultanas, Currant

These scones are unusually light and fluffy.

Unlike most recipes for scone, this one doesn't require any rolling or cutting of the dough. In fact, the "dough" is more of a batter, and can be dropped - like cookies - directly onto the baking sheet. Because of this great shortcut, the recipe can be completely assembled in just 15 minutes. So pull this one out if you have guests coming for tea on short notice.

*NOTE: Original recipe used firm yogurt
**NOTE: Original recipe used 2 regular eggs

Preheat oven to 400F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray or an alternative.

Sift together the first 5 ingredients. Then cut together with butter and brown sugar, using a food processor (steel blade attachment), pastry cutter or electric mixer - until uniformly blended. It should resemble coarse meal. If using a feel processor, transfer everything to a bowl.

Beat the yogurt together with 1 egg. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and add the yogurt mixture along with the dried fruit. Mix as minimally as possible, with swift, decisive strokes, until well blended. Drop by rounded quarter-cup measures onto the lightly greased sheet. Beat the remaining egg. Brush the tops with beaten egg (the softness of the batter might require you to pat, rather than brush, it on).

Bake 12 - 15 minutes. Serve hot or warm.

Prep Time: 30 minutes

Yield: 1 - 1 1/2 doz

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  plain yogurt
     1/2          tsp.  baking soda
  1               dash  salt

                        rosewater or orange water syrup

Heat oil to 375F in heavy duty kettle or fryolator.

Beat yogurt until smooth and thinned. Stir in baking soda and enough flour so mixture can be dropped from a spoon.

Use two ( wet spoons with water ) spoons to scoop up dough and to scrape off from one into the oil ) Fry golden on each side ( it will take several minutes.) Drain on absorbent paper and then toss or coat with syrup. Use any recipe for a simple syrup ( such as boil 1/2 cup water and 1 cup sugar until syrupy. Remove from heat and add to taste 1/2 to 1 tsp of rosewater or orange water syrup.) This flavoring is available in many gourmet foods stores.
As with any fried foods; serve immediately.

Yield: variable, depending on size of dough dropped from spoon.

NOTES : Here is another deep fried recipe called Zalebes also known as Zingzoola and by other names.

It is Middle Eastern in origin; the fritters often in coiled ( snail ) shapes, sticks or puffs. Some recipes do not use yogurt and others are just a mixture of flour and water. All are tossed in a honey or sweet syrup before serving.
