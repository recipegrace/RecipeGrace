     1/2  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      Tabasco sauce

Trim all fat from meat.  Slice meat with the grain to about 1/4" to 1/2" thick.  The meat slices nicely when semi-frozen, or your butcher will slice it for you in his machine.  Place meat in the cool marinade and leave overnight, or for no less than 8 hours.

Remove from brine and allow to air dry without rinsing.  Smoke in your smoker for 12 to 16 hours or until jerky has dried out to your liking.  Use your favorite fuel for smoking.

   1      quart         white wine
   1 1/2  cups          salt

NOTES: The larger recipe makes about 2 gallons, the smaller recipe makes about a quart. It doesn't need refrigeration. Simply mix all ingredients well in a large pot and simmer for 30 minutes. Let cool and bottle. The pepper gets rid of the gamy flavor. The kids fight over venison marinated in this stuff.

   2      tablespoons   habanero hot sauce
   1      teaspoon      chile sesame oil
   1      tablespoon    sweet basil

We started with a 750 lb. steer. We let him age in the cooler for 12 days. We had him cut up all into rolled roasts between 10 and 15 lbs. and all deboned. I would guesstamate we got 160 lbs. of roasts. I took around 100 lbs. of the roasts for our 4th of July party at our VFW club and did the following: Marinated for 36 hours. Then I cooked these roasts on my rotisserie at 250F for 12 hours using hickory for smoke. The last 45 minutes I put a glaze of C.J's gourmet barbecue sauce which is fairly sweet so added a little cayenne. This was excellent beef. Totally moist and totally devoured. We had this after we had a golf tournament on 4 wheelers using a tennis ball for the golf ball in cow pasture. Made a nine hole course with water hazards and the works. Had dogs get them out of the water, were they wore out. Lots of fun and had a great fireworks show to top it off, great 4th.

Lightly freeze the meat to help in slicing Slice into about 1/2 inch or less strips ,across the grain, with the grain for chewier jerky, and marinate over night I start them in the smoker on a rack for 2 to 3 hours then finish in a dehydrator. Could do the whole process on the smoker if you keep the temp low enough . That's it , it never lasts long enough around here to worry about storing it . Thanks again for all the response.

NOTES : I've not personally tried this one, but a friend has done it for several groups. She smokes (usually uses mesquite) about six pounds of beef (flank steak, roast, whatever) with only a rub of garlic, little bit of pepper, salt, and dash of cumin... then makes a mole sauce (recipe follows), slices the beef and serves it with the sauce.

   2      teaspoons     chili powder
     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan and cook the onion and garlic, gently for 10 minutes. Add the catsup, vinegar, Worcestershire, brown sugar, chili powder, and cayenne, and mix well. Let simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Makes about 2-1/2 cups

This sauce has a nice balance of sweet, tart, and spice. Because the sauce contains sugar, it burns easily, and is best brushed on food just during the last 5 or 10 minutes of cooking. Pass the remaining sauce around the table.

Rubs are applied to the exterior surface of the meat just before Grilling; they need no standing time.  However for convenience rubs may be Applied several hrs. in advance.  The coated meat should be refrigerated Until grilling time.

Flavors become more pronounced the longer the rub is on the meat. Create your own blend or seasonings for rubs or use a commercial blend. Tips for marinade always marinate in the refrigerator; never at room temp Allow 1/4-1/2 cup of marinade for each 1-2 lbs. meat marinades may be Cooked or uncooked.  Cooked marinades should be completely cooled before use.

A heavy duty plastic food bag is convenient for marinating. Select dishes In which the meat will fit snugly but lie flat turn meat occasionally During marinating so all sides are exposed to the marinade for Tenderization to take place most meat cuts must be marinated for at least 6 hrs, or as long as overnight. For flavor marinate 15 min or as long as 2 hrs. Marinades may also be brushed on during grilling. Discard used marinades never reuse them.

Bill Ackerman has improved a rub from 'La Parilla'. It is pretty basic--just anchos, chipotles, oregano, garlic and salt. But, boy howdy, is it good! Last night I rubbed pork chops and grilled them. Served with a basic red chile sauce.

Pan roast chilies and oregano until fragrant. When cool, grind in spice mill with garlic and salt.

I'm not sure of Bill's proportions but this is what I have been using.

For the sauce, stem and seed the dried chilies. Toast them in a heavy skillet until fragrant. Grind when cool in a food processor. Add tomatoes, garlic and chipotle. Add enough water to make it pourable. Strain in a food mill. Pour it back in the skillet and heat to bubbling. Salt to taste. Sugar to taste, if necessary.

I tried the rub on chicken. Then I started a lump charcoal fire, put the chicken in the cold cooking chamber, threw on heavy apple wood smoke initially and slowly ran the temp up to 350F over 1.25 hours. The chicken was moist with a crispy skin.

   8                    cloves of garlic -- unpeeled

  10                    black peppercorns -- scant 1/4 t ground
   2      large         bay leaves broken up
     1/8  teaspoon      cumin seed -- or 1/8 t ground
     1/2  teaspoon      dried oregano
     1/2  teaspoon      dried thyme
   1 1/2  teaspoons     salt
     1/4  cup           cider vinegar

Toasting the chilies and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until blackened in spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool, skin and roughly chop.

While the garlic is roasting, tear the chilies into flat pieces and toast them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly against the hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister, crackle and change color, then flip them over and press them flat to toast the other side.

Soaking the dried chilies. Break the chilies into a small bowl, cover with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30 minutes.

Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and add the garlic.

Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chilies along with the oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tbsp. water. With a long series of blender pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the blender for a few seconds until the mixture clogs, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and stir; repeat a dozen times or more until the mixture is smooth. Don't add water unless absolutely necessary or this marinating paste won't do its job well. Strain the paste through a medium-mesh sieve into a non-corrosive container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.

Considerations: After soaking the chilies, they can be put through a Foley food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree along with the garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this is done, and the mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and pulsed, scraped down, and mixed very well the final sieving can be eliminated. All of the chilies can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2 ounces of California or New Mexican chilies  for the above chilies but the flavor will be light.

Adobo with powdered chilies: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chilies and garlic as directed above, then pulverize the chilies with the cinnamon, cloves, pepper, bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a spice grinder; sift through a medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with the powdered chile mixture, oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tbsp. water.

Store as directed above.

Source: FOOD day, July 9, '91 From: Valerie Whittle  This spicy marinade owes its unusual flavor to the chipotle, a smoked jalapeno chile.  Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste. Look for them at Mexican and Latin American markets.  Adobo marinade goes particularly well with pork.

 Juice the oranges and lime.  Finely chop chilies and garlic.  Place citrus juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar and salt in blender and puree until smooth.

 Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.

   2      tablespoons   tomato paste
   1      teaspoon      black pepper -- freshly ground

Toast the chilies directly over a medium gas flame or in a cast-iron skillet until soft and brown, turning frequently to avoid scorching.  Transfer the toasted chilies to a saucepan and add the vinegar and water.
Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 10 minutes to soften.  Transfer the chilies and liquid to a blender or food processor. Puree until a smooth paste is formed, adding a tablespoon or 2 of water if necessary to thin. Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Saut� the onions until golden brown, 8-10 minutes.  Stir in the garlic and cook briefly just to release the aroma.  Next, stir in the cumin and cook another minute.  Add the chicken stock and reserved chile paste. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix together the brown sugar, orange and lemon juices, tomato paste, salt and pepper to form a paste.  Add to the simmering stock mixture and continue cooking another 15 minutes.

NOTE:  Adobe Sauce can be stored in the refrigerator 1 week or frozen indefinitely.

Makes 1 1/2 quarts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      large clove   garlic
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   2      cups          plain whole-milk yogurt
   4      tablespoons   juice and pulp of 1 large lemon
     1/2  teaspoon      cracked black pepper
   2      large         whole chicken breasts

Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's as delicious as it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or Arab flatbread and fresh yogurt.

Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and mash them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.

Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.

Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.

To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but should not char. Serve at once.

Buy a whole Sub-Primal rib eye or strip loin when they are on sale (I think these things weigh 10 - 20 pounds, so take your piggy-bank to the store with you :-)).  You probably won't find Prime, but make sure you get no less than Choice.

Take it out of the plastic wrap that it comes in and rinse it off with cold water.  Let it drain and pat dry with paper towels.

Wrap the meat in a large plain white cotton dish towel and put it on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.  The bottom shelf is the coldest place in the refrigerator and is out of the way.  It might be a good idea to check the temperature with a freezer thermometer to be sure it is not too far outside the 34 - 38 F range.  Adjust the refrigerator temperature if necessary.  This could be a very expensive mistake if the refrigerator is too warm :-).

The next day, change the towel.  The first towel will be soiled by the moisture that has seeped from the meat.  Continue to change towels as needed, from 10 days to 2 weeks.  Now you can start to enjoy good steaks.

Cut steaks as needed from each end.  Rewrap the unused portion and
continue to replace the towels while the remainder ages.

If you have not finished the entire piece after aging for 21 days, remove the remainder from the refrigerator and cut into individual steaks.  Wrap each one in heavy-duty plastic freezer wrap and freeze. They will keep for months in the freezer.

To clean the soiled cotton towels for re-use, soak them in cold water overnight.  Next, soak them in cold salt water for 2 - 3 hours to remove any blood stains.  Then launder as usual.

The general principles of aging are:

1) Temperature: Warmer ages faster with more mold growth and trimming
but more flavor. Carcass needs to be chilled as soon after slaughter as possible. Over 38F. meat can get slick and off flavors then spoils.  Commercially, meat is aged close to 33 for 10 days and has no aged flavor.

2) Humidity: Higher humidity encourages mold growth which enhances flavor to a point and increases trim losses.

3) Carcass Quality: The higher the quality (fatter, more marbling, not too old - preferably 2 years) the better beef ages and the better the flavor and the longer it should be aged. Lean breeds (dairy crosses, etc.) and grass fed animals should only be aged 2 to 3 weeks. Prime hindquarters can easily go for 4 to 6 weeks (This is truly "melt in your mouth" meat and is pure ecstasy!).  Breeding is of  lesser importance as long as there is a sufficient standard beef breeding (Hereford, Angus, Shorthorn, Devon, etc.) to have the quality.

4) Time. Depends upon temperature and quality. Ten days minimum, 6 weeks maximum. Forequarters don't age as well as hinds and should come out about a week earlier.

                          All South Barbeque Rub

Recipe By     : Richard Thead
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Rubs And Spices

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      tablespoons   salt
   2      tablespoons   sugar
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   ground cumin
   2      tablespoons   chile powder
   2      tablespoons   freshly cracked black pepper
   1      tablespoon    cayenne pepper
   4      tablespoons   paprika

The rub is the second most important part of the BBQ process, next to the smoking technique. There are two main concepts to keep in mind when formulating your rub.  The proportion of salt should be great enough to trigger osmosis and begin to draw the moisture from the surface of the meat, and (some may disagree with this) the proportion of sugar should not be excessive because it will  caramelize and burn during smoking leaving a bitter taste.  However, since sugar contributes to osmosis, it is an important component and shouldn't be eliminated.

Beyond that, your rub should only be limited by your imagination.  Other ingredients to consider can include paprika, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chile powder, oregano, sage or whatever sounds good to you.

I like to keep my rub in a shaker for easy application.  Rub should be applied at least the night before smoking.  Anything longer, up to three days, is better.  Shake the rub over the entire surface of the meat to be smoked.  Use a generous amount at first and then, as it starts to get moist and adhere, add more.  I don't think it's necessary to "rub" it in.  I find that that only results in uneven distribution, and besides, it stains your hands.  Wrap the meat loosely in butcher paper and leave in the fridge until a couple of hours before smoking.

I find rubs to be far more useful than marinades especially for large pieces of meat such as briskets and pork butts. For cuts such as these, the internal and external fat melt through the meat during cooking to keep it moist.  I believe that the texture of the meat is improved by drawing out excess moisture, before cooking, through osmosis. The dry surface of the meat and the rub itself combine to produce a flavorful and attractive crust on the finished product.  Unless it is thoroughly blotted dry on the surface, marinated meat won't color properly.

NOTES : Simply mix together.  I usually double or quadruple the recipe since it is used liberally.

   1                    serranos and jalapeno -- seeded and chopped
   2 1/2  lbs.          tomatillos -- slice 1/8" thick
   7      lbs.          green tomatoes -- slice 1/4" thick
     1/2  bunch         cilantro -- rough chop
   4      cloves        garlic
   1      med.          white onion -- chopped
     1/4  cup           lime juice
     1/4  cup           apple cider vinegar
   2      tbs.          salt
   4      tbs.          corn starch

Heat a large cast iron skillet to hot and toast the tomatoes and  tomatillos without any oil.  Do just one layer at a time and give each  slice a nice dark brown color on both sides without burning.  Remove  when toasted to a glass bowl.  Do not deglaze the pan. In a blender, combine the onion, cilantro, chilies, tomatoes, garlic and tomatillos in batch sizes to half-fill the blender jar.  Puree.  If any dark brown liquid collects in the bottom of the toasted tomato and tomatillo bowl, add this to the last blender load. Mix the cornstarch in the lime juice/vinegar.  In a large stewing pot, combine the blender loads, add the cornstarch mixture and heat until  the sauce comes to a low boil, mixing constantly.  Be careful here, if  you don't mix constantly the thick sauce will tend to erupt in hot  little geysers of taco sauce that could burn you.  Allow sauce to cool  and add salt to taste.  Transfer to clean jars, filling them 3/4 full  and freeze what you can't use in a few weeks.  Be careful not to fill  the jars too full or they'll break when you freeze them. I made a batch of sauce last year and it tastes just fine after a year  in the freezer.  The sauce keeps OK in my refrigerator for at least a  month. * Adjust heat level to your personal taste.  The La Victoria sauce is  mild. 3 to 4 quarts

As a fellow Southern "shivering" in this inhospitable Northern Iceland (why go to Reykjavik when you can have it all here?), I want to pass on to you one of my Brunswick Stew recipe to fortify you before grading student papers, prepare lectures, and such. Starting way in advance, poach one 4 lb. chicken. Then add a 2 lb. rabbit that's been quartered (if you don't find any in your backyard by all means substitute veal) and put on high heat and then simmer with the chicken with additional water to cover. You should add the rabbit some 35 minutes after having poached the chicken. 
When done, drain, reserve the stock and cool the meats on a platter. Once the meats are cool enough to touch with your fingers, bone the chicken and the rabbit and chop into bite-size pieces. Return the chicken and rabbit morsels into the stockpot and add a Virginia ham bone (if you got one) along with 2 cups of sliced onions, 2 cups of chopped celery, 1 cup carrots, and 2 cups of sliced cabbage. Add garlic, marjoram, 2 bay leaves, and a little dash of cayenne (optional). Stir in 2-3 lbs. of chopped tomatoes with juice, bring to a boil, then simmer for 25 minutes. Add 1 lb. of lima beans, 1 1/2 lbs. chopped potatoes, and 4 cups of corn. 
Bring to a boil again and then simmer, stir the pot a bit to prevent burning. This will take another hour. Season with salt and black pepper. An option is to sprinkle finely chopped parsley into the pot. You can serve this on a bed of rice, or with biscuit, or, as I like to do, with fresh baguettes. A nicely tossed salad with vinaigrette dressing would be a nice accompaniment to your stew. Choose a good, full-bodied red wine to serve with your stew and you and your guests can tell winter to do its worst.

                 Andouille - Chef John's  (Cajun Sausage)

Recipe By     : Chef John Folse

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        pork butt
     1/2  pound         pork fat
     1/2  cup           chopped garlic
     1/4  cup           cracked black pepper
   2      tablespoons   cayenne pepper
   1      tablespoon    dry thyme
   4      tablespoons   salt
   6      feet          beef middle casing (from butcher)

Cube pork butt into one and a half inch cubes. Using a meat grinder with four one quarter inch holes in the grinding plate, grind pork and pork fat. If you do not have a grinding plate this size, I suggest hand cutting pork butt into one quarter inch square pieces.

Place ground pork in large mixing bowl and blend in all remaining ingredients. Once well blended, stuff meat into casings in one foot links, using the sausage attachment on your meat grinder. Tie both ends of the sausage securely using a heavy gauge twine.

In your home-style smoker, smoke andouille at 175-200F for approximately four to five hours using pecan or hickory wood. The andouille may then be frozen and used for seasoning gumbos, white or red beans, pastas or grilling as an hors d'oeuvre.

NOTES : Andouille is the Cajun smoked sausage so famous nationally today. Made with pork butt, shank and a small amount of pork fat, this sausage is seasoned with salt, cracked black pepper and garlic. The andouille is then slowly smoked over pecan wood and sugar cane. True andouille is stuffed into the beef middle casing which makes the sausage approximately one and a half inches in diameter. When smoked, it becomes very dark to almost black in color. It is not uncommon for the Cajuns to smoke andouille for seven to eight hours at approximately 175F.

Traditionally, the andouilles from France were made from the large intestines and stomach of the pig, seasoned heavily and smoked. In parts of Germany, where some say andouille originated, the sausage was made with all remaining intestines and casings pulled through a larger casing, seasoned and smoked. It was served thinly sliced as an hors d'oeuvre.

A tropical resort in an urban location, Miss Pearl's Jam House sits near the center of San Francisco. Chef Joey Altman is the creative wizard behind the dishes that seem to sing and dance their way across the multicolored dining room. He cooks up some visionary stuff, like Seared Scallops with Potato Crust and Citrus Beurre Blanc, Oyster Hot Shot with Chile Ginger Salsa,  Angry Pork Tenderloin, and Coconut Sorbet. Palm trees and other greenery, original island-style paintings on the walls, and Caribbean tunes all combine to make a delightful setting for a tropical vacation without leaving the states. Don't miss the Sunday Poolside Brunch with Eggs Over Evil! Find Miss Pearl's at 601 Eddy Street (corner of Larkin), San Francisco, CA 94109, (415) 775-JAMS.

If using dried Chipotle, cover with hot water and allow to sit for 15
minutes to soften. Remove the stems.

Place all ingredients except the olive oil and the tenderloins in a blender or food processor and puree, slowly drizzling in the oil. Marinate the meat in this mixture for at least an hour.

Grill the tenderloins over medium-high heat or bake in a 400F oven for about 8 minutes, turning every 2 minutes. Slice the tenderloins into 1/2 inch pieces and serve with black beans, rice, salsa, and tortillas.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 6    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Greek

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        lean ground lamb
   2      slices        homemade bread, toasted -- crumbled
   1      teaspoon      allspice -- crushed
   1      teaspoon      coriander seed -- crushed
   1      clove         garlic -- pressed
   1                    onion -- grated
   1      teaspoon      fresh savory -- chopped
                        salt -- to taste
                        freshly ground pepper -- to taste
                        bacon slices -- optional

In large bowl, combined all ingredients.  Mix well, kneading until mixture is stiff.  Make fingers of meat (about 5-inches longer and not over 2-inches in diameter).  Place fingers on skewer spacing about 1-inch apart.  Cook over hot coals for 10 to 15 minutes, turning frequently until cooked through.

You may wrap the "fingers" on the skewer with sliced bacon.  If anyone tries this, let me know how it works out.

NOTE: I have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S., but as I have said, I view it as a "deli" item.  Krinos Foods has a "gyros kit" that is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets.

Use a tart apple.  The best apple to use is Gravenstein.  If not available, use Granny Smith or other tart apple.  You may want to use a little more sugar if using tart apples like Granny Smith that don't have the sweetness of Gravenstein.  If you do not use tart apples, or if the apples are bland and/or lacking in flavor, sprinkle the sliced apples with 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind and 1 teaspoon vanilla.

Line a 9-inch pie pan with pie dough.  Preheat the oven to 450F. Pare, core and thinly slice 6 cups fresh or frozen apples Combine and sift over the apples:

2/3 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoon Minute Tapioca
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Stir the apples gently until they are well coated. Place them in layers in the pie shell. Dot with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter Cover the pie with a pricked upper crust.  Brush the top of the pie crust with milk.  Sprinkle with white sugar before baking.   Bake in a 450F oven until done, 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      small         habanero peppers -- dried
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   1      tablespoon    butter -- optional
   1 1/2  tablespoons   dark brown sugar
  12      whole         golden raisins -- chopped
   3      tablespoons   apricot preserves
   1      teaspoon      white wine vinegar

In a good-sized skillet heat about a half-cup water over medium heat until it begins steaming.  Carefully cut small slices from the dried habanero and finely chop those to accumulate about 1/2 tsp. or so of flakes, adjusting to your taste and heat tolerance.  (You might want to wear rubber gloves when touching the pepper; at least be careful and don't touch your eyes until your hands have been thoroughly washed.) 
Add the pepper flakes with the salt and butter to the water and allow the flakes to soften and the butter to melt. 
Add the brown sugar (stir to dissolve) and raisins.  When the water is simmering, add the apricot preserves.  Cut up any large pieces of apricot in the pan, and make sure all the gelatinous matter is dissolved. 
Add the vinegar a little at a time, being careful not to make the mixture at all sour; the vinegar should just brighten up the taste. Allow the glaze to simmer.  As it thickens, water can be added a bit at a time to keep the glaze from scorching; it should be allowed to darken a bit. 
Coat grilled chops or meat slices with the glaze by simmering the meats with the glaze for a couple minutes on each side.  Spread a teaspoon or so on each serving plate and arrange meats on top.  Little mint sprigs and curls of orange peel could be used to give a truly goofy appearance, if you like that kinda thing.

                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOTES : For grilled meats, paint some of this glaze on both sides of the meat a few minutes before you remove it form the grill.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Rubs And Spices

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   7      cloves        garlic -- chopped very fine
     1/2  cup           parsley -- chopped
     1/2  cup           oregano
     1/4  cup           red dried pepper -- (the Italian type)
   1      cup           boiling water
     1/2  cup           white vinegar
     1/2  cup           olive oil
                        salt to taste
                        black pepper to taste

you need to mix the ingredients in the above order and then (when it cools) to put in a closed jar ( an empty mayonnaise pot is perfect for that) and store in the refrigerator for at least 12 hrs. Is perfect if you prepare the recipe one or two days before the BBQ !! It can be stored in the Refrigerator for 10 or 15 days. You can put on the meat or on the chicken before cooking (where the flavor is stronger) or you can put the sauce on the meat after cooking (the flavor became lighter) Enjoy and thank you for the opportunity. Excuse the poor English.

   2                    bags pita bread

The following appetizer is sure to be a crowd pleaser.  I have never taken it anywhere without being asked for the recipe:

Tear artichokes apart with your fingers.

Cut up pita bread into chip size triangles, separate and bake on a cookie sheet until crispy (approx. 5 minutes).  Combine all other ingredients and mash (a KitchenAid mixer works great).

Bake in a uncovered casserole dish for approx. 30 minutes at 350F or until bubbly.

Serve hot out of the oven and scoop up dip with pita bread.  If  you intend  to take this to a party or are having friends over be prepared to recite this recipe a number of times.  My wife and I bring Xerox copies with us!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4  cup           olive oil
   4      cups          fresh corn kernels -- (5 to 6 ears)
   1      teaspoon      salt
     3/4  teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper
   2                    avocados -- peeled and seeded
   4                    poblano chilies -- roasted, peeled and
                         -- seeded, (see note)
   4                    scallions
     1/2  cup           red wine vinegar

Use only the white and light green parts of the scallions.  Thinly slice on the diagonal.

Saut� the corn with the salt and pepper, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside to cool.

Cut the avocados, bell pepper and roasted poblanos into 1/4 inch dice.  Add to the saut�ed corn along with the scallions, vinegar and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Mix well and let sit 20 to 30 minutes to blend the flavors.

Serve at room temperature.  Corn relish can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator up to 1 day.  To make 2 to 3 days in advance, mix all the ingredients except the avocado and store in the refrigerator.  Add the avocado shortly before serving.  Yield: 6 cups

Note: Fresh chilies and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler.  Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh.  Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes.  (If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits.  Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices.  Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins.

Split, seed and wash jalapeno peppers.  Spread cream cheese in each half of split peppers, either leave in halves *OR* combine the two halves to make a whole popper.  Wrap each half/whole jalapeno with a bacon slice cut in half.  Place each bacon wrapped jalapeno on a cookie sheet. Bake at 250F until bacon is done, cool and serve.(Cheese will boil out if oven is set to high)

This is even better cold the next day!!! I should have posted these for Super bowl Sunday...good with beer, wine and margaritas.

*I have used fat free and low fat cream cheese, the amount varies as to how much cheese each individual likes in their jalapeno.  **I use Turkey bacon for the wrap and it is really good, less fat too.

                              Bagged Sausage

                        ***See Directions***      

I love the unique flavor of aged pork sausage. I have even put the 2 pound plastic wrapped bags of store sausage in the refrigerator for about 3 weeks to let them age. This is probably a risky practice but it has worked in a pinch. The risk with any aged sausage is botulism (literally "sausage sickness", if that gives you a hint). By sealing the casing with fat, anaerobic conditions are created. During natural aging, it is not unusual for meat to be in the "danger zone" at least part of the time. If botulism organisms are present and can out grow the benign aging organisms, a lethal product results. The good news is that both the organism and the toxin are destroyed by ordinary (160F.) cooking temperatures.

Many years ago, my father and grandmother taught me how to make and age bagged sausage. It is hung in the garage or shed or smokehouse for several weeks and the aging conditions are dependent upon the weather, therefore, every batch is a different experience. The trick is to get the full flavor without letting it get too strong. I have never had any spoil. This past winter I accidentally re-discovered the value of smoke as an effective preservative.

Usually, we let the bags hang without smoking. We keep sampling until we like the flavor then freeze what we won't eat within a couple of weeks. Last winter we put up 66 bags weighing 2.5 pounds each! Before they attained a real good flavor, we had a serious cold snap with lows in the single digits. Afraid that the sausage and the meat in cure would freeze, I cut a green hickory tree and built a smoking fire on the dirt floor of the smokehouse. I had a lot of trouble getting the kindling started and threw a few extra oak slabs on to get things hot enough for the hickory to catch. It was too cold to hang around and watch the fire. When I checked on it about three hours later, thick smoke was pouring from the eaves. On opening the doors I found a lively fire, heavy smoke and the temperature was up to 120F. 
The sausage was dripping fat and condensate was dripping from the roof. I managed to keep the fire smoldering for the next two days but I was afraid I had over-stocked during that first day. The sausage had a strong (not unpleasant but definitely dominant) smoke flavor). I sampled sausage over the next month and it was not getting that familiar aged flavor; nor was it going bad. It was very good but not what I was used to. In addition to being an excellent breakfast sausage, it was fantastic on pizza (even dominating anchovies) and made a killer spaghetti sauce. I finally froze most of the bags but kept a few back to see what would happen. It is now June; twenty weeks after we hung the sausage. I still have one bag hanging and one that I am using! There is no sign of spoilage and the taste and aroma is indescribable. I just fried some up to make sure it was still good - it's wonderful; kinda like the best Lebanon raised to the third power! Next year I will try stopping the aging process with smoke after it is ripe.

Bagged Sausage:

     25 lb. Fresh pork sausage, seasoned
     10 Sausage bags

Use only freshly ground seasoned pork sausage. If seasoned with a commercial mix, add extra sage to taste (we test fry samples as we season). Make bags of cotton feed bags or unbleached muslin. Cut rectangles 8" X 16" and stitch bottom and side allowing 1/4" for seams resulting in a 3 3/4" finished bag. Soak bags in water. Stuff sausage by hand and squeeze down hard so as to eliminate air and squeeze fat through bag (some people waxed them). Twist end tight, tie and hang in cool place (smoke house or garage) until distinctive aged flavor develops. Do not allow to freeze during aging. Temperatures should average in mid 30's; 38 is ideal. Weather with lows in upper 20's and highs in low 40's will age sausage in 3 to 4 weeks. If warm, check to see that sausage is not getting too strong or spoiling. May be cold smoked for 24 hours or longer at less than 100F using hickory or apple wood. Always cook aged sausage to well done. Do not wrap in plastic to store in refrigerator because of mold. Seal cut end with grease and store uncovered or hang.

Filling of your choice: cranberry chutney, some sliced cappacolla or Genoa salami, mushroom duxelles, some saut�ed fennel or leek--whatever (except, maybe, peanut butter)

Allow pastry to defrost and roll out a little to be able to completely wrap the Brie in it. Slice Brie in half or in thirds horizontally and put in desired filling. Place in center of pastry and cut off the four corners of the pastry a couple of inches down. You can use these pastry scraps to make decorations for on top. Completely wrap the pastry around the Brie, brushing with beaten egg whenever you put the pastry together. Flip the assembly over and place on parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush top with beaten egg and place on pastry cutouts and brush them with the egg too. Bake at 400F until pastry is golden brown and puffed like it's supposed to. Best if not cut into while it's too hot--or else all the cheese will run out. Serve with water crackers.

Mom's kitchen tip: Ketchups (like mayo) are colloidal suspensions.  If you want the stuff up near the neck of the jar, jerk it a couple - three times towards the neck and it will pile up there handy where is easier to get at.

Serving Size  : 16   Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      each          4 pound chickens -- quartered
     1/4  cup           vegetable oil
   4      teaspoons     thyme
   2      teaspoons     crushed red pepper
                        salt and freshly ground black pepper
                        True Texas Barbecue Sauce

Light a grill, preferably charcoal.  Rub the chicken with the oil and season with the thyme, red pepper, salt and black pepper.  When the fire is medium hot, arrange the chicken, skin side down, on the grill.  Cover and cook, rotating from time to time, so the fat is rendered, about 10 minutes.  Turn the chicken, cover and continue cooking until almost cooked through, about 15 minutes longer.  Uncover and generously spoon the True Texas Barbecue Sauce all over the skin.  Turn the chicken skin side down and grill, basting and turning so it doesn't burn, until the pieces are nicely glazed and slightly charred, about 10 minutes.  Serve hot off the grill.

   1 1/2  teaspoons     black pepper
   1      teaspoon      onion powder
     1/2  teaspoon      white pepper
   1      teaspoon      salt

     1/2  teaspoon      ground cayenne pepper
                        ***MAIN INGREDIENTS***
     1/2  pound         bacon -- minced
   2      cups          pork beef or chicken stock
   1      cup           honey
   5      tablespoons   orange juice -- (1/2 orange)
   2      tablespoons   lemon juice -- (1/4 lemon)
   2      tablespoons   minced garlic
   4      tablespoons   unsalted butter
   1 1/2  cups          chopped onions
   1 1/2  cups          bottled chili sauce
     3/4  cup           dry roasted pecans -- chopped
                        rind and pulp from 1/2 orange
                        rind and pulp from 1/4 lemon
   1      teaspoon      Tabasco sauce

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.  In a 2-quart saucepan fry the bacon over high heat until crisp.  Stir in the onions, cover pan, and continue cooking until onions are dark brown, but not burned, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the seasoning mix and cook about 1 minute. 
Add the stock, chili sauce, honey, pecans, orange juice, lemon juice, orange and lemon rinds and pulp, garlic, and Tabasco, stirring well. Reduce heat to low; continue cooking about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove orange and lemon rinds. 
Continue cooking and stirring about 15 minutes more to let the flavors marry.  Add the butter and stir until melted. 
Remove from heat.  Let cool about 30 minutes, then pour into a food processor or blender and process until pecans and bacon are finely chopped, about 10 to 15 seconds. 
This sauce may be used to barbecue chicken, pork or ribs. 
Makes about 5 Cups.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Misc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4                    alligator tail steaks
                        -- about 3/4" thick
                        milk for marinade

     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper

                        red pepper flakes

  Place milk in a deep bowl, add pepper flakes and rosemary. Season meat with black and cayenne peppers. Place meat in the bowl, add milk as needed to cover. Let marinate 3-4 hours.   Remove meat from marinade, discard marinade. Pat the meat dry. Re-season the meat, if desired, with black and red peppers. Add salt to taste, if desired.   Brush meat with olive oil to reduce sticking, and grill over hot coals, or over medium heat in a gas grill for about 10 minutes each side, brushing with oil again when turning.

                          Barbecued Baked Beans

Recipe By     : The Wide, Wide World of Texas Cooking ISBN 0-517-120089

Categories    : Bbq List                         Beans
                Sides

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          dried Navy or pinto beans
   8      slices        bacon -- diced
     1/2  cup           onion -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   corn syrup
   2      tablespoons   chili powder
   1      small         hot red chile pepper
     3/4  cup           tomato catsup
   2      tablespoons   prepared mustard
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1                    generous dash hot pepper sauce

Soak beans overnight in cold water to cover.  Fry bacon until crisp.  Drain drippings from bacon into baking dish or small bean pot.  Add all remaining ingredients to fat and blend.  Drain beans and add to mixture.  Blend.  Crumble the crisp bacon over top.  Add water just to cover beans.  Cover dish or bean pot and bake at 325F.  for 2 hours.  Add more hot water if needed.  Uncover beans during last 20 to 30 minutes.  Serve from baking dish.

A slice of smoky bacon rind used instead of the sliced bacon will give a more decidedly country flavor.  Brown sugar to taste may replace the corn syrup.  And canned tomatoes may take the place of the catsup -- but if so, correct the seasoning as necessary with a little sugar, salt, cayenne and a pinch of ground allspice.

Remove from grill, thinly slice meat against grain and serve.  Offer any remaining glaze on side.

Serving Size  : 9    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Lamb

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    leg of lamb -- (5-6 lb.)*
     3/4  cup           balsamic vinegar
     1/3  cup           mint jelly
     1/3  cup           minced fresh mint leaves
                        fresh mint sprigs -- optional
                        salt and pepper to taste
          small         pocket bread**

* - boned and trimmed of surface fat ** - or regular pocket bread, cut in half crosswise

1.  Lay meat boned side up.  Slash about halfway through thickest portions, as needed, and pull meat, patting cut edges down, to make the piece relatively even.

2.  Place lamb in a 9x13" pan.  In a 1 1/2 quart pan over medium-high heat, stir vinegar with 1/3 cup mint jelly just until boiling.  Stir in mint and pour evenly over lamb.  Cover and chill 2 hours or up to a day.  Turn meat over occasionally.

3.  On firegrate in a barbecue, with a lid, ignite 50-60 charcoal briquettes.  When briquettes are dotted with ash, in about 30 minutes, spread them into a single layer; scatter 10-12 more briquettes over coals.  Set grill 5-6" above coals.  Lift meat onto grill; reserve marinade.  Put lid on barbecue and open vents.

4.  Turn meat as needed to brown evenly; baste with marinade.  Cook until thickest part of meat is done to your liking; for rare (140' on a thermometer) in center of thickest part, allow about 40 minutes total.  Thinner sections will be well done.

5.  Transfer lamb to a platter and let rest 5-10 minutes.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  Slice meat thin.  Season to taste with mint jelly, salt, and pepper.  Eat with knife and fork or tuck into pocket bread.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   9      pounds        goose -- rinsed, patted dry
   2      teaspoons     salt
   8      ounces        herb-seasoned stuffing cubes
   1 1/2  cups          water
     1/2  cup           brandy
     1/4  pound         butter -- (1 stick)
   2                    tangerines, peeled, sectioned
   1      stalk         celery -- thinly sliced
     3/4  cup           pitted prunes -- quartered
     1/2  cup           raisins
                        vegetable oil -- for rubbing

Place the goose on a flat work surface and remove all loose fat.  Sprinkle the cavity with 1 teaspoon salt; set aside.  Prepare the herbed bread stuffing according to  package directions, using 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup brandy and butter.  Once the stuffing is thoroughly moistened, stir in the tangerines, celery, prunes and raisins; stir well to distribute the fruit evenly.  spoon the mixture into the body cavity, using up any remaining to fill in the neck cavity.  Close both ends of the goose with skewers and place in a pan.  Pierce the skin of the goose all over with the tines of a fork.  Rub the skin all over lightly with vegetable oil before, not during, barbecuing.  Rub the remaining salt on the skin.  Set a drip pan in the center of the coals.  Place the goose on a rack directly over the pan.  Using a medium-slow wood or charcoal fire, cooking time will be between 2 3/4  to 3 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the goose, and the heat of the fire.  The goose is done when the joints move freely.  Remove the goose from the grill and set on a platter to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

                     Barbecued Ham - Ala Starzingers

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Ham

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      each          cured ham -- about 7 pounds
   1      tablespoon    cinnamon
   1      teaspoon      dry mustard
   1      tablespoon    ginger
     1/2  teaspoon      cloves -- ground
   2      ounces        JD sour mash whiskey
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar
     1/2  teaspoon      molasses
     2/3  cup           wine vinegar
                        pineapple juice

Make your fire of prune or fruit wood, approximately two or three inches in diameter, and enough charcoal to keep the bed of coals at an even heat.  If ham still has some of the rind, cut it off.  Leave fat on and score.

Place ham in cooker, and cook it about the same length of time you would bake it (follow directions on label for the type of ham you have).  Baste ham as it cooks.  The outside fat will char black, but don't let that worry you.  Just don't let it burn.  Keep the fire constant.

When ham is done, break off charred fat with a knife.  Put back on cooker for another 10 or 15 minutes and use up remainder of basting sauce.  Remove ham, cut off excess fat, slice, and serve.....

Basting Sauce:

Place the cinnamon, mustard, ginger, and cloves in a mortar, or small jar, and cover with the whisky.  (The alcohol will dissolve the essential oils, and that's what gives the flavor).  Let set for an hour or so.  Put the brown sugar, molasses, and vinegar in a pint jar.  Grind the spices with a pestle, or stir well, and add to the vinegar-sugar solution.  Pour in enough pineapple juice to make a pint.  Stir well.

Now your are ready to paint your ham.  Mix the sauce each time you baste, so that the spices are evenly distributed.  Don't leave any dregs in the jar, put them all on the ham to get the full, spicy flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4  pounds        ground meat
   1                    egg
   2      tablespoons   finely chopped onion
   1      tablespoon    soy sauce
   1      tablespoon    tomato ketchup
   2      tablespoons   half-half
   1      tablespoon    cornstarch
                        ***BASTING SAUCE***
     1/2  cup           ketchup
     1/4  cup           water
   1      tablespoon    lemon juice
   1      tablespoon    brown sugar
   1      tablespoon    Worcestershire sauce
   1      dash          hot pepper sauce


Stir to blend well.  Add dash salt and black pepper.  In a large mixing bowl, combine ground meat, egg and onion.  Add soy sauce, and ketchup.  Mix half and half and cornstarch.  Add to meat mixture, mixing to blend well.  Form portions of meat to even, rather thick meat patties.  Place patties on preheated barbecue grill.  Broil 3 to 4 inches from source of heat, basting with sauce and turning patties over from time to time for even browning.  Grill 12-15 minutes total or to your liking- time depends on how well you like your meat done.  Serve meat patties on hamburger buns, if you like, or with French Fries.

                Barbecued Ribs (Four Great Southern Cooks)

Recipe By     : William Mann, Jr.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        pork spareribs
                        salted water
     1/2  cup           butter
   1      medium        onion -- finely chopped
   1      cup           water
     1/2  cup           vinegar
   1      cup           ketchup
   1      cup           BBQ sauce, hickory smoke flavor
                        juice from one lemon
                        salt to taste
                        fresh ground black pepper
                        Tabasco sauce

Slice the ribs apart and place in a large cast iron skillet. Cover with
salted water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer over low
heat for one hour, or until the meat is fork tender but not falling from
the bones.

While the ribs are cooking, prepare the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan and saut� the finely chopped onion. Stir in the water, vinegar, catsup, bottled sauce, lemon juice, and seasonings. Bring to a boil, stirring, and remove from heat.

Place the ribs in a shallow pan and cover with the sauce, coating the ribs evenly. Place in the refrigerator for at least two hours.

Barbecue the ribs on an outdoor grill over moderately hot coals, basting
with the sauce and turning often until well browned.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00

   2      cups          soy sauce
   1      cup           water
   4      tablespoons   chopped ginger
   3      cloves        garlic coarsely chopped
   2      racks         pork ribs

Combine the soy sauce, water, ginger and garlic in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn off heat and let cool. Place ribs in a large roasting dish. Cover with the marinade and let marinate in refrigerator for 24 hours.

Remove ribs from marinade. Grill the ribs turning and brushing with the sauce until cooked through.

[Bill's comment: I think these ribs would be better if smoked after marinating.  Also remove the membrane from the bone side of the ribs before marinating.]

                           Barbecued Short Ribs

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 4    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ribs                             Bbq List

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      pounds        short ribs -- (or chicken)
   2      cups          chicken broth
   2      cups          water (enough to barely cover ribs)
   1      tablespoon    brown sugar
     1/4  cup           cider vinegar
     1/4  cup           catsup
   2      tablespoons   tomato paste
   1      tablespoon    dry mustard
   1      teaspoon      Worcestershire sauce
     1/4  teaspoon      ground cloves
   1      teaspoon      chili powder
     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper

The day before grilling the ribs, put the sugar and vinegar in a pot large enough to hold the ribs and place over medium heat on top of the stove. 
 Cook until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the sugar, about 8 minutes.  Watch carefully, as the syrup will suddenly darken in color.  Immediately add the broth, water, catsup, tomato paste, mustard, Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and pepper and bring to a boil.  Add the ribs and cook 20 minutes.  (If using chicken, cook for 10 minutes.)

 Remove from heat, remove the ribs from the liquid and place covered in the refrigerator.  Cook the liquid over medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy. 
The next day, light a charcoal grill.  Place the ribs on the grill so they are not directly over the coals and cover the grill so that smoke collects inside. 
If your grill does not have a cover, improvise one out of aluminum foil.  Cook for 40 minutes, basting with barbecue sauce every 10 minutes.  When ribs are well heated, remove to a platter and serve.  Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side.

1.  Pound steak on both sides with a wooden mallet or the edge of a heavy plate.

2.  Combine lemon juice and mustard and spread over both sides of steak.  Allow to stand 4-5 hours at room temperature.

3.  Broil steaks about 4 inches above glowing coals on barbecue grill for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until desired degree of doneness is achieved.  You won't taste the lemon juice or mustard as such - just a very good and flavorful steak.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00

   4      tablespoons   cumin
   4      tablespoons   thyme
   4      tablespoons   garlic powder
   4      tablespoons   black pepper -- freshly ground
   2      tablespoons   cayenne pepper
   2      tablespoons   salt
   2      tablespoons   curry powder
   1      tablespoon    onion powder
   1      tablespoon    MSG or other flavor enhancer -- optional

In a small bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine all the ingredients.  Stir or shake to mix.  Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place for several months.

This rub is pretty strong and so I do not recommend it for thin cuts (like ribs).  Bit it is swell on heavier cuts of meat such as beef round, prime rib, pork shoulders, and even the whole hog.  With this recipes, you have enough for five shoulders or four hams.  Best if you let the meat marinate, loosely covered, in the refrigerator for a good twenty-four to forty-eight hours after being rubbed.

   6      pounds        beef chuck ribs
                        -- cut into 1 rib pieces
   1      cup           water
     3/4  cup           soy sauce
     2/3  cup           dry sherry

   1      tablespoon    ground red pepper
   1      tablespoon    fresh grated ginger
   2      teaspoons     Chinese five spice powder

Trim excess fat from ribs.  In large roasting pan, arrange ribs in single layer.  For marinade, in medium saucepan combine remaining ingredients.  Cook over medium heat on range top until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat; cool slightly.  Pour marinade over ribs.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator for at least 1 hour, turning ribs once.

Cover roasting pan with foil.  Arrange medium hot briquettes around drip pan.  Place roasting pan on grill, cover grill and cook ribs 45 minutes.  Remove ribs from roasting pan and place directly on grid; reserve marinade.  Continue cooking in covered grill, 45 to 60 minutes longer or until ribs are tender, turning occasionally.  Brush ribs again with reserved marinade during last 10 minutes of grilling.

                       Barbequed Chicken - Craig's

Recipe By     : Craig Edmundson
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    split fryer chicken
                        white vinegar
                        ***RUB***
   5      teaspoons     salt
   2      teaspoons     dry mustard
   2      teaspoons     coarse grind garlic powder
   2      teaspoons     cracked black pepper
   2      teaspoons     MSG
   1      teaspoon      crushed thyme
   1      teaspoon      celery salt
     1/2  teaspoon      dried ground lemon peel

I let a split fryer sit in white vinegar for twenty minutes or so, turning a few times. Next I coated the halves with olive oil. Then I sprinkled on this rub (makes plenty for one split fryer).

I let the chicken stand in the fridge for a good hour before cooking
on the Weber with a combination of charcoal and hickory (plain tap water in the drip pan.) I personally thought it was a tad bit on the salty side, but the family said it was fine. Must have been me. Next time I might back off some on the plain salt and the garlic powder and make up the difference with Lawry's (Coarse Ground with Parsley) Garlic Salt, which I happen to like a lot.

Lay the rabbit in salt and water half an hour, scald with boiling water, wipe dry, grease with butter, and sprinkle with pepper and a little salt. Lay it on the gridiron, turning often so that it may cook through and through, without becoming hard and dry.  When brown, lay on a hot dish, butter plentifully on both sides, and add a little salt and pepper.  Set in the oven, while preparing four teaspoonfuls of vinegar, one of made mustard, and one of currant jelly or brown sugar.  Pour this over the rabbit, rubbing it in, then pour over the gravy and serve hot.

NOTES : The short of it is that BBQ has been with us since the dawn of man.  BBQ as a conscious act, not just as the way to cook, is older than the 40's. The book I mentioned earlier, Housekeeping in Old Virginia (1879) specifically mentions Barbecue.  See above for an example.

     1/2  pound         medium shrimp
   1      pound         boneless chicken breast

Peel shrimp and cut chicken into 1 inch cubes.  Combine Garlic, Onion powder, Cumin and melted Butter.  Marinate shrimp and chicken while preparing grill.  String shrimp and chicken onto separate skewers.  Cook about 5 inches above hot coals, allowing 5 minutes for shrimp and 10 minutes for chicken.  Turn once or twice while cooking and baste often with remaining marinade.

The shrimp are done when they have turned from pink to white.  Chicken is done when it is white throughout and if pierced with a toothpick, the escaping juices are clear.  Please be careful and do not over cook either of these delicious bite-sized treats.

   4      large         onions -- chopped

   2 1/2  cups          white vinegar

   8      tablespoons   brown mustard -- Dijon-style

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, saut� the onion in the oil over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Add all the remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered at the lowest possible heat for 4 hours. (This long cooking removes as much acidity as possible from the tomatoes.)

Puree sauce in 2, 3, or more batches to prevent it from spilling out of your food processor or blender.

Will keep 2 weeks, covered, in the refrigerator.

                            Basic Arepa Dough

Recipe By     : Denver Post - Vista Magazine
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Bread, Rolls And Cornbread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      Cups          pre-cooked masa flour (yellow or white)
   1      Teaspoon      salt
   3      Cups          water -- boiling
                        butter -- softened

Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn tortillas were to the Aztecs.

Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela continued to use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of nourishment. Today, these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for the rich and poor alike, a heart-warming tribute to simplicity, tradition, versatility, and good taste.

Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained and ground into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a pre-cooked harina de masa is now available at most Latin American markets. An instant masa can be made by simply mixing this corn flour (either white or yellow) with a little salt and enough boiling water to make a stiff dough.

The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses, depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried. In parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is first heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty -- arepas de chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of banana leaves.

Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan counterparts. The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a flat bread roll, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. They can be split open and buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh goat cheese. Made this way, they are served for breakfast or as an accompaniment for grilled fowl, fish, meat stews, or sausages.

In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the shell is filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef, ham, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or beans. They are excellent first courses. Venezuelan mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped into rings and deep-fried. Another specialty is bollos pelones -- balls of arepa dough stuffed with seasoned ground meat, either fried or poached in water, then served with tomato sauce.

A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh cheese and fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups using fresh masa or leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great desserts.

The versatile arepa indeed proves that unpretentious food can be not only satisfying but also delicious.

Directions:

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add water, stir with a
wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 minutes, then knead for 3 minutes. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard arepas, or to be mixed and kneaded with other ingredients such as cheese, chicharrones (pork rind), etc.

To shape arepas: The standard Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick. Colombian arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 inch thick. To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and shape dough into balls. Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc.

To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat;
grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of times until a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be served at this point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to be baked in a preheat 350F oven for 15 minutes. To check for doneness, tap the arepa lightly -- if a hollow sound is heard, it's ready. Split open, add butter and serve hot.

Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm. Freeze in layers separated by plastic wrap.  Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum foil in a preheated 350F oven for 10 minutes or until heated through.

NOTES : A traditional American sauce that has a nice balance of sweet, tart, and spice. Because the sauce contains sugar, it burns easily, and is best brushed on food just during the last 5 or 10 minutes of cooking. Pass the remaining sauce at the table.

   1      quart         water

Fill a large container with 1/2 quart of warm water. Add salt and sugar. Mix thoroughly until well dissolved. Add the remaining 1/2 quart of water.

Immerse prepared fish chunks, filets or small whole fish completely in brine solution. Refrigerate fish in brine solution. Brine chunks of fish of fish 1" thick for about 5 up to 8 hours, 1/2" thick for about 4 hours, and for thinner filets or pieces 2-3 hours.

After brining, always rinse your fish with plenty of fresh water. Pat the fish dry, and allow them to air dry for about 1 hour. This will cause a "pellicle" (a tacky glaze on the fish) to form indicating that it is ready for the drying and smoking process.

   2      Cups          uncooked rice
   2 1/2  cups          chicken stock
   1 1/2  tablespoons   onion -- very finely chopped
   1 1/2  tablespoons   celery -- very finely chopped
   1 1/2  tablespoons   green bell pepper -- very finely chopped
   1 1/2  tablespoons   unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/8  teaspoon      garlic powder

          pinch         cayenne pepper
          pinch         black pepper

If you make this ahead of time and store it, omit the bell peppers -- they  tend to sour quickly. Use chicken stock if you are serving the rice with a chicken dish, seafood stock with a seafood dish, beef with a beef dish...

In a 5x9/2 1/2 inch loaf pan, combine all ingredients; mix well. Seal pan snugly with aluminum foil. Bake at 350F until rice is tender, about 1 hour, 10 minutes. Serve immediately. However, you can count on the rice staying hot for 45 minutes and warm for 2 hours. To reheat leftover rice, either use a double boiler or warm the rice in a skillet with unsalted butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          flour
   1      teaspoon      salt
   3      teaspoons     baking powder
   1      cup           water

Mix ingredients and let sit for 10-15 minutes.

Break off a ball of dough about golf ball size and pat out no thicker than 1/4 inch.  (In some tribal traditions a hole is always made in the center which has spiritual significance)

Fry in deep hot oil to a light golden brown, turn once to brown both sides.  (Oil is hot enough if a small test piece of dough dropped in the oil begins cooking almost immediately and rises to the top.) Drain bread well and pat with paper towel to remove excess oil.  Keep covered in a bowl while cooking to keep bread warm.

Serving - Usually eaten like bread with soup, stew or posole

Variations - Eat with honey, powdered sugar, cinnamon.  Also good with strawberries and whipped cream

                             Basic Meat Brine

Recipe By     : Bob Pastorio
Serving Size  : 0    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Brines

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      quart         water
   4      tablespoons   sugar
   3      tablespoons   kosher salt
   1      tablespoon    black pepper
   1      teaspoon      thyme
   2      teaspoons     oregano
   4                    bay leaves -- crumbled (4 to 5)
   4      cloves        garlic -- smashed
   2      tablespoons   vinegar

Heat the water and add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a low simmer, stir a few times and remove from the heat. Let cool. That's the brine. How to use it? One very easy way is a gallon freezer bag. Put the meat in the bag and pour the cooled brine over it. Squeeze out much of the air, put the bag in a container and refrigerate. Just in case of leaks. Chicken pieces benefit from the juice of a lemon and a tablespoon of rubbed sage added to the brine.

NOTES : This much brine will take care of a 3 or 4 pound piece of pork loin, a chicken (or chicken pieces), a 3 or 4 pound beef, lamb or veal roast. How long to leave the meats in the brine?  Depends.  For poultry, at least 24 hours.  Up to about 36 hours.  Roasts benefit from 3 days or more.

   4      cups          water
   1      tablespoon    unsalted butter
   1 1/2  cups          coarse yellow cornmeal
   1                    bay leaf
   2      tablespoons   coarse salt

In a medium cast-iron saucepan or other heavy pot, bring all ingredients except cornmeal to simmer over medium heat. Very slowly, begin to sift cornmeal into the pan through the fingers of one hand, stirring constantly with wooden spoon or whisk. Gradually sift remaining meal into the pan, continue to stir and reduce heat to medium low. Continue to stir until the polenta is smooth and thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan as it is stirred, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf, pour polenta into a serving bowl or onto a wooden board, and allow it to rest 10 minutes. To serve from the bowl, dip a large spoon into water and scoop polenta onto individual dishes, dipping the spoon into the water between scoops. To serve from the board, cut polenta into segments with a thin, taut string or knife and transfer to plates with a spatula or cake knife.

        Basic Preparation Of Pig Heads, Feet, Tails, Ears, Snouts

Recipe By     :

                        ***See Directions***      

Step I: Cleaning

Remove any hairs on heads, feet, tails, ears or snouts by singeing over an open flame or plucking. Scrub well (using a vegetable brush if desired) and then sprinkle with salt, rubbing it into the skin. Rinse well with cool water; pat dry Remove any excess fat. Poultry feet (chicken, duck or turkey) must be stripped of their outer scaly skin; plunge them in boiling water for 1 minute, as you would do before peeling tomatoes. Proceed with recipe.

Step II: Parboiling

Parboil in salted water (1 teaspoon salt for each quart water) for 5 minutes. Drain, discarding water. This step serves the propose of ridding the meat of running blood as well as clinging meat, fat or bone residue, thereby adding clarity to sauces.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           all-purpose flour
   1      cup           cooking oil

Heat oil in heavy pot or Dutch Oven.  When oil is hot, gradually
add flour, stirring constantly until well mixed.  Lower flame and continue stirring until chocolate brown.  When roux is chocolate brown, removed from pot and set aside.  If roux remains in the pot it will continue to cook and get too dark.

Always use warm water to dissolve the roux.

While you're at it, make more than enough as it keeps well in or out of the refrigerator.

P.S.  The darker the roux the more intense the taste.  I prefer mine the color of peanut butter.

After a couple of rounds of turkey sandwiches (squishy store bread, mayonnaise, sliced white meat, salt and pepper, lettuce, potato chips on side and cola over ice) there is nothing left but carcass. Throw it into a soup pot along with just about anything organic and simmer until the bones are clean. My wife just informed me that there really is a procedure! She cooks the carcass along with celery and onions, then removes the vegetables and bones for a relatively clear soup - variations are endless! Season as you like.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 3/4  pounds        boneless leg of lamb
                        ***FOR THE MARINADE***
   2      cups          fresh pomegranate juice
   1      small         onion -- grated
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
     1/4  cup           extra virgin olive oil
     1/4  cup           fresh cilantro -- chopped
   1                    bay leaf -- crushed
   1      teaspoon      ground coriander
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        salt
                        lemon wedges for serving

Cut the lamb into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off excess fat or sinew.
(Leave a little fat intact.)

Prepare the marinade.  To juice a fresh pomegranate, cut it in half and press it on a citrus reamer.  Strain juice into a large  non-reactive bowl. Stir in the remaining marinade ingredients.  Add the lamb and marinate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

Thread lamb onto skewers and season with salt and pepper.  Build the fire and let it die down to embers. Oil the grill.  Rake a 1-inch layer of glowing coals beneath it. Generously season the kebabs with salt; grill, basting with any excess marinade, until the lamb is cooked to taste, 4 to 6 minutes per side.  Transfer the kebabs to a platter, sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.

NOTES : In the Republic of Georgia, basturma is a sort of shish kebab (Elsewhere in the Near East, the term refers to spiced dried meat and is etymologically related to our word pastrami.) Georgians love the combination of fruit and meat with pomegranate juice as a common seasoning.  If you can't find fresh pomegranates, use pomegranate syrup (sometimes called pomegranate molasses), which is sold in Middle East and Armenian markets.  This recipe comes from my friend, Darra Goldstein, author of The Georgian Feast (Harper Collins).

     1/3  cup           soy sauce
   3      tablespoons   honey

   2                    broiler-fryer chickens
                        -- quartered, or cut up

For Sesame-Chili Sauce, in a small saucepan combine all of the ingredients except chicken.  Cook over medium heat till bubbly, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels.  If desired, remove skin from chicken and discard.  If using quartered chickens, break wing, hip, and drumstick joints so the bird will lie flat during cooking.  Twist wing tips under backs.

Place chicken, skin side down, on an uncovered grill directly over MEDIUM coals.  Grill for 20 minutes.  Turn; grill 15 to 25 minutes more or till tender and no longer pink.  Brush with sauce frequently during the last 10 minutes of grilling.

Transfer chicken to a serving platter.  Heat any remaining sauce either on the grill or stove top; pass with chicken.

Make-ahead tip: The Sesame-Chili Sauce can be made up to 5 days ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4                    frozen pie shells -- thawed
   1 1/4  pounds        pulled pork
   4      medium        potatoes -- diced
   1      large         onion -- chopped
     1/4  cup           rutabaga -- diced
   1                    carrot diced
     1/2  tablespoon    sage
     1/2  tablespoon    thyme
                        salt and pepper

Mix all ingredients and put 1/4 in each pie shell. Fold the pastry over the filling to make half-moon shaped pies. Seal the edges and cut a couple of small slits on the top. Bake on a cookie sheet at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F and bake 15 more minutes.

I just replaced the meat in the pasty recipe with pulled pork. It gave it a nice smokiness and with the BBQ sauce, it was great. I like flaky crusts and hate rolling pastry dough, so I use frozen pie shells. I get one pasty out of each shell. This makes 4 pasties. Serve with BBQ sauce and a Stroh's.

   2      teaspoons     garlic pepper
   1      teaspoon      dry marjoram leaves
   1      teaspoon      chili powder

Try this recipe for BBQ'd venison. The wine is used to add flavor and also tenderize the meat. If you need to tie the roast to keep it together, then do that. I always do. Mix the brine ingredients in a NON-METAL container, add the meat, the keep in the fridge for up to 48 hours. You need to turn it over several times during the marinating period. After 48 hours drain the brine, pat dry with paper towels, and air-dry for 2 hours.

Smoke in the pit 4-5 hours.

   1      gallon        Texas Pete or Crystal hot sauce

     1/4  cup           fresh ground pepper
     1/2  jar           Marie's Bleu Cheese dressing -- up to 3/4
                        salt to taste
  40      pounds        chicken wings

Cut the chicken wings up into the drumette, the middle section and the tip. Discard tips or make into stock. Deep fry the wings until the outside is chewy. You can flour the wings if ya want a lil' crust. Wings should be safely edible at this point. In a pot melt the butter add everything but the bleu cheese dressing. Bring mixture up to a good simmer add the dressing. Cook until cheese lumps dissolve to an even texture (you can still have small bb size or bigger lumps). The addition of more or less dressing will increase or decrease the heat of the wings to a point. If ya want it hotter add some habaneros, it's your life.

You want to now sauce the wings. You can do this in a Tupperware bowl. Put in some wings and sauce and put on the lid and shake. You can do them by dipping them individually into the sauce with tongs. You can do them in a medium bag, or in a garbage can or garbage bag all at once. You get the idea--coat the wings with sauce.

The smoker should be going. I also did this for years on the Brinkmann bullet (no water pan, grill on top of the charcoal pan at lowest height). Put in the wings at 200 to 300F and smoke with mesquite wood until sauce it totally adhered to the wings. You can touch them without getting a sauce-covered finger.

Serve with Bleu cheese dressing (Marie's is the best I've had) for dipping. I don't bother cutting up no damn celery.

   1      large         whole salmon -- cut into steaks

Mix all the dry items for rub.

Lay out a piece of plastic wrap long enough to wrap both filets well. Lay a filet scales down 5 inches up from the bottom of the wrap (lengthwise so the ends are left open). Pack all the "rub" on top of the filet. Lay the other side face down into the "rubbed" fish". You should now have the semblance of a sugar stuffed fishy.

Flip the bottom of the wrap up over the top of the fish and wrap it tightly (leaving the ends open).

Put on a cookie rack (or some such) in a baking dish and in the refrigerator. Let sit for 24 hours. Brown water will roll out of the ends that you left open.

Remove from wrap and scrape off excess rub. Let stand and air dry for 3 hours.

Smoke at 160F for 2-4 hours (when it starts to flake apart with a fork, it's done). I like to use cherry wood this.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      8 pound       Beef Brisket
                        All-South Barbeque Rub

Well, I fixed my first brisket this past weekend.  Thanks to all BBQ list folks for the helpful suggestions and recipes that made this endeavor a success.  Most recommendations to me, posts and e-mail, were centered on the importance of slicing the brisket against the grain. Bear suggested baked beans for a side dish and I fixed that.  I had some input from the southwestern part of the US on side dishes, but, unfortunately, many of the ingredients necessary for these recipes are not available here in WV.

Here is the way I did it:  7:00 AM Friday morning.  Unwrapped the brisket (8 lbs.) and washed it down.  Rubbed in the "All South Rub," not too heavy, and as per suggestions of Dwight's recent post, put his heavy coating of brown sugar to it.  On to the H20, gas fired bullet smoker at 8:00 AM. Adjusted the flame as low as possible + a bit.  One big, fist sized chunk of (1 hour soaked ) hickory. Water pan full. Put on the brisket, fat side up.

At about 12:00 noon I checked it out and found that the water level was OK. and added, and maybe I'll not do this again,  added another big chunk of hickory. Checked the water level again at 3:00. It was OK. At 5:00 PM (10 hours later) I took it off and put in a roaster pan with about a half cup of water. It was a nice brown color. Capped off the roaster pan with aluminum foil and put it in the refrigerator. That's it for day one.     LAZY - Q,  huh?  Saturday. 
8:00 AM . In the oven at 185F until 6:00 PM then took it out to cool for slicing. Yes, my mouth is watering from the aromas in the kitchen. By the way, in the mid-afternoon, I fixed a barbeque sauce, to serve on the side with the brisket. See Carey Starzinger's BBQ sauce. 
Now, at 6:30 sharp, the totally unexpected, drop-in guests from out-of-town hit the door, drank all of our beer and stayed until 11:30. At this time, 6:30 PM, just to be sociable, I quit drinking beer, so they could have it and I switch to scotch. At about 8:30, when I was finally able to face the handwriting on the wall, and still fairly sober, I did manage to refrigerate the complete dinner and kept on smiling at the guests. Oh yes, I did invite them to have dinner with us, but was declined. So we hit the sack hungry and a little grumpy.

Sunday. 4:00 PM. Take the brisket, the beans, the dipping sauce out of the refrigerator and let them warm up on the counter for about a hour. Pre-heat the oven to 175 and put in the brisket at 5:30. I finally serve it at 7:00 and it is perfect! Finding the grain is no problem. 
You can cut this baby with a fork. If I made a mistake any mistakes at all, I might cut back on that last chunk of hickory. It was just a bit more smoky than necessary, so the wife suggested. I agree. I like a light smoke taste.

Anyway, if you have a water smoker, don't believe that you can't fix a respectable brisket. Go for it.

   1      4 pound       beef brisket
                        Sam Higgins' Gud Sauce

That brisket came out so well, I almost cried. I knew that I had done well when I sliced through the blackened crust. As I went through what was left of the cap of fat, it bathed the meat below with just a touch more of delicious moistness. The meat was absolutely beautiful with a dark outside enclosing a picture perfect ring of pink. The meat just fell apart as I loaded it onto the sandwiches. After tasting it, I was initially speechless, then I set into an extended period of raving and eating.

Here's how I did it:

I got my meat from Sam's Club rather than a supermarket--4.3 pound half brisket. They don't trim their brisket there, so it had a good cap of fat on the top.

I applied a good layer of dry rub shortly before cooking--I usually don't give meats a real long time with the rub ahead of time. I built a fire to one side of the grill with the lump charcoal, and put an aluminum half pan of water on the other side to give a little humidity and catch the drippings (but not to produce steam). I put the meat on the grill to the opposite of the fire, and adjusted the vents so that the temp. on the dome cover read 250F for about an hour, then lowered it to about 230-240 for the rest of the cook. (This is what the thermometer read, I'm sure the meat was cooking a touch cooler.) I threw on a few large chips of mesquite from time to time, along with a few more chunks of the lump charcoal.

I gave it a bit over 11 hours on the grill, then took it off, wrapped it in foil, and held it at about 150F for a bit over an hour.

Sliced it across the grain, loaded it up on toasted buns and topped it with a modified version of Sam Higgins's Gud Sauce.

Next time, I will tone down the rub a little, and take it off a little sooner (or use a bigger piece of brisket), but if I say so myself, this was damn near perfection.

     1/2  teaspoon      lemon pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      sausage seasoning
     1/2  teaspoon      thyme
     1/2  teaspoon      oregano
     1/2  teaspoon      marjoram
     1/2  teaspoon      basil

Combine the spices in a dish.  Cut the meat into strips less than 1/4 of an inch thick.  Remove ALL fat.  Sprinkle one side with the combined seasonings and beat with a meat hammer.  Turn and repeat the seasoning and beating.  Place the strips on a cookie sheet or other flat pan.  Place in a 120 F oven for 4 hrs.  Turn and put back for another 4 hrs.  Keep the oven door propped open for the entire time to allow the moisture to escape.  With a gas oven, the pilot light may be enough to provide the heat.  Store in a plastic bag.  Also may be stored in a pillowcase.  Do not store in a paper bag.

                        Beef Jerky - Richard Thead

                        beef

I attended the school of hard knocks when it came to jerky on the smoker.  I found that the key is to not try to completely dry the meat in the smoker.  If you do, the meat will be so smoky that no one will be able to go near it.

I like to spread out the meat, and smoke at less than 150F, rotating the meat strips as they smoke.  I smoke it for around 3 hours, and then finish it in a dehydrator.

Once, I had some too smoky jerky.  My wife and I were volunteering at a local Ladies PGA golf tourney.  My wife wanted to take some snacks, and put the jerky in one Ziploc and some cashews in another.  After several hours in close proximity in the back pack, even though they were separated by plastic, the cashews were inedible.  I won't even tell you about the guy who left some in his desk drawer over the weekend.

Go light on the smoke.

   3      pounds        flank steak - or London broil
                        ***MARINADE***
     1/2  cup           light soy sauce
   4 1/2  tablespoons   honey
   4 1/2  tablespoons   dry sherry
   6      large         garlic cloves - minced
   1 1/2  tablespoons   ginger - fresh -- minced
   1 1/2  tablespoons   sesame oil
   1 1/2  tablespoons   red pepper - crushed
   2      tablespoons   freshly ground white pepper

Cut meat in half lengthwise and slice diagonally crosswise into paper-thin strips 1-1/2 to 2 inches wide and 4 inches long.  Transfer to shallow pan.  Combine marinade ingredients and rub thoroughly into meat.  Arrange meat on racks and let dry at cool room temperature overnight (do not refrigerate).  Preheat oven to 250F.  Line two large baking sheets with foil and set wire rack(s) on top of each.  Arrange meat on racks in single layer.  Bake 30 minutes.  Reduce heat to 175F and continue drying meat another 40 minutes (meat should be lightly browned but not burned).  Let meat continue to dry on racks at cool room temperature overnight before packing into jars.  Dried meat can be brushed lightly with sesame oil for additional flavor and shine.

   5      pounds        beef -- (roast)
     1/4  cup           soy sauce
   1      tablespoon    Worcestershire sauce
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
   1      teaspoon      onion powder
   1      teaspoon      black pepper, cracked
                        red pepper flakes -- optional
   1      tablespoon    Liquid Smoke

I make Jerky by buying about 5+ lbs. of beef.  Usually a roast.  I then remove the fat.  Place the strips of meat into marinade and let soak for about 24 hours.  Remove from marinade and allow to air dry for at least one hour.  If you have a meat smoker then omit the liquid smoke and smoke meat at a low temperature.

   1      tablespoon    chili powder
   3      cups          water

Fill a large container with water. Add ingredients. Mix thoroughly until well dissolved.

Immerse prepared fish chunks, filets or small whole fish completely in brine solution. Refrigerate fish in brine solution. Brine chunks of fish of fish 1" thick for about 5 up to 8 hours, 1/2" thick for about 4 hours, and for thinner filets or pieces 2-3 hours.

After brining, always rinse your fish with plenty of fresh water. Pat the fish dry, and allow them to air dry for about 1 hour. This will cause a "pellicle" (a tacky glaze on the fish) to form indicating that it is ready for the drying and smoking process.

Try using Hickory or Mesquite wood chips with this brine when smoking your fish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      quart         v8 juice
   1      quart         beef stock -- (de-greased)
     1/2  cup           yellow mustard
     1/2  cup           apple cider
   1      cup           dark molasses
     1/3  cup           black pepper
     1/3  cup           Hungarian sweet paprika -- fresh
     1/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   1                    big yellow onion minced
   1      cup           hatch NM chilies or any mild chilies
                        -- roasted and peeled -- minced
     1/2  cup           pressed garlic

Mix together V8 juice and beef stock. Then add mustard, cider, molasses, black pepper and paprika as you stir the sauce. Put mixture on stove to simmer. After 1/2 hour, add Worcestershire sauce, minced yellow onion, chilies, and garlic. Let the sauce simmer for about 2 hours in your smoker to pick up the good smoke taste. Stir and taste often as it simmers. After about three hours total simmering time, taste and add some salt if needed. If you want it hotter, add some Louisiana Hot Sauce. You can put it in a blender to smooth it out. Let the sauce cool and put it in a gallon jug and let age at least a week in the refrigerator before using.

Serve on the side with brisket, ribs, chicken or over steak.

                        ***See Directions***      

I buy 8 to 12 pound cryovac Briskets the morning before I am cooking I  cut a small hole in the sack and pour into it about a cup to cup half of Willingham Marinade and a 1/4 cup of Balsamic Vinegar and about two cups of Dr Pepper.

Cover the hole with Duct Tape, Refrigerate for 24 hours turning and rubbing it about each four hours, next morning open sack and remove Brisket and pat dry, let set in air for about a half hour and then rub it good with Willingham Dry Rub and let set till fire in ol barrel is ready, until I can hold my hand over the grill for a minute to minute half put brisket on fat side up and after about four hours.  Turn it over and add some more coals if needs.  Check about each hour and try to keep heat about the same after four hours turn fat side back up and if you wish you may then make a mop sauce of beer, DR Pepper and red pepper and mop each 30 or 45 minutes for next two or three hours, remove brisket and let cool and firm up so it will slice nice, I like it dry, but some folks want it wet, so we use a Texas Tomato base sauce or Willingham BBQ Sauce or any one of 1/2 hundred more sauces out there, oh yes a time or two I have used
some of that there Yankee sauces too, Father forgive me.

     1/2  cup           lime juice -- (fresh)

I sub Worcestershire for soy and lemon for lime sometimes.

Sounds like you only got part of the whole brisket. Probably has very little fat on it. You should either get some beef fat from the market or else drape the meat you have with bacon to keep it from drying out. Also use a spray of 50/50 oil and either Dr Pepper or lemon juice every hour or so to keep the meat from drying out too much. Next time look for a whole packer trimmed brisket. Weight should run from 7 to 15 lbs. with a good fat cap. It will do better with the long cooking times for low and slow. Also go to http://members.tripod.com/~DanGill/Survive.HTML and read the BBQ List's FAQ. It has almost everything you need to know.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      Slabs         baby back pork ribs -- membranes removed
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
                         -- Dry Rub --
   3      tablespoons   brown sugar
   1      tablespoon    onion powder
   2      teaspoons     chili powder
   1      teaspoon      dry mustard
   1      teaspoon      salt
                         -- Glaze --
   1      cup           raspberry or strawberry jelly
     1/4  cup           water
   1      tablespoon    ketchup
   3      tablespoons   minced onion
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   cider vinegar

At least 3 hours and preferably the evening before you plan to smoke the ribs, mix the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Coat the ribs with the Worcestershire sauce.  Massage the ribs with all but 2 tsp. of the spice mixture, reserving the remaining rub.  Place the ribs in a plastic bag and refrigerate them for at least 2 hours. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature.  Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Combine the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan.  Warm the mixture over medium heat, simmering about 10 minutes. Reserve the glaze at room temperature. Transfer the ribs to the smoker.  Cook the meat until you can bend it easily between the ribs, about 2 3/4 to 3 hours at a temperature of 225 to 250. About 1 hour before the ribs are done, brush them thickly with the glaze; repeat the step in the last 15 minutes of cooking.  The glaze will be sticky and caramelized in spots. Let the slabs sit for 5-10 minutes before slicing them into individual ribs...serve.

Technique tip:  Slabs of baby back ribs come with a thin membrane that covers their underside.  It's not essential to remove the membrane, but spices sink more fully into the meat when it's gone, and ribs slice more easily.  Push a small knife tip under the membrane or scrape one of the rib bones until the tissue loosens.  Work your fingers under the membrane and then strip it off in one or more sections.

     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
     3/4  cup           Heinz catsup
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce

In a saucepan, mix vinegar, water, sugar, mustard, butter, lemon, onion, and seasonings.  Simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes.  Add Worcestershire sauce and catsup, bring back to a boil and its done.  (Good Housekeeping CB, 1955) NOTE: I do not use cayenne or salt and always double this recipe.  Into the double recipe, I add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown sugar.  This gives the sauce more of a sweet and sour taste.  It is just excellent on Baby Back Ribs, which I simmer in water with a little vinegar, garlic and just a pinch of salt for about 30 minutes before barbecuing.  Through trial and error, I have found that Heinz ketchup is thicker and makes a "clingier" sauce.

   2                    jalapenos -- chopped
     3/4  cup           white vinegar
     1/2  cup           all purpose flour
     1/2  cup           nuoc nam
     1/4  cup           sugar
     1/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   4      tablespoons   garlic powder
   4      tablespoons   black pepper
   3      tablespoons   paprika
   3      tablespoons   Tabasco sauce

Place chicken carcasses, bay leaves, peppercorns, and pork jowl in 6 quarts of water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook for 2 hours.  Remove from heat, strain, and let cool.

Place roasting hen in a Dutch oven.  Add water, cover, and bake for 2 hours at 325F.  Remove, let cool, and pull meat into thumb sized chunks, discarding skin and fat.  Reserve.

Smoke pork shoulder for 8-12 hours, or until internal temperature reaches 160F.  You may finish in a covered pan in the oven if time is a factor; however, it must smoke for at least 8 hours.  Pull about 2 pounds into thumb sized chunks and reserve.  Use the rest of the smoked pork shoulder for barbeque.

Return stock to the stove, bring to a gentle boil, and throw everything into the pot.  Cook at a gentle boil for 1 hour.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for an additional 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat and serve immediately.

1/4		   cup			flour
1			T			baking soda

2						eggs

I do cornbread like this: Put about 1/4 cup bacon grease in a cast iron skillet in the oven at 425 and let it heat up. While its heating take a large bowl and mangle together 1 3/4 cups of cornmeal, 1/4 cups flour, 1 T baking soda, 1 T salt, 1 T sugar, 2 eggs, and enough milk to make it wet, but not too wet..(about like pancake batter) and mix it up good. Make sure the bacon grease is sizzling in the oven, then pour the hot grease into the mixture and stir it a little more. Make sure the skillet is still real hot, then pour the mix into the skillet and cook it in the oven till its nice and brown on top. When its done, cut it like a pie and slather up with some real cow butter. You can also substitute a little honey for the sugar. Now some of these Crackers claim it don't need any sugar, but I like it better with a little sweetening in it.

Rub and let sit for a few hours, smoke with a mild wood for 1-2 hours. Don't let the tenderloin get over 165F or it'll start drying out like a field of hay in a Texas drought. Tenderloins are great to smoke in a short time and this rub is mighty tasty.

   1      cup           vegetable oil
   2      tablespoons   lemon pepper (Tones brand)

Recipe makes enough for 6 large chicken breasts.

Brine the chicken breasts (I used Dan Gill's brine recipe) for 2 hours in the refrigerator. Remove breasts from brine and rinse in cold running water. Pat breasts dry on paper towels. Marinate breasts in the Italian dressing in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Generously sprinkle on rub on both sides of breasts and under skin if possible. Let breasts sit in refrigerator for 1 hour. Smoke chicken breasts 240-250F with strong to medium flavor wood. Mop every 30 minutes on both sides. Remove from smoker when internal temperature in thickest part of breast reaches 155F, about 2 hours for the largest breasts.

Note: smoked chicken will be pink even when it is done. Go by internal temperature, not color.

   1      teaspoon      red savina or habanero powder
                        (or cayenne powder for any lightweights)

This is absolutely wonderful when used on a rib eye or shell steak, marinated at room temperature for about an hour, then seared and cooked to rare over hot coals.

It also makes a great basting sauce for smoked chickens. For that, I reserve the marinade, basting during smoking and then reduce it by 1/2 to serve as a sauce for the chickens. Halve or quarter the bird and serve with the sauce drizzled over the pieces of chicken and ears of grilled corn-on-the-cob.

                        butter

Melt the butter (NOT MARGARINE) all over the bottom of your baking pan.  Now mix the sour cream with the Bisquick and then pour in the 7-up and mix all that up well.  Turn the dough out onto a surface dusted heavily with Bisquick and be sure to put some Bisquick on your hands and whatever you're gonna use to cut the biscuits.  One you have it rolled out to the right thickness (remember that Bisquick doesn't rise all that much) cut 'em out and put them into the pan.

Bake at 425F until brown.  This takes about twenty minutes.  Midway through baking, by the way, pour some more melted butter over them.  You should do this when the biscuits a re risen, but not yet very brown.

I defy anyone to eat this with anything.  They are just perfect the way they are.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      pounds        pork loin
   1      pound         dried black beans
   4      cloves        garlic
   3      tablespoons   chili powder
   5                    hot chile peppers -- skinned and chopped
   1      tablespoon    ground cumin
   1      teaspoon      oregano
   1      medium        onion -- chopped
   2      whole         jalapenos -- skinned and chopped
  28      ounces        crushed tomatoes -- drained
  28      ounces        chopped tomatoes -- drained
                        GARNISH:
   1      cup           cheddar cheese -- shredded
     1/2  cup           fresh cilantro -- chopped
   1      cup           sour cream
   2                    avocados -- diced
     1/2  cup           onion -- chopped

Cover and soak beans overnight or longer. 
Start the smoker and when hot, put the pork loin on the smoker, using your favorite wood for flavor. (I used hickory.) 
Smoke for an hour or so at 225F and then hold until you're ready to start assembly. Pour everything in a stock pot except the tomatoes, jalapenos and, of course, the garnishes. Keep covered with water and cook 6 hours on low heat (cover the pot but leave cracked slightly open to allow a bit of steam to escape).  Add additional water as necessary. 
After 6 hours, remove meat and shred. Put the shredded pork back in the pot and add tomatoes and jalapenos (as many as you want) and cook another hour or until thickened. 
Serve in individual dishes along with garnishes. Garnish with chopped cilantro, sour cream, chopped onion, diced avocado and shredded cheese.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Sides

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For the beans
   1      pound         dried black beans
     1/2  teaspoon      dried thyme
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/4  teaspoon      fennel seed
   2      cloves        garlic -- peeled
   1                    bay leaf
                        For the dressing
     2/3  cup           red onion -- chopped
     1/2  cup           red bell pepper -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   parsley -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   cilantro -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   scallion -- chopped
   1      tablespoon    ground cumin
     1/8  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
   4      tablespoons   olive oil
  10      tablespoons   lime juice -- (about 5 limes)
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

This dish is Mexican/Southwestern in concept.  It's a bit like a salad of greens, where black beans substitute for the lettuce and the rather large dose of lime juice makes it surprisingly refreshing.  It travels well and is better the day after it's made: a good accompaniment to hot or cold grilled meat.  You can also add cold grilled meat directly to the salad and turn it into an entree.

Sort the beans carefully, discarding any small pebbles that may be mixed in.  Soak the beans in cold water to cover for 5 hours, then drain and rinse them well.

Put the beans in a saucepan and add enough water to come about 1 1/2 inches above them.

Add the thyme, salt, fennel seed, garlic, and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender but not mushy.

Drain the beans and rinse them under cold water for 1 minute to stop the cooking process.  Drain them again.

In a large bowl, combine the dressing ingredients and mix well.  Add the beans, toss, and serve.  This salad keeps for 4 to 5 days covered and refrigerated.

Note: Both of these are old family favorites - especially when made by Grandmothers. They can be made as low fat desserts and not really lose anything. We usually make the no-crust pie as we like it a little better but I prefer the name "crunch".

     1/2  cup           thousand island dressing
   2      tablespoons   horseradish -- grated

Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact; cut off any hanging roots. Using small, sharp knife, divide onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2 inch away. Cut each section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or "petals" will begin to open. Remove onion from hot water and immerse into ice water, to help the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on paper towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker crumbs or coating mix in paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat. Refrigerate for 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cooked onion may be kept for a time in warm oven. The "Outback Steakhouse" serves this with a delicious hot-hot sauce to dunk in. They also add hot spices to the flour and/or coating mix.

   1      teaspoon      distilled white vinegar
   2      tablespoons   ice water -- approximately
                        ***FILLING***
     2/3  cup           packed dark brown sugar
     1/4  cup           fresh lemon juice
   1      tablespoon    vanilla extract
   1 1/4  teaspoons     cinnamon
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/2  stick         unsalted butter
   4      pounds        tart green apples -- cut 1/4", peeled
                        ***STREUSEL***
     3/4  cup           all-purpose flour
   4 1/2  tablespoons   sugar
   2      tablespoons   unsalted butter
   3                    Heath (1.4 oz) toffee bars -- chopped
   1      large         egg beaten with:
   2      tablespoons   water -- (glaze)

For crust, combine flour and salt in medium bowl.  Cut in butter and shortening with fork till mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in sugar, egg and vinegar.  Mix in just enough ice water, 1 tbs. at a time, to form dough that holds together.  Divide dough in half, flatten each half into disc, wrap each in plastic and chill 4 hours. 
For filling, combine ingredients (except apples and butter), add apples and toss to coat.  Melt butter in large skillet over medium high heat.  Add apple mixture and cook till apples are slightly softened, about 10 minutes.  Cover and chill.  Preheat oven to 350F.  On a floured surface, roll out 1 dough piece to 14" diameter.  Transfer to a 9" deep dish glass pie dish.  Trim edges leaving 1/2" overhang.  Fold overhang under and let rest on rim of dish.  Line crust with foil.  Fill with dried beans and bake 10 minutes.  Remove beans and foil.  Bake crust till crust has set but has no color, about 5 minutes.  Remove and cool, leave oven on. 
For streusel, combine flour and sugar in bowl.  Using fork mix in butter till coarse meal forms.  Stir in toffee.  On lightly floured surface, roll out 2nd dough disc to 14" diameter.  Mound apple filling in prebaked pie crust.  Sprinkle streusel over filling.  Top with dough round.  Trim dough leaving 1/2" overhang.  Gently pinch crust edges together to seal.  Brush pie with glaze.  Cut 5 slits in pie top to allow steam to escape.  Bake until crust is golden and apples are tender, about 55 minutes.  Cool pie 1 hour.  Serve with good quality vanilla ice cream.

                          Bo's Cowboy Cassoulet

Recipe By     : Lou Jane Temple

Categories    : Bbq List                         Sides

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        trimmed beef stew meat
                        salt pepper
   2      sticks        cinnamon
                        garlic cloves
   2                    ancho chilies
   2      pounds        dried northern beans, cooked
   3      pounds        Italian sausage; hot or mild
   2                    or 3 onions, finely diced
   4                    carrots, peeled
   6                    celery stalks
   1      large         can tomatoes
   2                    ancho chilies
                        chicken stock


1. Oven roast 5 lbs. of trimmed beef stew meat. Season with salt and pepper, 2 cinnamon sticks, a handful of garlic cloves and 2 ancho chilies soaked in warm water (use the water too). Roast at 375F, 2-3 hours, until the meat is tender. Cool and refrigerate; then remove the fat that has congealed on the top.

2. Soak and cook 2 lbs. dried northern beans, adding salt after the beans are tender. Cool the beans by surrounding the pot with an ice-water bath in the sink or transferring the hot beans into shallow plastic containers. Beans are easily soured, so it is important to not put them in the refrigerator hot. It will take too long for the middle of the pot to cool.

3. Sausage: 3 lbs. hot or mild Italian sausage or a combination of the two. Prick the sausage with a fork on both sides. Roast 25 minutes at 375F. Cool the sausage and cut into three-inch chunks.

4. Finely dice 2-3 onions, 4 peeled carrots, and 6 celery stalks. Saut� until onions are clear. In a large ovenproof roasting pan, combine the defatted beef, the beans, sausage and the vegetables. Add 1 large can of tomatoes, 2 more ancho chilies that have been soaked in warm water, and enough chicken stock to make the whole mixture very wet.

Do not combine until right before you bake or the beans will absorb the moisture and the dish will be dry. Top the mixture with toasted bread crumbs and bake at 350F until the sides are bubbling, the crumbs have browned and formed a crust, and the middle of the casserole is hot.

Notes: "...cowboy stew... It was kind of an American version of cassoulet, with White beans sausage and beef and a complex heat Heaven guessed came from dried chilies.

   1                    Lot sausage casing

Cook meat, liver, salt and pepper in water to cover until meat falls apart. Remove meat and reserve some of broth.  While still warm,   grind meat, onion, green onions, and parsley, saving about 1/2 cup of green onions and parsley mixture.  Mix the ground meat mixture with the 1/2 cup of green onions and parsley, rice and enough broth to make a moist dressing.  Stuff the dressing into sausage casing using a sausage stuffer.  May be refrigerated, may be frozen.  Prepare for eating by steaming, as microwaving or frying will shrink and burst casing.

                        charcoal briquettes
   6                    wood chips, (up to 8) preferably fruitwood

Combine all marinade ingredients; blend well.  The marinade for this dish can be prepared a day in advance; marinating should go on for 24 hours.

Lay the pork tenderloins in a ceramic or glass dish and pour marinade over them.  Turn the tenderloins several times during the 24 hours that they are marinating in the refrigerator.  When ready to cook, pat the pork dry.

Preheat charcoal in an outdoor grill and soak the wood chips in water for 30 minutes.  Add the chips to the hot coals.  Roast the pork evenly for about 40 minutes, until its internal temperature is 165 F.  If pork is to be eaten hot, allow it to sit on the edge of the grill for 10 minutes or so after it is cooked so that the juices can be drawn back into the meat.

Good served either hot or cold, accompanied by a green tomato chutney.

   2      tablespoons   hot red chili powder
   2      tablespoons   mild red chili powder
   1                    onion finely chopped
   1      tablespoon    minced garlic
  14      ounces        tomato puree
     1/2  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   cider vinegar
     1/2  cup           yellow mustard
     1/2  cup           firmly packed brown sugar
     1/4  cup           bourbon
   2      drops         Liquid Smoke flavoring -- up to 3

Place the lard in a large, non reactive saucepan and saut� the onion and garlic until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients and continue cooking for about another 30 minutes.  Stir frequently to prevent sauce from burning.  Allow to rest for at least an hour before using.

This is a marinating or basting sauce.  To marinate, coat the meat with the sauce and leave in the refrigerator, covered, over night, or about 8 to 12 hours.  Continue to baste with the sauce as the meat cooks.  It's NOT a table sauce, but works best when cooked into the meat.  Best with pork or beef.

Makes about 2 cups.

NOTES : "Straight bourbon, believe it or not, has a remarkably tonic effect on a fish steak, most notably cuts of swordfish and tuna."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4  Cup           white bread with no crust
     3/4  cup           milk
  10      ounces        veal
  22      ounces        pork with some fat
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/4  teaspoon      white pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      mace
     1/2  teaspoon      minced fresh marjoram
                        or 1/4 tsp. dried (crumbled)
                        prepared hog casings

Soak the bread in the milk for 10 minutes. Then drain, reserving the milk. Grind the bread, veal, and pork in a food processor, in batches if necessary, until emulsified. They can also be coarsely ground in a meat grinder for a more unusual, but still authentic bratwurst. 
Stir the salt, pepper, mace, and marjoram into the milk, then stir or process the milk into the meats. 
Stuff firmly into prepared hog casings and tie off in 4" lengths. It is easier to stuff the casings if you let the mixture stiffen, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours, but not essential. Prick any air pockets with a pin. 
Poach the sausages for 20 minutes. You can eat them right away, or you can fry them in butter over low heat until browned all over. You can also barbecue or grill them raw. Never fry the sausages until you're ready to eat them. Raw sausages can be refrigerated for 2 to 3 days, poached will keep for 1 week. They can also be frozen, raw or poached, for up to 3 months.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3                    feet small (1-1/2-inch diameter) hog casings
   1 1/2  pounds        lean pork butt -- cubed
   1      pound         veal -- cubed
     1/2  pound         pork fat -- cubed
     1/4  teaspoon      ground allspice
     1/2  teaspoon      crushed caraway seeds
     1/2  teaspoon      dried marjoram
   1      teaspoon      freshly ground white pepper
   1      teaspoon      salt -- or to taste

Bratwurst resembles plump hot dogs. This recipe makes three pounds.

1. Prepare the casings. 
2. Grind the pork, veal, and pork fat separately through the fine blade of the grinder. 
3. Mix the ground meats and grind again. 
4. Add the remaining ingredients to the meat mixture and mix thoroughly. 
5. Stuff the mixture into the casings and twist off into four- or five-inch lengths. 
6. Refrigerate for up to two days. The bratwurst can be pan fired, barbecued,  or grilled over charcoal.

                        pickling spice -- optional

Corned beef brisket is simply a beef brisket, the same cut that is barbecued,  that has been brined. A simple brine is: 25 pounds of salt, 12 ounces of rock salt peter, 2 pounds of sugar, and 15 gallons of water. Boil all ingredients except the brisket, skim, and let cool. Once cooled the briskets are placed in the brine and held under with a weight. Cover. 
The brisket will be ready for use in seven to ten days. I also like to add pickling spices to the brine.

                         -- peppers to taste

Mix this together in a glass or enamel bowl; add the fish and submerge the fillets with a weight to hold them under the brine. Brine the fillets in the refrigerator from 2 to 4 hours (longer makes the fish saltier).

Remove the fillets and wipe dry with paper towels. Place them, skin side down, on several thicknesses of dry paper towels and let them air dry for several hours. The surface is dry enough when your finger sticks to the flesh.

Hot smoke over a 250F wood fire for about 2 hours or until the fillets are firm to the touch (like medium rare steak).

Peel off the skin and serve.

Fill a large container with 1/2 quart of warm water. Add ingredients. Mix thoroughly until well dissolved. Add the remaining 1 1/2 quarts of water.

Immerse prepared fish chunks, filets or small whole fish completely in brine solution. Refrigerate fish in brine solution. Brine chunks of fish of fish 1" thick for about 5 up to 8 hours, 1/2" thick for about 4 hours, and for thinner filets or pieces 2-3 hours.

After brining, always rinse your fish with plenty of fresh water. Pat the fish dry, and allow them to air dry for about 1 hour. This will cause a "pellicle" (a tacky glaze on the fish) to form indicating that it is ready for the drying and smoking process.

Well did my 100 lb. brined pig and turned out amazing.  Brined for 5 days.  Was a pretty lean pig to start with but trimmed where I had to too 1/4" fat.  Took pig out Friday am and thinking I might of overbrined I made like a pepper rub.  Cayenne, black pepper, paprika, chile powder(Top Hat) and a little onion and garlic powder.  Rubbed all over and covered until I put on spit at 2 am Sat.  I did not turn my spit continuously.  I turned every two or three hours to position on back or sides.  I didn't look in pit for the first 4 hours and when I did it was taking on a very nice golden color but looked dry, probably from the salt.  So made a mop of vinegar, olive oil, and what rub I had left over. Worked great. Cooked with hickory until 3 p.m. (13 hrs), internal was 170 when taken out of cooker.  Cooking temp was 200 to 225F the entire time and temperature outside was 20F.  I must say this pig was buy far the most golden in color and the most tasty, moist pig I've done to date.  Fed around 100 people, and when I went around to ask how the pig was, no one would answer, they devoured it.  You pork butt smokers should try this.  I made up 25 gallons of brine, and I used solar salt for first time, cheap.

   1      dozen         flour tortillas

   1      handful       longhorn cheddar cheese -- grated
   1      dash          hot sauce

We make one at the joint that goes like this: lightly butter grill and warm a 10 inch flour tortilla on both sides--not for too long, or it will become dry and tough. Remove tortilla. Place several thin slices of smoked brisket or pork up and down the middle of the tortilla, until you are about one inch from the ends. Add saut�ed green chilies and onions, a hand full of grated Long Horn cheese, a little hot sauce, and roll it. You end up with one great burrito that is hard to beat.

   2 1/2  tablespoons   dark brown sugar
   1 1/2  teaspoons     dried sweet basil
     1/8  teaspoon      ground cumin
     3/4  teaspoon      ground coriander

     1/4  cup           brown sugar
     1/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   2      cups          water

   1      teaspoon      celery seed
                        salt to taste

Prepare the rub: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Store the mixture in an airtight container for up to four months. There's no need to refrigerate it.

To use the rub: Massage it into the meat thoroughly the night before you plan to grill or bake. Wrap the meat well in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until cooking time, so the flavors will be absorbed into the meat.

Mix all ingredients for sauce and boil 15 minutes. Pour sauce over finished meat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   6      pounds        stewing hen
                        (or two 3 lb. broilers)
   2      large         onions -- sliced
   2      cups          diced okra -- optional
   4      cups          fresh or
   2                    (l lb. cans tomatoes)
   2      cups          lima beans -- frozen
   3      medium        potatoes -- diced
   4      cups          corn cut from cob or
   2                    (cans of corn -- 1 lb. each)
   3      teaspoons     salt
   1      teaspoon      pepper
   1      tablespoon    sugar

Cut chicken in pieces and simmer in 3 quarts of water for a THIN stew, or 2 quarts of water for a THICK stew, until meat can easily be removed from the bones, about 2 1/4 hours. Remove chicken and let cool.

Add the vegetables to the broth and simmer uncovered until the beans and potatoes are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent scorching. Add the chicken deboned and diced, or in sections. Add the seasonings.

NOTE: If canned vegetables are used, include their juices and reduce water to 2 quarts for a thin stew, and 1 quart for a thick stew.

ALSO NOTE: Brunswick Stew is one of those delectable things that benefit from long, slow cooking. It is a rule in some homes never to eat Brunswick Stew the same day it is made, because its flavor improves if it is left to stand overnight and is reheated the next day.

In a shallow bowl, mix the flour, salt, pepper, thyme and cayenne. Dredge the damp chicken pieces in the seasoned flour. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately high heat. Dredge the chicken again if the coating looks damp, and shake any excess back into the bowl. Reserve the excess seasoned flour. Add the chicken pieces to the pan in a single layer without crowding, in batches if necessary, and cook, turning, until golden brown, about 7 minutes per batch. Lower the heat if necessary about 1/2 way through, so the fat doesn't burn. 
Remove the chicken to a large flame proof casserole. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and the onions to the skillet. Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the ham and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes longer. Sprinkle the reserved seasoned flour over the ham and onions and cook., stirring, 30-45 seconds. Pour in half the stock. Bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Boil stirring, until slightly thickened. Pour everything in the skillet over the chicken in the casserole. Add the tomatoes, the remaining stock, the green pepper, and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to moderately low, and simmer, partially covered, 15 minutes. Add the lima beans and corn and simmer uncovered until the chicken and vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes longer. Skim any fat off the top of the sauce. Remove and discard the bay leaf and season with additional salt and pepper to taste before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      5 lb.         Boston butt pork -- up to 8
                        -- roast -- smoked
  16      ounces        apple cider vinegar
   4      tablespoons   cayenne pepper flakes
   8      bulbs         garlic
                        PAN SAUCE-----
  12      ounces        apple cider vinegar
   2      tablespoons   cayenne pepper flakes
   1      tablespoon    salt
   2      cups          water

While nothing can duplicate the sweet ambrosia of slow, pit-cooked, whole hog Eastern North Carolina barbeque, this is a right close backyard approximation for those of us who find themselves exiled in distant, heathen regions of barbeque heresy.

First, get yourself some pork shoulders or Boston Butt roasts, as many as your smoker will hold comfortably.  I use a Brinkmann Professional Pit Smoker with an offset firebox, but you can do this with a vertical Brinkmann water smoker as well. The key is providing a moist, smoky, indirect heat for a long period of time.

What I do is put a bag of charcoal in the firebox, open the vents, light it, and let it burn down to coals. Then I add wood (generally oak, since hickory is scarce up here)--two parts wet (soaked) wood to one part dry--regulate the dampers, and put the shoulders or butts, fat side up, in the cooking chamber. Beneath the meat I put a drip pan half-filled with apple cider vinegar. You must keep the heat between 180-260F throughout the smoking process; the optimum range is 220-240F. Normally, I'll add apple wood to the firebox as well, and I always add between 5-7 whole heads of garlic during the process. Keep the firebox fed and a good smoke going for between 8 to 10 hours. Do not open the cooking chamber to baste the meat--the only time you open the cooking chamber is when the temperature spikes above 260F, and you open it only long enough to bring the temperature back in the proper range. By the time the smoking period is finished, the outside of the pork will have a golden amber to dark brown crust.

Now, take the meat and put it in a covered Dutch oven. If it's too dark outside to continue, preheat your indoor stoves' oven to just under 300F; otherwise, just raise the temperature in the cooking chamber a like amount. Get a quart-sized Mason jar; fill it halfway with apple cider vinegar, add one (or more) teaspoons of red pepper flakes, and fill the rest of the jar with water. Dump this into the Dutch oven with the pork, cover, and cook until the meat falls from the bone, about 2 more hours or so.

When the meat is done, let it cool a bit. [NOTE: If you're too tired, you can stop here for the day--cover 'em up, put them in the fridge, and warm 'em up the next morning and continue

The procedure. While it's cooling, fill some 16 ounce bottles with apple cider vinegar, adding about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to each one (I use Grolsch beer bottles with those pull-down caps, any excuse for buying good beer...). When the pork has cooled enough to handle (I use latex gloves) pull it into thumb-sized chunks, discarding as much fat as possible. Pack roughly 3 pounds of barbeque into a large frying pan (I use a Number 10 size cast iron skillet). Dissolve 1 tablespoon of salt into 2 1/2 cups of warm water and pour it into the pan. Add about 12 ounces of your apple cider vinegar and red pepper sauce, turn the heat to medium, and let the liquid slowly simmer off, stirring frequently, until the sauce just barely oozes over the top of your spatula when you press down on the barbeque with it. Remove from heat, and congratulate yourself--you've just made a fine batch of Eastern North Carolina Style Barbeque.

   1 1/2  teaspoons     coarse black pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      cayenne
                        PART TWO:
   6                    onions -- finely chopped
   2                    green peppers -- finely chopped
   1      medium        turnip -- finely diced
  10                    tomatoes -- peeled and chopped
   2      cups          fresh butter beans -- shelled
   2      cups          celery -- thinly sliced
   2      cups          cabbage -- finely chopped
   2      cups          fresh okra -- sliced
   2      cups          fresh corn (six ears, husked)
     1/2                unpeeled lemon -- seeded

If you make this in 2 parts, on successive days, it is not such a chore. Put all ingredients from part one in a roaster, bring to a boil and simmer slowly, covered, for about 4 hours. Let cool and strain. Cut chicken and meat fine, removing all skin, bone and gristle. Kitchen scissors are good for this job. Return to stock and refrigerate.

The following day lift off half of the fat, add all the vegetables except corn and okra and cook another hour or until thick.

Cut corn twice, scraping cobs to get the milk. Add this along with the lemon and additional seasonings. If you finish the cooking in the oven, it will eliminate stirring and watching. Cook, uncovered, at 300F for about 2 hours until the consistency of a thick stew. This will make a gallon. If made before hand, reheat in the oven to insure against scorching. 
Serve in mugs and sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley.

NOTES : This is best made when fresh vegetables are at their peak, but frozen
vegetables and canned tomatoes can be used when necessary. It freezes well.

   2                    onions -- rough chopped
   5      cloves        garlic -- rough chopped

                         -- peeled and chopped
   2      sticks        lemon grass -- roughly chopped
   2                    red chilies seeded and chopped
                        -- habaneros  or Thai chilies
   1      tablespoon    fish sauce -- (nam pla)
   1      teaspoon      ground turmeric
   4      tablespoons   Veg. oil
   3      pounds        chicken, cut into 8 curry pieces
   4                    green (or two black) cardamom pods
   2      tablespoons   rough chopped coriander/cilantro leaf
                        Salt and fresh ground black pepper

*Curry pieces: cut off both legs and thighs together taking as much meat as possible from the carcass at the top of the thigh, separate legs and thighs.  Cut down along breast as far as wing at side of breast bone to expose ribs, cut through ribs at top along length of breast bone, cut through ribs at bottom of breast as far as wing, cut wing at joint with body and remove breast and wing as one piece, cut into two approximately one third along breast from wing.

Grind the first 7 ingredients (i.e. up to and including the turmeric) together into a smooth paste (food processor/pestle and mortar etc). 
 Heat oil in wide frying pan or wok and add paste, stir-fry until moisture has evaporated and paste has started to brown.  Add chicken pieces and stir well, scrape bottom of pan to prevent sticking.  Cover tightly and simmer for 35-45 minutes - there should be enough liquid given off from the chicken during cooking but check now and then and stir.  If chicken does get too dry and starts sticking/burning (and it's never happened to me) add a tablespoon or so of water and stir in, scraping residue off bottom of pan.

Shortly before chicken is ready slit open cardamom pods and extract seeds, crush seeds in pestle and mortar and add to chicken with coriander leaf, stir and simmer for a further minute or so, taste and adjust seasoning.

Serve with plain rice or coconut rice.  Drink beer: Singha, Bintang or Tiger beers are excellent, Pilsner Urquell is good too.

Ken Hom has a similar recipe but he omits the Nam Pla and adds 1 tbs. dry sherry and two tbs. soy sauce just before the simmering which makes it much more like a Straits Chinese or Nonna dish.

Add ketchup and keep beating Add salt and garlic salt, beating all the time.  Add wine vinegar (this will thin the sauce down).  Beat this thoroughly, adding the lemon juice as you do so.

Cut the potatoes into 1" cubes.  Add to boiling salted water.  Cook just until fork tender but not mushy, about 7 minutes.  Drain and cool.  Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the salt, peppers, onion and garlic power, cumin and cayenne pepper.  Add the potatoes to the spices.  Toss to coat all pieces evenly.  You may do this much in advance and hold the potatoes as long as an hour before completing the dish.  Heat about 1" oil in a wok or deep skillet to about 350F or until a piece of potato sizzles when added to the oil.  Add the potatoes.  Fry until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently.  Remove from fat, drain and serve immediately.

   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
                        - -- Frying ---
   5      gallons       vegetable or peanut oil

If at all possible, select a fresh (never frozen) turkey and one that has not been injected with butter, seasonings, or other flavorings.  You need a food injector with a fairly large hole to inject the turkey.  Do this a day ahead, then cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.

It is best to fry the turkey outdoors, using a propane burner or other outdoor cooking equipment on a concrete slab or some type of solid, level, and non slippery surface.  A few drops of oil will probably bubble over, so have some old towels handy for wiping up slippery spots.

Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

To prepare the turkey:  If your turkey comes with a metal prong that holds the cavity closed, remove and set aside.  Remove the giblets and neck from the turkey - checking both ends.  Remove any "pop-up" doneness indicator.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over high heat until half melted.  Add the onions and saut� about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the celery, garlic, hot peppers, salt, red pepper, and the black pepper.  Cook until the mixture is a rich golden brown, about 3 minutes, stirring and scraping the pan bottom frequently.  Add the stock and Worcestershire and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.   Remove from heat and cool slightly.  Blend on highest speed until mixture is a very smooth puree, pushing sides down as needed.

Rinse and drain turkey well.  Pour puree into the injector and inject into the turkey.  Insert to the bone or to the depth of the injector needle, without piercing through the cavity.  To fill the injection hole with as much puree as possible, begin to draw the needle out while injecting firmly.  Make holes about 2 inches apart and use most of the puree in the meatiest areas.  Be sure to inject some of the puree in the upper joint of the wing.  Pour any remaining puree into the cavity of the turkey and rub it over the inner surface.  Set turkey aside.

Sprinkle the reserved seasoning mix evenly over the bird and inside the cavity, rubbing it in by hand and using it all.  Place the neck back inside the cavity.  Close the legs with the metal prong or tie with kitchen twine.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Equipment:  Assemble all equipment and utensils before starting to fry the turkey.  You will need: 1.  A propane burner or other heat source with an adjustable control capable of a strong flame.  2.  A very deep pot (8 gallon or larger) so the turkey will be totally submerged in hot oil with plenty left over - a depth of several extra inches for the oil to bubble in without bubbling over.  3.  A large boiling or fry basket large enough to hold the turkey and fitting into the pot.  The turkey will be slipped into and lifted out of the bubbling hot oil in the basket.   4.  A thermometer that reads up to at least 400F and has a long probe and clip so it can be left in the oil while the turkey fries.  5.  Two strong utensils for turning the turkey (20 inches or longer).  It may be necessary to weight the turkey down by inserting a long-handled heatproof fork securely under the metal prong or by pressing down with some utensil.  Do not use anything that would keep a section of skin from being exposed to the hot oil  for frying.  6.  A large platter or pan lined with several thicknesses of paper bags to drain the turkey once it's fried.  7.  Plenty of hot pads.  8.  Old towels to deal with any spilt oil.

Let the turkey come to room temperature for 1 hour before frying.  Place the turkey on its back inside the fry basket.  Place the basket in the EMPTY pot and measure the turkey's height in the pot with a ruler.  Remove basket and turkey.  Place pot on the burner and fill with oil at least to cover the height of the turkey.  Remember, the oil will be higher in the pot with the turkey submerged.

It is recommended that a dress rehearsal be held to make sure that you can slip the turkey into the pot gently.  Any splashing with super hot oil can be very dangerous.

To fry: Heat oil to 400F.  VERY CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY lower the basket containing the turkey into the oil.  Immediately adjust the flame down slightly and maintain a temperature lowered to as close to 350F as possible.  Oil should be hot enough to bubble during frying but not so hot that it burns the meat.

Make sure the turkey is submerged while frying.  Let the turkey fry until the juices run clear when you insert a skewer into the breast meat.  Total frying time will be between 35 and 45 minutes.  The fried turkey will look very dark brown when done.

Carefully remove the basket and turkey from the hot oil and place turkey breast side down on a platter or pan lined with several thicknesses of brown paper bags and let drain for about 5 minutes.  Then turn turkey over to drain and cool about 15 minutes before slicing.

Again, be very careful with the hot oil.  It is deadly.

Regional - Creole, Lamb The taste of this delicious offering of lamb shanks will result in numerous requests to share your recipe.  Unless told, they will be puzzled as to what type meat is being served.  Roll lamb shanks in flour, salt and pepper then, in a large Dutch oven, saut� in hot Olive oil until browned.  (about 15 minutes).  Remove and set aside.

Add to same pan, 2 chopped onions, 1 chopped large green bell pepper, 1/2 stalk chopped celery, 4 or more chopped cloves of garlic.  Saut� over medium heat until vegetables are softened.

Return the lamb shanks to the pan and add 2 cans chopped Cajun style tomatoes, 1/2 can beef stock, 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar, 1 teaspoon thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 cup of wine and, if desired, 3 tablespoons Tabasco sauce.

   2      tablespoons   Hungarian paprika
   1      tablespoon    cayenne pepper
   1      tablespoon    black pepper
   1      tablespoon    white pepper
   1      tablespoon    granulated garlic
   1      tablespoon    ground passilla chile
   2      teaspoons     dry mustard
   1      teaspoon      roasted and ground cumin
     1/2  teaspoon      thyme
     1/2  teaspoon      oregano
   1 1/2  tablespoons   kosher salt
   3      tablespoons   cayenne pepper sauce
   1      tablespoon    Worcestershire sauce
     1/4  cup           cider vinegar
  12      ounces        chicken stock
  12      ounces        beer

Place the dry ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and grind until very fine.  Place the liquid ingredients in a small saucepan and add the ground dry ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  When it comes to a boil, remove from heat and let cool completely .  Using a syringe with a large needle, inject the turkey every inch or so.  Do this 24 hours before cooking.  After 24 hours you can cook the turkey how you like, deep fried, smoked, roasted, etc.  I think the deep fry method is best suited for this marinade.

   1      pound         beef
                        ***MARINADE***
   2                    red jalapenos -- stems remove
     1/4  cup           lemongrass -- sliced thin
   6                    lime leaves or the peel of 1

Recipe by: Richard Sterling Cut beef into thin slices and thread onto skewers.

Mash or blend the Jalapeno, lemon grass, lime leaves, garlic and galangal together.  Combine the mixture with the remaining marinade ingredients.  and let cool.  Taste for sweetness; it should be present but not dominant.

Marinate the beef in the refrigerator for at least one hour.

Grill the skewers over hot coals, keeping the beef at least four inches from the heat lest the sugar burn, until desired doneness.

Serving suggestion: Before cooking, stick a chunk of fresh pineapple on the end of each skewer.  Serve with Green Mango Salad and steamed rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           dark or light brown sugar
   3      tablespoons   salt
   3      tablespoons   black pepper
   3      tablespoons   chili powder
   2      tablespoons   cumin powder
   2      tablespoons   paprika
   2      teaspoons     garlic powder -- optional
   2      teaspoons     lemon pepper -- optional

I adapted this rub from a recipe by my good friend Chris Schlesinger.  His version is in his book The Thrill of the Grill, which he wrote with John Willoughby.  I have altered the quantities of the ingredients to suit my own tastes.  This is an excellent all-purpose rub for chicken, fish, pork, beef, or lamb, and can also be a breading for deep-frying.  Sprinkle in into the batter for deep-fried zucchini, onion rings, or mushrooms.  Wow! for a basting sauce or marinade, I add soy sauce, vinegar, and water.

In the top half of a double boiler set over simmering water, combine all the ingredients.  Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so, until the sugar begins to melt and the mixture thickens.  Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool to 100F.

Pass the mixture through a sifter.  Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place for several months.

                        fresh jalapenos
   8      ounces        cream cheese
   8      ounces        cheddar cheese -- finely shredded
   8      ounces        Monterey jack cheese -- finely shredded
                        ***Batter***
                        beer
     1/2  cup           fried vegetable batter -- (Chuck Wagon)
     1/2  cup           flour
   1      teaspoon      garlic salt
   1      teaspoon      black pepper
   1      teaspoon      onion salt
   1      teaspoon      cayenne
                        ***Breading***
                        white cornmeal

There are essentially 5 functional parts of the perfect popper. 1) The pepper 2) The filling 3) The initial batter 4) The breading 5) The final batter

This recipe is for 150-200 poppers (to be made in advance)

The pepper: Fresh jalapenos.  Take your big batch of fresh picked (not pickled, canned, etc) jalapenos and wash them.  The ideal popper is 100% edible, so that you can pop the whole thing in your mouth, hence the name.  A potato peeler with a pointed end is the perfect tool for deseeding.  The radius of the peeler allows you to make a hole about 1 cm in diameter, which is optimized for efficient seed removal, effective stuffing of popper, and minimal leakage (more on that later).  Stab the pepper adjacent to the stem, with the stem on the concave side of your peeler, remove, turn pepper roughly 1 radian and repeat.  After 3 or 4 stabs, you will have separated the stem from the rest of the pepper. Pull out, with slight twisting motion, and you will remove most of the seeds. A little additional scraping may be required to get out the innards.  Your popper is now a capone.  Put aside and repeat until done.  If you do 200 peppers, it will take about an hour, depending on how many times you scratch your eye.  Add a half hour for each incidental mucous membrane contact.  My fingers were starting to 'prune' from the jalapeno juice when I finished.  People who haven't burned their fingers on oven doors and hot pans enough times to kill their nerves should probably wear gloves.

The filling: Cheese was a challenge.  Cream cheese was a little bland.  Cheddar was just too oily when it broke down.  Mozz and other white cheeses were just missing something.  Velveeta is only allowed in seven chile-head dishes, and this isn't one of them.  Cream cheese had the best consistency when cooked, but cheddar/Monterey jack blend has the best flavor.  Mix equal weights of cream cheese, finely shredded cheddar (sharp or very sharp), and finely shredded Monterey jack.  My batch used 8 ounces of each, which conveniently was also one package of each.  Mix these together in a bowl, until additional mixing makes no change in consistency.  You should have one big icky glob that has a wonderful aroma.  If, after stuffing 200 poppers you have lost your appetite because of the cheese smell, don't worry, you won't be eating them that day.

The batters: Both of them have basically the same ingredients.  The differences are in consistency (and time of preparation).  Don't use milk for the batter.  It won't grab the pepper, because of the waxy consistency.  Beer works best of beer, water and milk.  Use generic fried vegetable batter (I used the Chuck Wagon stuff), and an equal part of flour.  Season with garlic salt, black pepper, onion salt, and powdered cayenne for color (both in the batter and in the unsuspecting faces of your guests).  I used about 1 teaspoon of each to about 1/2 cup each of chuck wagon stuff and flour.

For the initial batter, you want it very thick, thicker than pancake batter. This is to hold the breading to the popper.  If you add too much beer at the start, add flour to thicken.  I think it took about half a beer for this.

For the final batter, you want it very thin, it should take less than a second for the batter to 'climb' the tines of a fork when removed and held vertically over the batter.  This has an added bonus of making those little crunchy things to eat with the poppers.  This was still less than a whole beer, so don't get too carried away- make it thick and add the beer in small amounts. Remember, don't make this until you're serving them!

The breading: Just a plate with a pile of white cornmeal, dry.

The process: After coring a sinkfull of peppers, stuff them all full of the cheese.  Use your pinky to pack the cheese in good, leaving about a 1/4 inch divot on the end of the pepper (recessed cheese, in case I'm not being clear).  Then line up your thick batter and corn meal, and an oven tray lined with aluminum foil. Dip the pepper in the batter, holding by the cheese and tip ends.  Allow as much of the excess batter as you can stand to drip off.  Then place the pepper in the corn meal.  Pick up a handful of meal and bury the pepper.  Place your hand on top of the pile (cupped), and apply some light pressure to help everything pack together.  Pick up the pepper and shake off the excess meal. Again, handle the pepper by the tips, it helps minimize the bald spots. Place the pepper on the tray, and repeat.  Place the pan in the freezer.  This is called flash freezing.  After about half an hour (the time it takes to fill the next tray) remove the first tray, and place all of the poppers in a big Ziploc bag.  Put the bag back in the freezer.  Wait overnight or longer.

The serving of and eating of poppers: Heat up grease in your fridaddy (or cauldron).  Make the final (thin) batter. Get some of your frozen poppers.  Some of the breading may have come off in spots, don't sweat it.  Dip the popper in the thin batter and put in the grease.  Don't worry about excess batter dripping in the grease, it makes good eats.  Cook until golden brown.  Conveniently, this is also the point where the cheese is melted, yet the pepper isn't overcooked.

Pop in yer mouth

I made 14 in two batches, with the following results 0 poppers leaking cheese 0 poppers having burnt spots 0 poppers losing breading 14 poppers tasting like fresh peppers 14 poppers being crisp enough to bite, but not so crisp that they don't flex 14 poppers where the cheese was perfectly melted 14 poppers that were golden brown

Capone Poppers There are essentially 5 functional parts of the perfect popper.  1) The pepper 2) The filling 5 (no, 3 sir) 3) The initial batter 4) The breading 5) The final batter

This recipe is for 150-200 poppers (to be made in advance, silly)

The pepper Fresh jalapenos.  I've made hab-poppers.  I could only eat 2.  Those deep fried death bombs are only for the most seasoned of leathermouths!

   1      bowl          salt

I place a bowl of salt inside the smoker when it is cooking and let the salt absorb the smoke.  It will get brown and crusty on the surface.  When I am through cooking, I mix this in with the rest of the salt.  It naturally dries out and is ready to be smoked again.  After a while it gets brown throughout and when the color gets dark
enough, it is then called 'mesquite smoked salt' or whatever kind of fuel you are using.

                        salt to taste

Cut a pork shoulder into 2" chunks. I use a cast iron pan. Brown the meat in a little oil. Add some chopped onion and garlic and brown the onion a little. Add some Mexican oregano, ground cumin and a couple of bay leaves. Add enough water to just cover the meat. Add some salt to taste. Simmer and keep adding water until the meat is fork tender. It should be very tender but not falling apart. Keep cooking until all the liquid is gone. After the liquid is gone, keep frying until the meat is browned again. The onion, garlic, and spices are dissolved during the long cooking time and when the liquid is cooked out, all the flavor is absorbed into the meat. This is delicious and the flavoring is difficult to describe. You just have to taste it. Serve with warm flour tortillas, some refried beans, and a little green chile sauce. I also like to fry up a batch of sliced onions to go with it.

It would be interesting to smoke the meat for a couple of hours before making the carnitas.

  10                    habaneros, pureed in 1/4 cup mustard

   1      teaspoon      black pepper
   6                    chicken thighs with legs -- chopped

Combine all ingredients except chicken in food processor or blender, and blend into a paste, making sure that the ingredients are all  fully integrated.  The paste should be the consistency of a thick tomato sauce. If its too thick, thin it with a little more white vinegar.

Cover the paste and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but not more that 2 weeks, for the flavors to blend together. Overnight is ideal.

Rub the chicken with the paste and place over a very low heat.  Or if you have a covered cooker, put the coals to one side, the chicken to the other and cover.

Cook about 1 hr without cover  or 1/2 hr if covered.  The key here is to use a very low heat.  Be patient.  Hard to overcook, the only way to screw it up is if you burn the paste by having the heat to high.  The longer the chicken stays on the grill, the more superior the smoky flavor.

Ever hear of it? I guess it's gone now but it was in Bellaire, Tx.  A friend of mine sent me their old rub recipe but it seems like it has an awful lot of salt in it for a pork rub.

For the rest of these ingredients does that sound too salty?

   2                    salmon fillets
   2                    thin untreated cedar planks
                        lots and lots of ginger -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   lime or lemon zest -- chopped fine
   2      tablespoons   orange zest -- chopped fine
                        salt and pepper
                        Cajun or Creole spice mix
                        olive oil

I tried this recipe last weekend, and it was amazing.  This is a variant of a signature dish of Emeril Lagasse (of the TVFN fame).

The original recipe used horseradish and trout instead of ginger and salmon.

I had a hard time finding thin cedar planks (shingles) sold singly in the local hardware store, they seemed to only sell them in bunches of 40.  I did however find untreated cedar shims that I was able to make do with.

So anyway, here's what you do:  Preheat your grill and oil up one side of the cedar with your olive oil.  Sprinkle a bit of the Cajun seasoning on the plank, and lay the filet of salmon on top.  Season the filet with salt, pepper, and the spice mix.  Cover the filet completely with the ginger and zest -- this adds flavor and helps the fish retain all of its moisture.  Put the whole thing directly on the grill over the coals, close the lid, and stand back!  The thing will smoke like crazy for a while. Check on the salmon after 15 minutes.  If the plank catches on fire before the salmon is done, simply spray it with some water (I had to do this a couple times).

When the salmon is done, you can either serve the whole thing with the cedar flaming around the edges, or remove it from the cedar plank and serve.

You may wish to remove most of the crushed ginger topping as it is a bit overpowering.

A nice sauce to accompany this can be made with soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil.  I don't know the measurements, I just winged it.

Saut� onions and garlic in peanut oil until soft.

Mix well and cook a few minutes then add:
tomato juice
cider vinegar
Worcestershire (or something)
liquid smoke (I keep meaning to try chipotle instead)
molasses (I actually use equal, after heat is off, because I do better without carbs--molasses tastes and looks better)

Simmer until it starts to reduce and smell right. The key, to me, is balancing hot, sour and sweet.

Shape in thumb-sized sausages, or in croquette size shapes.

Grill on open grill until done.

Serve with pita bread or hard rolls, and onions (raw or saut�ed).  The smaller size works great for an appetizer (on a toothpick).

Traditionally, these are not served in barbeque sauce.

   4      ounces        or 1 can green chili peppers -- chopped

Put everything but the meat in a big heavy kettle and simmer for 5 hours or until the beans are done.  Chop or pull the meat into bite-sized pieces and add to the kettle.  Continue to simmer another hour or until the desired thickness is achieved.  This is very simple to make, and delicious as a main course over white rice.

Note: If you just want beans, obviously just leave out the meat and serve it on the side.

Note #2: Yes, you can put the beans in a pot on the smoker.  I would use a wide shallow pan of sorts so more beans are exposed to the smoke.  You won't have to open the pit often to stir.  Leave then in there for an hour or so.

Recipe By     : Charlie
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Rubs And Spices

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           maple sugar
     1/4  cup           kosher salt
     1/4  cup           dried chilies -- ground
     1/2  cup           brown sugar

Mix rub ingredients together and store in air-tight jar.

                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOTES : I smoked two racks of spare-ribs yesterday using the maple sugar in the rub.

Usually I use (this is approximate, I don't really measure) 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup Kosher salt, and 1/4 cup  of whatever dried chilies I grind up. The maple sugar was VERY sweet when I tasted some, so I just used the maple sugar, salt, and ground chilies (no brown or white sugar).

I then smoked the ribs for about five hours at around 200F, using lump, hickory, and apple wood, spritzing with apple juice whenever I thought of it. They were very tender and the meat pulled cleanly from the bones. The maple sugar added a nice flavor, but lost most of the sweetness.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    chicken, 3 1/2 to 4 pounds
                        FOR THE MARINADE:
     1/4  cup           freshly squeezed lemon juice
     1/4  cup           extra virgin olive oil
   1      tablespoon    cracked black peppercorns
                        coarse sea salt to taste

Wash and dry the chicken.  Place chicken breast side down on a cutting board.  Using poultry shears or a cleaver, cut out the backbone (you'll need to make cuts on both sides of the bone, running the length of the bird to remove it.) Open the chicken like a book.  Using a sharp paring knife, score the top of the breast bone.  Run your thumbs along and under the sides of the breast bone and pop it out.  Lay chicken out flat.  Cut a 1-inch slit in the center of the lower half of each side.  Turn bird over and stick the end of each drumstick through the slit.  Breathe a sigh of relief-the hard work is over-the chicken is now officially spatchcocked.

Remove any lumps of fat.

Combine lemon juice, olive oil, and pepper in a non-reactive baking dish. Stir to mix.  Add spatchcocked chicken and marinate for at least 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours, turning a couple of times.

Build the fire.  Oil the grill.  Rake a 1-inch layer of glowing coals beneath it.  Spread the chicken out on top.  Grill the chicken until cooked, starting skin side down, 6 to 8 minutes per side, adding coals as needed.  Move the chicken from one side of the grill to the other to prevent scorching from flareups.  Baste the chicken with any excess marinade as it cooks.

                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOTES : Like all the Tuscan grilled fare, this one is supremely simple, consisting of chicken marinated in fresh lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and a generous dose of cracked black peppercorns.  The only tricky part is spatchcocking the chicken, that is removing the backbone and opening it up

  70      each          beef tri-tips
 172      each          chickens

I did a party this past weekend for 230 people.

Did 70 tri-tips: I like my tri-tips very well trimmed; no fat or tissue. I had 3 bowls of seasonings; fresh cracked black pepper, kosher salt, garlic powder. Season generously with each especially the garlic powder. Wrap each tri-tip in plastic and refrigerate overnight. 
Grilled directly over oak hardwood. Cook until 135-140F internal; throw meat in an empty ice chest and close the lid for about 10 min. or until ready to serve. Thinly slice across the grain. Be sure to save all the juices that will occur during slicing and pour over sliced meat when finished.

Did 172 half chickens: Mix a marinade of orange juice, pineapple juice, apple juice and fresh lemons sliced and juiced. Add a dry mix of paprika, chili powder, salt, black pepper and cumin. Mix well and pour over chicken. Add several bunches of cilantro and refrigerate overnight.

Grill directly over oak coals until done.

   8                    chicken breast halves, skinless -- bone-in
                        garlic powder -- to taste
                        salt -- to taste
                        freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
   2                    onions -- sliced
   1      cup           nonfat chicken broth
     1/2  cup           brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   arrowroot
   1      cup           chili sauce
   1      cup           sherry
   1 1/2  cups          sliced peaches

The chicken in this recipe is baked on the bone in a sweet and savory sauce, then finished off with sherry and peaches.  Try using any other fruits--either fresh or frozen that sound tasty.

Cut any excess fat from the chicken.  Place the chicken, bone side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish.  Season with the garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Broil for several minutes, until the chicken is slightly browned.  Set aside.

Coat a medium saucepan with nonstick spray.  Cook the onions over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the broth, brown sugar, arrowroot and chili sauce.  Raise the heat to high and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring constantly.  Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce over the chicken.  Cover the chicken with a piece of foil.  Refrigerate until ready to bake or continue with the next step.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Bake the chicken for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and pour the sherry and peaches over the chicken.  Bake uncovered, basting occasionally, for 30 minutes more, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is bubbling.

                  Chicken Barbecue Sauce - Jeff's Dad's

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Barbecue Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           butter
     1/4  cup           lemon juice
   2      tablespoons   horseradish
   2      tablespoons   catsup
   2      teaspoons     salt
   1 1/2  tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
     3/4  teaspoon      Tabasco

Melt butter, add everything but the lemon juice and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add lemon juice. You can rewarm if needed, but don't boil.

Place chickens on grill and baste with sauce or bake in 350F oven. I like it with more lemon juice and Tabasco.

I just discovered this recipe in the Dean and Delucca book. You cook whatever meat until it shreds, and mix a large amount of shreds with a small amount of sauce, just enough to moisten. Serve on plain soft hamburger buns. We LOVE it.

This is my dad's recipe from the 50's. Don't boil it after you add the lemon juice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        round steak cut 1/2 inch thick twice
                        -- tenderized by the butcher
   1      cup           liquid from pickled jalapenos
   2                    eggs
   2      cups          all-purpose flour
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/2  teaspoon      black pepper
                        vegetable shortening

Cut the steak into four equal portions. Pound the portions, if needed, until each is about 1/3 to 1/4 inch thick. Arrange the steaks in a shallow non-reactive dish, and pour 1 cup of the jalapeno liquid over them. Marinate the steaks in the jalapeno liquid for 2 hours. Most of the liquid will be absorbed into the steaks. Drain and blot lightly to remove excess moisture from the surface.

Mix an additional 2 tablespoons jalapeno liquid with the egg in a shallow dish. Stir together the flour, salt and pepper in another dish. Dredge the steak in the flour, then dip it in the egg, and back in the flour.

Put enough shortening into a cast iron skillet so that the steaks will be half-immersed in it during the frying. Warm the fat over medium heat. Add carefully, turn once, until the meat is fully cooked through and the crumb coating is brown and crisp, about 8 minutes total. Drain the steaks, and transfer them to a platter. Keep them warm while you prepare Cream Gravy from the drippings.

Place the steaks on separate plates, add Paris's Best French Fries and cover both generously with the gravy. Serve immediately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  pound         your favorite pasta
     1/2  stick         pepperoni*
     1/3  cup           flour
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/4  teaspoon      freshly ground pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      ground oregano (or 2 teaspoons fresh)
     1/2  teaspoon      crushed basil (or 2 teaspoons fresh)
     1/2  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      onion powder
   1      pound         Chicken breast, boneless, skinless
                        olive oil -- optional
  16      ounces        tomato sauce
   1      6 oz. can     tomato paste
     1/2  teaspoon      crushed red pepper flakes -- (or more, to taste)

* I used quartered low-fat pepperoni slices without sacrificing the taste. While I needed to use olive oil to make up for the missing rendered fat, I did save considerably on cholesterol.

Cook pasta according to package directions.

Dice pepperoni into 1/4" cubes. Cook in frying pan over medium heat, allowing the fat from it to render out. Remove from pan and set aside.

Season flour with salt, pepper, oregano, basil, garlic powder and onion powder.

Cut chicken into bite-sized chunks. Dredge chicken pieces in seasoned flour until coated. Shake off excess flour and brown in the rendered pepperoni fat (and olive oil, if needed) until the chicken is almost cooked. Remove from pan and set aside.

Whisk tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup water together in pan until smooth. Return chicken and pepperoni to pan. Bring to simmer and cook, stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes.

Serve over a bed of pasta.  Serves 4.

Categories    : Poultry                          Bbq List

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4  cup           fresh lime juice
   2      tablespoons   cider vinegar
     1/2  teaspoon      paprika
     1/4  teaspoon      angostura bitters
   1      teaspoon      hot pepper sauce -- or to taste
   1                    dried hot red chili
   1                    fresh chili -- (such as jalapeno)
   2      cloves        garlic
   2      pounds        whole chicken breast -- with skin and bone

Combine the lime juice, vinegar, paprika, bitters and hot pepper sauce in a glass baking dish.

Wearing kitchen gloves, split the dried chili with a sharp paring knife and remove the seeds.  Do the same with the jalapeno pepper.  Mash the peppers with the garlic into a smooth paste using a mortar or an electric spice grinder.  Add the paste to the lime mixture in the baking dish and combine.

Toss the chicken pieces and swish them in the marinade until they are completely coated.  Cover and let marinate overnight in the refrigerator.

Remove the chicken from the marinade and grill or broil until cooked through and burnished, about 20 minutes on each side.  Baste frequently with the marinade.  If the chicken looks like it is beginning to burn, move it farther away from the heat source.  Serve hot with chilled orange sections and plenty of napkins.

Makes 4 servings.

NOTE: "Peri-peri, the national hot sauce of Zimbabwe, is an ancestor of many of our Acadian (and other southern) hot sauces.  It enhances lamb, beef and fish as well as chicken, and a splash in the glass makes a mean Bloody Mary."

Better if left in refrigerator over night. Rub each piece of chicken with a few drops of vegetable oil. Grill the chicken using indirect heat over hot coals. Grilled over lemon wood coals with some green lemon wood chips thrown onto the coals makes this chicken even better.

TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6176

To make the relish, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and set aside, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours.

To make the marinade, remove stems of the dried California and arbol chilies and shake out and discard seeds.  Place chilies in a small saucepan with enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil, remove from heat and let sit 20 minutes to soften.  Drain and discard the water.

In a small frying pan over moderate heat, toast the cumin seeds for 2 to 3 minutes or until aromas are released.  Combine softened chilies, garlic, cumin seeds, jalapeno and red wine vinegar in a blender and puree at high speed 1 to 2 minutes, or until thick and smooth.  Add olive oil and salt and blend again until well mixed.

Place skirt steak in a large shallow glass or enamel dish and cover with marinade.  Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.  To cook, preheat a grill or broiler.  Grill steaks quickly for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until seared on the outside and pink inside.  To serve, slice steaks against the grain on the diagonal and fan slices out on a platter.  Serve the relish on the side.

   3      cups          all-purpose flour
   3      teaspoons     double-acting baking powder
   1      teaspoon      salt
   2      teaspoons     sugar
   2      medium        jalapeno peppers -- finely chopped
   2      medium        chipotle peppers -- minced
   8      cloves        smoke-roasted garlic -- minced
   1      tablespoon    onion powder
  12      ounces        beer

This is my version of a chile beer damper (Australian beer bread) recipe that originally appeared in the March/April 1994 issue of Chile Pepper Magazine. The smoke-roasted garlic and onion powder are my additions; also, I significantly upped the chile pepper content to suit my tastes.

Preheat your oven to 350F. [Note: you can also do this in a cast iron pot or oven over coals in your smoker or grill--in fact, that would lend authenticity to the end results].

Mix all ingredients together thoroughly. Put into a greased pan or pot and smooth the top. Bake for one hour, or until golden brown. Remove from heat and let cool before serving.

   1                    16 oz can pigeon peas
   6                    Habanero chilies -- roasted and chopped
   6      cloves        garlic -- finely chopped
     1/2  medium        Vidalia onion -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   olive oil
   2      cups          rice
   1                    15 oz can coconut milk
                        water
   4      teaspoons     Wyler's granulated chicken bouillon

The original recipe calls for one habanero but this version was for a bunch of chile-heads.

Rice and peas (or beans) is a very popular dish throughout the Caribbean, and perhaps because eating rice with hot foods helps to tame the fire.  (Not this rice!) The peas used in this recipe are called pigeon or gungo peas.  They are about the size of garden peas and are usually found dried.  However, cooked, canned pigeon peas are also available.  If they are not available in your area, black-eyed peas or kidney beans can be substituted.  (Not the same, however)

If using canned peas, drain and reserve the liquid.

Heat the oil in a deep frying pan over high heat.  Add the rice, and continue saut� until the rice turns opaque and golden brown.

Add the chile, garlic, and onion and saut� for a few more minutes.  Beware the fumes!!! Be careful not to let the rice brown or over brown.

Stir the peas in with the rice.  Do not stir again during cooking!

Combine the coconut milk with the bean liquid.  Add water to make 4 cups of liquid.  add to the rice and bring to a boil.  Immediately reduce the heat to simmer.

Cook uncovered until the liquid is slightly below the surface of the rice and holes form in the rice.  Cover the pot and cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.  Allow to sit covered for another 1/2 hour.

Great with jerk chicken!

   3                    Pasilla Negro peppers
   2                    Mulato peppers
   6      tablespoons   cumin seed
   6      tablespoons   coriander seed
   1      tablespoon    whole cloves
   3      tablespoons   celery seed
   2      tablespoons   ground cayenne

1. Break up the New Mexico, chipotle, and mulato chilies. Toast the chilies in small batches on an ungreased skillet, or comal over medium heat until they just begin to release their aroma. Do not let them darken or the may become bitter.

2. Toast the cumin, coriander, and cloves on an ungreased skillet, or comal over low heat until they release their fragrance and become lightly roasted, about three minutes.

3. Grind the toasted spices and celery seed (best to use a spice grinder).

4. Grind the chilies in a spice grinder or food processor.

5. Mix the ground chilies, spices, and ground cayenne. This recipe is an adaptation of one appearing in "New Southwestern Cooking" by Dille & Belsinger. Since I never have the chilies called for in the recipe, I invariably "wing it." The spices seem to be the important factor so substituting different chilies doesn't make a major difference in the finished product.

Saut� onions and garlic on med. high heat until soft.  Add everything else.  Simmer uncovered until thick.

A bourbon based glaze might be nice.  A little Worcestershire, a little brown sugar, a little bourbon.

I prefer bourbon to whiskey.  Evan Williams is a lot cheaper than JD.  Picked up 1/2 gal for $13 in New Hampshire.  Not bad for 7 yr. old sourmash.  I put 1/4 cup in my basic red sauce and in Bad Attitude chili.  Here's my latest version.

   1      6 lb.         roasting chicken
   1      32 oz can     chicken stock
   1      cup           coarsely chopped celery
   1      cup           diced red bell pepper
   1      cup           sliced carrots
   2      medium        onions coarsely chopped
   1      cup           corn kernels
   1      16 oz can     diced tomato
   1      cup           chipotles in adobo sauce
     1/2  teaspoon      thyme
                        cracked black pepper to taste
                        salt to taste 
						-- heavy Chinesesoy sauce -- optional 

Roast chicken in oven till done (Hey, smoke it if you really want to be game!), cool overnight.

Debone chicken and save all the bones and scraps. Cut meat into bite size bits removing fat and gristle. Refrigerate.

In a large stock pot add bones and carcass as well as veggie peelings, carrot butts and onion skins etc and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 2 to 3 hours, skimming and stirring occasionally.

Strain through a colander and add stock back to pot. Add celery, bell pepper, corn, onions and carrots as well as the canned stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until veggies begin to turn tender. Add chicken and canned tomato.

While soup is coming back to a simmer, take about a cup of it and put in a food processor with the chipotles and adobo. Whir it up for about 30 seconds or until the peppers are well pureed. Add salt, pepper and thyme to the soup, then start adding the chipotle puree about a quarter cup at a time, stirring and tasting for the desired pungency. Using all of it makes for a chileheads delight, but may be too much for some gringos to handle!

This makes a big old pot full which would probably serve 20 or 25 people. Good for freezing and serving at a later time.

You could use all canned stock and one of those rotisserie chickens from the store, but my life is dull and I got nothin' better to do.

I made my first batch of chipotles two weekends ago and they tasted great.  My Mexican-American friends at work gave them a positive thumbs up.

How I did it:

Preparing the smoker:

I borrowed my neighbors Cajun Cooker II water smoker (borrowing is much better than buying).  His unit has two grills, one near the top and one just above the water pan.  I put 5 lbs. of self-lighting briquettes in the bottom, and set them on fire.  I put 3 qts. of cold water in the water pan that sits above the charcoal pan.  I bought a 3 lb. bag of mesquite wood chips and soaked them in water while the briquettes got going. 
Preparing the chilies:

I picked them in my garden the morning of the smoking.  About half of the chilies were red. I washed them and cut off the tops, at the calyx. I put about 2 lbs. of standard Jalapenos and TAM Jalapeno (50:50) about two peppers thick on the top shelf of the smoker.  I prepared a second similar-sized batch of Jalapas and Fresno chilies for the second batch.

The Smoking:

When the briquettes got going, I started to put a few mesquite chips on the charcoal.  About every 15 minutes I had to add more mesquite as the smoke would stop when the mesquite was consumed.  I did the first batch of chilies for 3 1/5 hours and removed them.  I added the second batch.  Temperature in dome of smoker stayed around 170-180F.

I put all the smoked chilies on two foil-lined cookie tray and put them in the oven set at the lowest setting.  I left them in the oven to dry for about 24 hours.  I tested the chilies until they were crisp and would break when I squeezed one.  I let them cool and put them into my blender and chopped them to fine flakes/powder.  Beware of the powder, it'll make you cough big time!  I them blended them all together and was surprised how little I ended up with, about 3/4 qt. 
My powdered chipotles have a very rich Smokey flavor and are mildly hot. So far, I have used them on tacos and I tried them sprinkled on top of cream cheese spread on crackers.

   1      pound         ripe (red) jalapenos

Americans who love the smoky taste and fiery bite of chipotles have recently been hit with high prices and a scarcity of product. With prices for these smoked jalapenos reaching $15 a pound wholesale, home growers yearn to smoke their own. But the Mexicans have been fairly secretive about their techniques, and none of the books on chilies describe home smoking. After a trip to Delicos, Mexico, I think I have solved this mystery -- but the process takes some dedication. First, let's look at how the Mexicans do it.

They use a large pit with a rack to smoke-dry the jalapenos. The pit containing the source of heat is underground, with a tunnel leading to the rack. The pods are placed on top of the rack where drafts of air pull the smoke up and over the pods. The jalapenos can be whole pods or pods without seeds. The latter are more expensive and are called "capones", or castrated ones.

It is possible to make chipotle in the back yard with a meat smoker or Weber-type barbecue with a lid. The grill should be washed to remove any meat particles because any odor in the barbecue will give the chile an undesirable flavor. Ideally, the smoker or barbecue should be new and dedicated only to smoking chilies.  The quality of homemade chipotle will depend on the maturity and quality of the pods, the moisture in the pods, the temperature of the smoke drying the pods, and the amount of time the peppers are exposed to the smoke and heat. The aroma of wood smoke will flavor the jalapenos, so carefully choose what is burned. Branches from fruit trees, or other hardwoods such as hickory, oak, and pecan, work superbly. Pecan is used extensively in parts of Mexico and in southern New Mexico to flavor chipotle. Do not be afraid to experiment with different woods.

The difference between the fresh weight of the fruits and the finished product is about ten to one, so it takes ten pounds of fresh jalapenos to produce approximately one pound of chipotles. A pound of chipotles goes a long way, as a single pod is usually enough to flavor a dish.

First, wash all the pods and discard any that have insect damage, bruises, or are soft. Remove the stems from the pods before placing the peppers in a single layer on the grill rack. Start two small fires on each side of the grill with charcoal briquettes. Keep the fires small and never directly expose the pods to the fire so they won't dry unevenly or burn. The intention is to dry the pods slowly while flavoring them with smoke. Soak the wood in water before placing it on the coals so the wood will burn slower and create more smoke. The barbecue vents should be opened only partially to allow a small amount of air to enter the barbecue, thus preventing the fires from burning too fast and creating too much heat.

Check the pods and the fires hourly and move the pods around, always keeping them away from the fires. It may take up to forty-eight hours to dry the pods completely. The pods will be hard, light in weight, and brown in color when dried. If necessary, let the fires burn through the night. After the pods have dried, remove them from the grill and let them cool. To preserve their flavor, place them in a zip-lock bag. It is best to store them in a cool and dry location. If humidity is kept out of the bags, the chipotles will last for twelve to twenty-four months.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Bread, Rolls And Cornbread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           coarsely ground yellow cornmeal
   1      cup           all-purpose flower
   1      teaspoon      sugar
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1 1/2  teaspoons     baking powder
   2                    eggs -- lightly beaten

   6      tablespoons   bacon drippings
   4                    canned chipotle peppers -- pureed

These are my cooking directions as the recipe didn't cover this well:

Pre-heat oven to 400F. Heat bacon drippings in skillet until HOT while you mix all the other ingredients in bowl. When drippings are hot, pour about 4 tablespoons worth into cornbread mix and stir in. Let skillet heat a few more minutes until barely smoking then pour mix into skillet and let cook on burner for a minute. Remove from stove top and place in oven, baking until top is golden brown with darker brown patches. Test with a knife or toothpick for doneness. If it pulls out clean, its done.

1) Mix all ingredients except for tenderloin

2) Place tenderloin on sheet of aluminum foil and cover with marinade. Wrap up tenderloin and place in fridge for 20-30 min

3) Remove from foil and sear on all sides over medium coals--reserve marinade and foil

4)Place loin back in foil with remaining marinade and cook using "Weber indirect method" until done (about 175 internal)

*Some folks might disagree with the use of foil, I just can't seem to find another way to keep such a lean piece of meat juicy.

5) Let meat rest 10 min before slicing, cover with remaining marinade after plating.

Preface: From The Journey North - Torreon to Chihuahua

This part of Chihuahua is quite an important chile-growing area as well, and while the greatest part of the crop is dried, fresh chilies are also used: "chile de arbol", "guajillo" (confusingly called "cascabel" there), "jalapeno", and "chilaca" or Anaheim. The "chilaca", or "chile verde", the long slender light green chile that ranges from mild to hot, is the one featured most commonly in the cooking of Chihuahua. While it is used fresh, or dried as "chile de la tierra" or "chile colorado", there is an interesting variation: it is charred and peeled and then hung up to dry, whole, without removing seeds and veins. In this state it is known as the "chile pasado". I warn you, if you do this, 1 pound will reduce to 2 ounces. But it is well worth it because when rehydrated before cooking this chile has a delicious flavor and enhances the stews or "rellenos" or "chile con queso" in which it is used. In recent years mushroom cultivation has been introduced, and now the preferred filling for "chilies rellenos" is a mixture of mushrooms and cheese.

The crop of jalapenos, while still green, is mostly destined for the canning industry; once they ripen to red, their value is diminished. Not so many years ago they were simply thrown away in the latter stage, until Don Juventino Santos, an enterprising man from Tulancingo, Hidalgo, who was in the chile business, decided to smoke-dry them for "chipotle mora".

When we were driving out from Camargo the following day to visit the Lago Toronto, the air was filled with the aroma of smoke and chilies, and there, a few yards from the roadside, were huge rectangular cement-block structures about twelve feet high. At intervals around the base were fire boxes filled with glowing, smoking logs. Spread out in a thin layer over the slatted surface were deep red, wrinkled jalapenos - the color darkens as the smoking process progresses. A man with a shovel was turning them over from time to time. The farther we drove out of town, the more small communities ("ejidos") we saw and visited that were also dedicated to smoking chilies, and as we drove back that afternoon there were trucks tipping out their loads of the ripened jalapenos onto the newly vacated smoking beds.

This smoke-drying process takes several days in which time the weight of the chilies is reduced to one seventh that of the fresh. The smoked chilies are so cheap that one wonders how on earth anyone makes any money out of it at all. We bought sackfuls to support the local economy and distributed them lavishly to all the cooks we knew along the route back and in Michoacan.

They were extraordinarily picante, owing to the hot, dry summer. A recipe for them pickled "en escabeche" can be found in "The Art of Mexican Cooking", and following is a recipe for chipotles "en adobo".

Preserving chilies by smoke-drying dates from pre-columbian times, and the basic process, albeit with slightly different techniques is still used today.

Jalapeno chilies - ripened, smoke-dried, and prepared in a pungent sauce for chipotles "en adobo" - have taken the American gastronomic world by storm. They are everywhere, the condiment of the decade, mixed with anything and everything: in sauces, seasoning pastes, soups, salads, breads, etc. (not yet I sincerely hope, in ice cream). There are two types of "chipotles": the larger, highly smoked, tobacco-colored one and the smaller mulberry-colored (as the name implies) "mora" - not to be confused with "moritas", which are smaller. When I first came to Mexico many years ago, the larger light-colored chilies were more in evidence, canned in a light pickle, "escabeche". Today the canning industry seems to favor the "mora", possibly because its smaller size lends itself to the small cans.

Of the many brands exported from Mexico, my preference is for those packed in a darker-colored sauce, a real "adobo", rather those in a more acidic, tomato-based sauce. Of course, it is always interesting to make your own, without preservatives and fresh, for which I give a recipe here. This preparation is pungent; a milder version is given in the note that follows the recipe.

Rinse the chipotle chilies and drain. Pierce each one right through with a sharp fork or skewer, put them into the pressure cooker with water to cover, and cook at low pressure for about 15 mounts - they should be soft but not mushy. (If you are not using a pressure cooker, cook over fairly low heat, tightly covered, for 30 to 40 minutes.)

Drain the chilies, remove the stems, and wipe off any stray seeds clinging to the outside.

Set aside.

Meanwhile, cover the ancho chilies with hot water and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a blender. Add 1 cup of the water, the garlic, herbs, seeds, and bay leaf plus 4 of the cooked chipotles and blend until almost smooth.

Heat the oil in a shallow pan, add the blended ingredients, and fry for about 3 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. Add the vinegars, the rest of the water, the sugar, and the salt and cook for 5 minutes more. Then add the rest of the cooked chilies and cook over low heat, scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time to prevent sticking, until the sauce has reduced and thickened - about 15 minutes.

Store in the refrigerator or sterilize and store in a cool place.

Makes about 3 cups.

NOTE: If you prefer a less pungent version of this recipe, cook the chilies first for about 5 minutes. Drain, slit them open, and remove the seeds and what remains of the veins. Discard the water and start at the beginning of the recipe, reducing the cooking time by about 5 minutes. If you wish to have a lighter sauce, add another 6 ounces of tomatoes to the adobo.

NOTES : I either stuff and smoke this sausage or just freeze the patties. If you
stuff, don't over pack. Smoke low (175F) for two hours. It is the best for

                        ***See Directions***      

My wife, who likes to volunteer me for challenges, decided to get a goose for Christmas dinner this year.  We'd planned to have it in early afternoon, but shifted dinner to suppertime so we could lunch on the clam chowder we didn't eat on Christmas Eve because the cocktail party we'd gone to turned out to be a buffet with beef tenderloin, onion tarts, and other goodies.

I'd never done a goose myself before, and had only vague memories of helping with one many moons ago, so I did some research.  The big challenge, as you probably know, is the thick fat layer on domestic geese.  The recipes I turned up called for roasting, and I didn't want to spend too long a time cooking it, so I planned to use a Weber kettle with small fires on either side of charcoal and wood (apple, since I have an unlimited supply).  The barbecuing itself was actually uninteresting -- about two and a half hours (with the air temp at the top of the kettle in the 300's F.)  until it reached an interior temperature of 170 F in the inner thigh.  Apparently goose is hard to go too far wrong with; it doesn't dry out as badly as a lot of birds when overcooked.  The interesting part of the process was the preparation for cooking, which I got from a Xerox my wife had acquired somewhere (I don't have the reference on me, but think it was out of the old Cook's Magazine):

Choose a smallish goose; anything over 13 lb. is likely to be old and tough.  A day, or better two, before you plan to cook it, take your largest stockpot or lobster pot, fill it half full with water, and bring to a boil.  Remove the neck and innards from the goose's cavity and pluck any remaining quills with pliers.  Cut around the wishbone with a sharp knife and remove it (anyone know why they want this done?).

Puncture the goose's skin all over with a sharp point (the letter recommended a barding needle; I just used an instant-read thermometer), coming in at an oblique angle to avoid puncturing the meat below the subcutaneous fat.  Put the goose in the boiling water for about a minute (or until "goose bumps" form).  If, as is likely (and was true for me) the goose won't fit all the way into the pot, you'll have to turn it end-for-end and immerse the other end as well.  You'll want gloves for this operation, especially if you have to "double-dip."  I used disposable food-service gloves and got by, but real rubber work gloves would have given better heat insulation.

Dry the goose and put it UNCOVERED on a broiling rack in the refrigerator to dry the skin.  The skin will tighten around the bird, forcing some of the fat through the holes, though most of that will happen during the cooking process.

To cook, rub salt and pepper over the goose and put lemon juice in the cavity.  You need a BIG drip pan -- I used a 99-cent disposable turkey-roasting pan with high sides to reduce the chance that a spark would set off a grease fire.  I probably should have emptied the grease a time or two along the way, but it was cold, it was Christmas, my back hurt from injudicious lift on an oak limb on Sunday, and I didn't.  I got away with it this time; I certainly wouldn't have tried doing so with a wood that was more likely to "spit" than apple is, or that wasn't already burnt down substantially before the fat was rendered.

The result was a goose that was very good, though not perfect: the meat was firm as expected, with a good subtle smoke taste (goose, by the way, does not "taste like chicken"; more like roast beef if anything).  The skin was mostly crisp and very good (cf. Peking duck), though next time I will prick the skin more thoroughly and turn the goose more often while it's cooking (this would be a good spit-cooked item).  There were still pockets of fat that I think were mainly due to poor drainage.

   1                    7-oz can chipotle adobado peppers

   1      cup           soy sauce
   2      tablespoons   ground rosemary
   6      tablespoons   minced garlic
   4      tablespoons   dry mustard
   1                    12-oz bottle red wine vinegar
   4      cups          olive oil
   1                    20-oz can dole pineapple chunk
   1                    46-oz can pineapple juice
   1      cup           teriyaki sauce

Brought all ingredients to a simmer and let cool. Beings 2 of the chucks were in the 40 lb. range I quartered them. I then stabbed them to death again. Then I took Sysco brand Imperial real beef base, which is like a paste and rubbed all over the roasts. Next I had some Legg's Old plantation Smoked sausage seasoning and sprinkled fairly liberally over roasts and rubbed in. Put in my large marinade tub and poured marinade all over and mixed it up. Turned the roasts in the marinade 3 times over the 14 hours. Made a mop of canola oil, chili powder, black pepper and a little red wine vinegar.

Well as of 2 am this morning I have 135 lbs. of boneless chuck a turning on the spit with hickory smoke. Doing a benefit for a guy who has bone cancer and were raising money to send him to France to see his son (who is in military)get married. Been raining here so looks to be an interesting day. Trying a little different marinade I concocted so will post. Marinated for 14 hours.

NOTES : I am going to try this again!!! These biscuits not only soak up the honey, they soak up the sauce, without falling apart! Store bought bread leaves me sucking on my fingers, and many other things. I can't wait to get these buns perfect.  It will take some practice, but I am convinced it will be worth it!

Try placing on a greased cookie sheet! Instead of 2 inch balls, make them 3 to 3 1/2 inch balls. After they are on the cookie sheet, press down lightly to make something that looks like a flying saucer! Let it rise, and bake as instructed. It will take some practice, but it is worth it!

Combine all ingredients and let marinade for at least 4 hours but not longer than 12. If you are smoking the meat, 4 hours is enough but smoke with the wood you prefer for at least 2 hr/lb. If you want to grill the meat, marinate for the 12 hr. and quickly sear on a very hot grill for 15 min. Turn once for another 15 minutes and let stand for 15 min before slicing. Of course, your hot is different than my hot. While the meat is resting, grill the onions on Al foil.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ribs                             Bbq List

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      pounds        pork ribs
   3      cups          Coca-Cola or Dr Pepper
   3      cups          ketchup
   1      cup           packed dark brown sugar
   6      tablespoons   chili powder
   4      tablespoons   ground black pepper
   2      tablespoons   dry mustard
   1      tablespoon    ground cinnamon

Transfer the ribs to a large non-reactive glass or ceramic dish pour 2 cups of Coca-Cola or Dr Pepper over them.  Reserve the third cup of the soda for a sauce to be made later.  Let the ribs marinate, tightly covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated, overnight.

About 6 1/2 hours before you plan to serve the ribs, start a fire in your smoke/cooker and begin heating a quantity of coals.  Then turn your attention to the sauce.

Pour the remaining 1 cup of soda into a blender or food processor and measure in the catsup, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, dry mustard, and cinnamon.  Mix until smooth and well blended.  No need to cook this one, as least for now.

Add some well-soaked aromatic wood such as hickory or mesquite to the glowing coals in your cooker.  Set a pan filled with hot water in place, and smoke cook the ribs, covered at 220 to 240F.  for about 3 hours.

After this initial smoking, turn the ribs, slather them with the sauce, check the supply of wood and water in their respective pans, and continue cooking for another 3 hours, this time turning the ribs every 30 minutes and mopping them with sauce each time they're turned.  By the end of the 3 hours, they should have long since reached the internal temperature of 160 to 170F recommended for pork.

After the last basting of the ribs, tote the remaining sauce inside and simmer in a medium-size saucepan over low heat until quite thick.

Serve the gloriously gooey sauce in dipping bowls with the finished ribs.

 Coke has uses in barbeque besides just tenderizing meat. For a quick sauce, pour a can of Coke Classic in a sauce pan, add a bottle of catsup, stir well and cook it down to sauce consistency. That's it! 
I know of a popular restaurant that uses this as its house sauce.

                        ***BASIC FISH BRINE***
   4                    U.S. gallons water
   5      pounds        salt -- (8 cups)
   1      pound         dark brown sugar
   1 1/2  cups          lemon juice
   2      tablespoons   liquid garlic
   2      tablespoons   liquid onion

Prepare the fish by cleaning, gutting and, if desired, by cutting into fillets or chunks.  Then immerse the fish in basic fish brine for a time proportional to the weight.  Remove from the brine and rinse briefly in cold water.  Hang in a cool airy place for 3 hours or longer if necessary, until the surface is completely dry.  Hang the fish or place on racks, in the smoke oven.  Keep the temperature between 70 and 85 F.  and use a fairly light smoke.  In prolonged cold smoking it is not necessary that smoke be generated all the time.  At night, for example, it does not matter if the hardwood is all consumed, or if the fire goes out.  Simply compensate for the lost time when calculating the total smoking period.  The time required for cold smoking depends upon the time that the fish is to be kept.  The following table will give a rough guide.

: SMOKING TIME KEEPING TIME

24 hours 2 weeks
2 days 4 weeks
3 days 2 months 4 days 4 months
5 days 6 months
1 week 1 year
2 weeks 3 years

These times assume a steady of smoke and uniform oven temperatures.  Well smoked fish will for some time at room temperature, but for best preservation, each fish or piece should be separately wrapped in waxed paper or aluminum foil and refrigerated at 35F.

BASIC FISH BRINE: If liquid garlic and liquid onion are not available, garlic and onion powder may be substituted although they do not readily dissolve in water.  Alternatively, garlic cloves and onions may be crushed, but peel them first.  If a stronger flavor is desired, add a little Tabasco sauce to the brine.  Dill may be added to the brine, for those who like it.  Two tablespoons of dill salt will be about right.  Alternatively, crushed or broken dill plants may be put in the brine as they are for dill pickles.  The dill flavored brine is particularly good for making smoked or kippered Salmon.  For a subtle variation of flavor, honey or blackstrap molasses may be substituted for the brown sugar.

ALL COLD-SMOKED FISH NEED TO BE CURED. COLD SMOKING DOESN'T COOK FISH, JUST FLAVORS IT.

Now for the process:

Prepare the fish as you would for hot-smoking, using a cure or brine. In this case, however, you must add curing salts, unless the cure already has a high salt content.

Combine the ingredients, and rub well into fish. Place in a NON-METAL container for several hours or overnight, depending on the size and amount of fish. Rinse fish well in cold water, rubbing slightly to release excess salt. Pat dry, then allow to air-dry for several hours until fish acquires a glaze. Smoke as follows.

Preheat the smokehouse while fish is drying. You can use any mild wood for this, cherry, alder, or apple.

Temperature in the smoke chamber should be 70F with a light smoke. After the fish has been smoked for approx. 12 hours a heavier smoke can be applied. Smoking time can take from 24 hours to 2 WEEKS, depending on the type and size of fish, and how dry you want it. The longer the smoking time, the longer the fish will keep.

Fish can be placed in a smoke chamber and lightly smoked for about 8 hours at 80 - 90F, then densely smoked another 4 hours as you gradually increase the temperature to 130-150F. Hold the smoke chamber temperature for another 2 or 3 hours, or until the fish turns a shiny brown.

Cold smoking the fish before hot smoking it will give the hot smoked fish a stronger smoke flavor.

To store cold-smoked fish, wrap each piece in plastic wrap and foil, then refrigerate or freeze it.

NOTES : Dry Cure for Fish 
The brown sugar of this flavorful cure is especially good with salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon, though it is also excellent with other fish. This recipe makes enough cure for approximately 10 pounds of fish. Use it for fillets, steaks, or whole small fish.

First I use a Brinkmann SNPP. I've had to modify it to cold smoke fish. What I have done is used a Weber Kettle as a fire box that sits about 6 feet away from the original firebox on the SNPP. I tapped a 4 inch pipe into the top of the Weber's lid and bent it to about 70F. The 4 inch pipe is in sections that add up to about 6 feet. I then connect the other end of this pipe (smokestack) to the original firebox on the SNPP so that the smoke travels from the Weber to the SNPP a distance of about 6 feet. This really cools down the smoke. Temperature in the smoking chamber of the SNPP is about 70-80F. That's the basic crude set up. It's ugly, but it works!

This is the recipe as it appears in the March and April 1998 issue of Cook's Illustrated magazine.  I suggest to those interested in the recipe pick up a copy -- the article (not included here) is very informative about the subject.  The author suggests refrigerating the finished product overnight to allow the flavors to develop.  He also suggests adding peanut butter and/or unsweetened chocolate to enhance the earthiness and to add creaminess.  Enjoy!

By Adam Ried

Toast and grind the ancho and New Mexico chile pods.  Toast the cumin seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes and grind.

1.  Mix chile powders, cumin, and oregano in small bowl and stir in 1/2 cup water to form thick paste; set aside.  Toss beef cubes with salt; set aside.

2.  Fry bacon in large, heavy soup kettle or Dutch oven over medium-low heat until fat renders and bacon crisps, about 10 minutes.  Remove bacon with slotted spoon to paper towel-lined plate; pour all but 2 teaspoons fat from pot into small bowl; set aside.  Increase heat to medium-high; saut� meat in four batches until well-browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch, adding additional 2 teaspoons bacon fat to pot as necessary.  Reduce heat to medium, add 3 tablespoons bacon fat to now-empty pan.  Add onion; saut� until softened, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add garlic and jalapeno; saut� until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add reserved bacon and browned beef, crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, lime juice, and 7 cups water; bring to simmer.  Continue to cook at steady simmer until meat is tender and juices are dark, rich, and starting to thicken, about 2 hours.

3.  Mix masa harina with 2/3 cup water (or cornstarch with 3 Tbsp.  water) in small bowl to form smooth paste.  Increase heat to medium; stir in paste and simmer until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.  Adjust seasoning generously with salt and ground black pepper.  Serve immediately, or preferably, cool slightly, cover, and refrigerate overnight for up to 5 days.  Reheat before serving.

To cut down the heat, use 1 Tbsp. Ground Red pepper plus 1 Tbsp. cayenne.  Heat sauce as needed, for 10 minutes at 350, then dip wings into hot sauce mix.  You can double the sauce recipe if you like.  Use as much as you need to coat wings.  It will keep indefinitely.  Just shake the jar and pour as much sauce as needed into a pan and reheat to dip chicken wings.  The chef who gave me the recipe makes it a gallon at a time.  He uses the cayenne-red pepper mix, I use all cayenne.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           all purpose unbleached white flour
     3/4  cup           yellow cornmeal
   1      tablespoon    baking powder
   1      teaspoon      salt
   3      tablespoons   sugar -- up to 4
     3/4  cup           buttermilk
     1/4  cup           whole milk
   2                    eggs -- beaten
     1/3  cup           butter or margarine -- melted

Preheat oven to 425. Using about 2-3 T. of shortening, grease a 9" inch cast iron skillet. Place the skillet in the preheated oven. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients together. Blend well. In a smaller bowl add buttermilk, milk, and eggs. Add the melted margarine and mix well. Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well. Remove the hot skillet from the oven and carefully pour in the batter. Return the skillet to the oven, remembering that the skillet is still hot. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove to a plate and rub top with a stick of butter or margarine.

TIPS Have all ingredients at room temperature. Stone ground yellow corn meal works best and gives a golden color bread. Don't use no-fat margarine. They contain too much water. Mix the batter till smooth. I don't care what your Grandmother said about lumpy batter being OK. Use a seasoned cast iron skillet. You may also use a cast iron muffin pan without the paper cups. If you use any other type muffin pan the paper cups may be necessary. Spray the paper cups with PAM. Make sure the greased skillet is in the oven long enough to get hot. This will make for a crispy crust.

Roughly cut or chop the sliced hog jowls and place into a heavy pot. Peel the onions and cut into 1/4" wedges and add to pot. Add the butter beans and cover with water to a depth of the length of the first joint of your index finger.

Bring to a rolling boil and then reduce heat to a simmer (gentle boil). Allow to simmer for 2 hours and then add salt to taste. You can throw in some garlic now if you wish. Leave pan on slow simmer until the liquid is as thick as you desire. If it's still not thick enough, remove a cup of beans, mash and re-add to the pot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        flank steak
                        Salt and pepper
   2 1/2  cups          flour
                        Essence spice
   2                    eggs, beaten with 2 -- tablespoons milk

Cut the flank steak into four equal portions, crosswise. Using a meat mallet, pound out the steak, about 1/4-inch. Season with salt and pepper. Season 2 cups of the flour with Essence. Dredge the steaks in the season flour. Dip the steaks in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the steaks in the seasoned flour, coating each side completely. Add enough oil to a large skillet to fill about 1/4-inch of the pan. Heat the oil. When the oil is hot, carefully lay the steaks in the hot oil. Pan-fry the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden. Season with salt and pepper. In another skillet, render the bacon until crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onions and continue to saut� for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of flour and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Whisk in the milk and bring the liquid to a simmer, cook the gravy for 3 to 4 minutes. If the gravy is too thick add a little more milk and if too thin, cook a little longer. Remove from the heat and season with salt an black pepper. Spoon the gravy over each steak.

Yield: 4 servings

   1      cup           water
     1/4  teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      sugar
     1/2  cup           butter -- (1/4 lb.)
   4                    eggs
                        ***CRAB FILLING***
   2      cans          crab -- well drained
                        green onions -- chopped finely
                        celery, chopped finely
                        --(amounts of green onion and celery -- your taste)
                        mayo or Miracle Whip to taste
                        Salt and pepper -- pinch or two

Put water, salt, sugar and butter into pan and heat till butter is melted.  Bring mixture to a full rolling boil over high heat, add your flour all at once, remove pan from heat, and stir until mixture becomes a smooth, very thick paste that clings together and comes away from the sides of the pan.  Stir in eggs one at a time, until paste is smooth and shiny.(paste may seem thin when you begin to add the eggs, but will thicken as you continue to stir) Let paste cool about 15 minutes.  Lightly grease cookie sheet.  Take a teaspoon of paste and drop on sheet about 2" apart.  This will make about 40 miniature cream puffs.  Preheat oven to 400F.  Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden and lightweight.  You can split and fill when cool.

Crab Filling: This is approximate amounts so can add or delete whatever you like.

Note: you can use your favorite fish, chicken or meat salad sandwich filling.

Cut your puffs and put about teaspoon of filling in each.  There even hollow when you cut them open for filling.  And in keeping with Q why couldn't one take the crab and spread it on fine mesh screen and lightly smoke it.  Maybe someone on list has smoked crab and can fill us in on this? I normally make 200 to 300 for party of 75 or so.  Can't get enough of them.

Meanwhile, sift the flour and baking powder together into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the sugar.  Cut in the butter until mixture forms a fine meal.  Add the eggs, milk, vanilla and lemon rind, and mix with a wooden spoon until well blended, adding a little more flour if necessary to produce a loose but not wet batter.

Pour cranberry mixture into a 2-quart  baking dish; then pour the batter evenly over the top (scraping to cover, if necessary).   Bake for about 1 hour or till top is golden brown and cake tester comes out clean. Serve hot or at room temperature.

My grandfather Joe Luquet used to make his own hot sausage for the meat counter at Niedermeier's, the Bywater neighborhood grocery store he and my grandmother Dot Luquet n�e Niedermeier used to run at the corner of Mazant and Royal Streets. I was a little too young to remember how he did it, but it was probably very much like this excellent recipe.

A very versatile seasoning blend. Use this as a base seasoning, and build upon it in your dish.

Some versions of Creole seasoning blend contain salt -- I don't do that, because I like to control salt content separately. If you insist on this blend being salty, ala Tony Chachere's "when it's salty enough, it's perfectly seasoned!" rationale, start with 2 tablespoons salt in the blend, increasing up to 4 tablespoons depending on your sodium tolerance level.

   1 5/8  ounces        Prague powder or Instacure

In the cure, I adjust the sugar depending on how much sugar is in the rub and finishing sauce I use that day.

Mix cure ingredients in water and stir until dissolved.

Remove the membrane from the ribs, wash them well and then let them cure in refrigerator for about 18 hours. 
You can then rub them if you like and let sit in refrigerator for another 2-12 hours. Remember the cure is going to add a lot of salt and some sweetness so I don't use much of either in the rub. 
Then I smoke them at 225F-250F until I can easily tear off a rib (about 3 hours). 
Danny Gaulden's rib glaze (in this recipe archive) goes great with this. Also, I tried the peach glaze from "The Ultimate BBQ Sauce Cookbook" (ISBN 1-56352-201-2) this week and it was also great.

NOTES : I think Kit is right about not brining pork. But you may want to try curing pork. In particular, I really like to cure baby backs and hot smoke them to achieve what Kit accurately calls "bacon on a stick". In this case the cure is used solely for the texture and color it adds, not for any preservative effect.

   1      500 pound     ham, uncooked
   1      peck          and 1 1/2 gallons fine Liverpool salt

   1      teacup        black pepper

Mix these ingredients well together in a large tub, rub it into each ham with a brick, or something rough to get it in well.  Pack in a tight, clean tub and weigh down.  Let the hams remain six weeks: then take them out and rub each one on the fleshy side with one tablespoonful black pepper to avoid skippers.  Hang in the meat house, and smoke with green hickory for from ten to twelve hours a day for six weeks, not suffering the wood to blaze.  On the 1st of April, take them down and pack in any coal ashes or pine ashes well slaked.  Strong ashes will rot into the meat.

I wonder what it tasted like?  Now, I can drive down hill to my local Safeway and *buy* fresh meat government inspected.  I wonder though, are we missing something?  A lot of work, that is for sure.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

Good cures start with good meat. We raise our own hogs and fatten them on a corn based ration supplemented by whatever is available - stale bakery products, household garbage, etc. Garbage should not dominate the ration as the fat will be soft. Top hogs weigh 220 pounds and yield about a 16 pound ham. We like to cure hams between 20 and 30 pounds. Large hams with adequate fat layers age better and don't dry out as much during extended storage. 
Country cured hams will keep indefinitely but achieve their full flavor after about one year when "white flecks" appear in the muscle. We feed our hogs to 300 pounds or better but don't let them get too fat.. Some cuts may be slightly tougher with heavy hogs. Hams, shoulders and bellies may be bought from packing houses and can be ordered by butchers if you are not in position to grow your own. You may have to buy box lots but make absolutely sure that the meat is fresh and quickly chilled. Pork should be put in cure as soon as possible after chilling and trimming but, properly handled, it can  be a couple of days old. I once bought ten, 25 pound hams that had been two days in transit to the butcher and then were left in his cooler over the weekend. I lost the whole batch! Those hams had also been trimmed excessively leaving little skin and fat covering. As a result, I have gone back to raising my own so I know what I have to work with. I am supposed to talk about curing bacon and I will get around to it. As hams (and shoulders) are more valuable, demanding and risky, the entire process is keyed to the larger cuts. 
Curing and smoking facilities vary greatly. Traditional farm hamhouses / smokehouses are windowless wood frame buildings about ten feet square with a dirt floor. Wooden plank benches provide work areas for mixing the cure and salting down meat. Joists are within reach and studded with 20 penny nails for hanging meat. The dirt floor allows a higher humidity in winter and allows a smoldering fire to be built inside - both for smoking and to keep meat from freezing during extreme cold. Some hamhouses have external smoke generators - simply a firebox with a stovepipe stuck through the wall. This arrangement makes it easier to cold smoke for several days (or weeks) in the spring without exceeding 100F. and is essential if the smokehouse is made of wood and insulated.  Either the eaves are loosely fitted or there are operable vents to allow for air exchange, especially during smoking, so that there is adequate fresh air  and the smoke does not become stale and acrid. Openings are covered by fine screen mesh and the interior is kept dark to discourage skippers (larvae of a small black fly which also likes pork).  My smokehouse follows the tradition except that the walls are poured concrete and the roof is metal. The thick walls store a lot of heat and smooth out daily temperature fluctuations. I have no smoke generator or operable vents  but there is plenty of air exchange at the eaves. In places where conditions are not favorable, curing and smoking chambers with temperature and humidity controls and a smoke generator can be easily fabricated or small cuts may be cured in the refrigerator. 
My dry cure is mixed by the "pour 'til it looks right" method. My daddy showed me how. There was a request from a pork eater in Israel to provide metric measurements. Unfortunately, I don't know how to convert the  SAH (Standard American Handful)!  I buy plain (not iodized) dairy salt in 50 Lb. bags from a farm supply co-op and other ingredients from one of the warehouse retailers. 
To each 50 lbs. of salt,  mix about 1 gal. of molasses (blackstrap if you have it), about 2 pounds of ground  black pepper,  about 8 oz. of paprika and 1 SAH (about 4 oz.) of red pepper or cayenne. I use molasses rather than brown sugar so that the mixture can be packed around the meat. Color should be light brown and texture should be friable: it should pack when squeezed in the hand but crumble easily; like good loam soil  ready to be plowed. Proportions are not critical  and you can add whatever dry spices sound good. Just mix and dump until you have a mixture that looks like it will cure pork! Back when hog killin' was the norm, everyone had their own mixture. Some used plain salt or salt and pepper, others added refined sugar, brown sugar, or molasses and so forth.  You can add some salt peter for added safety if you want to. I have never used it and have no idea how much to put in. If you have no sense of adventure, buy Morton's sugar cure.

Spread a 1/2 inch layer of cure on the bench,  place meat skin side down and cover all surfaces with about 1/2 inch of cure. Force cure into the cut shank ends of hams and shoulders. I prefer laying all of the pieces out separately so I can see when  cure gets thin, but you can pile it all up and overhaul more often. During the phase of rapid cure uptake, a lot of  fluid is drawn from the meat. That is why you use rough wooden benches with the planks not too tight - dirt floors help too. Of coarse, never use treated wood in contact with food. Check the meat every few days at first then not as often as salt absorption decreases. Overhaul several times by  moving  the pieces around, making sure they are covered with cure (it won't stick to the dry skin on hams so don't worry about it). 
Bacon, at last! As a rule of thumb, smaller pieces such as bacon should stay in cure for 1.5 days per pound. This usually coincides with the time that the fresh sausage runs out. At this point I usually slice some to try. It should be salty but not too salty to eat without soaking. When you are satisfied with the cure, brush the salt off and hang. I like to let them hang for a couple of days before smoking but it is not necessary. Use cold smoke (less than 100F.) unless you plan to use it or freeze it within a few days. I use 2 fairly green hickory logs about 12" in diameter. Once burning on the dirt floor I  adjust the distance between the logs so that they smolder actively but don't flame. Hickory will keep going like this for a day or so with minimal tending. I just check it every few hours and make adjustments. Smoke does not need to be thick and heavy to flavor meat and adequate air volume is important when using green wood. I believe that smoke should enhance flavor rather than dominate.  It is not necessary to smoke bacon for preserving so an alternative would be to smoke pieces at a higher temp. before use. Bacon should be frozen or eaten before summer as it starts to get rancid if hung too long. If frozen it should be eaten prior to the next hog killin' as it will get rancid in the freezer too. 
When to skin: Some folks leave the skin on if they have a slicer that will handle it. I take it off toward the end of the curing time when it is still supple and fairly easy to remove. It can be removed before curing but the bacon may get too salty.  When you are ready for some home cured bacon, cut a slab in half and trim to the desired size. Save the trimmings for a pot of beans (you can render a lot of  the grease out in a frying pan before adding to your bean pot). Soak for several hours if too salty and chill for easier slicing. If you don't have a slicer, you can do a pretty good job with a sharp knife. Bacon is relatively easy and safe to cure as the mixture penetrates the thin slabs quickly. I would have no qualms about trying it in the refrigerator and would be interested in hearing about experiences and experiments. Hams and shoulders are more risky because of the size. The cure has to penetrate completely before warm weather or they will start to taint around the bone. A common practice is to pump some liquid cure around the bone so that it can start curing from the inside too. The addition of salt peter also helps.

Hams and shoulders stay in cure for about 2 days per pound. After the curing period, I just brush off the salt leaving a thin coating of attached spices and hang. Contrary to many recommendations, I never wash or wrap meat which I am going to hang. I has been my experience that wrappings keep moisture in promoting excessive mold and spoilage but I also live in a humid area. Some mold is desirable and does not indicate problems. There are a lot of things that can go wrong in curing hams. I remember going with my father to buy country hams as a young boy  back in the fifties (before the meat inspection laws robbed us of our heritage). Country stores would buy locally cured hams for resale. After discussing curing methods and inspecting the hams, the storekeeper would pull out a thin bladed pocket knife and insert it into the face of the ham right next to the bone (the most likely place to find spoilage and skippers). The aroma of that blade drawn from a properly cured ham is unforgettable (it is pretty hard to forget the smell of a bad one too!). Point being that encountering bad hams was enough of a problem to warrant precautions. Shoulders don't age as well as hams and should be used within six months or so. Hams only get better with age but small ones tend to dry out. I have some forty pounders that should be about prime by the turn of the century!

Skewer meat with a metal smoking rod and arrange so that a good flow of smoke can reach all sides evenly (an open grate can be used instead of rods). Hang tasso in the smoker and smoke at 150F for 5 - 6 hours. Meat should be slightly moist and completely smoked throughout.

Alternate Method
Shoulder bone can also be smoked along with the tasso. These bones can be used in Red Beans, White Beans, Gumbo and other dishes.

NOTES : Tasso is probably the most important smoked meat seasoning used in a Cajun cooking. Tasso is a highly seasoned slice of smoked pork shoulder (along with any extra scraps and pieces of pork). It is used as the primary smoked flavor for many traditional Cajun dishes. The best tasso is slightly dryer than a regular smoked ham however, not as dry as a jerky. It also has a lite sweet taste and is about twice as hot (Cayenne or Tabasco Pepper Seasoned) as regular smoked sausage.

NOTES : This was my second attempt at this recipe, CyberSauce created by the fine folks on Rick Thead's BBQ List. This recipe varies from the actual ingredients submitted by some list members. The nuoc nam was omitted because I didn't have any on hand. I substituted lime juice in place of lemon peel because I like limes. I was going to create a mild and a hot version of this sauce, so in this recipe I declined to use the chipotle peppers, which I think would have been great. I'm not too fond of rosemary so I chose not to use it. I thought the sauce should be sweeter so I added the molasses as a last minute idea. And last but not least, the first batch I made I included the pickling spices but left it out of the second batch as I thought the flavor was overwhelming. I hope no one takes offense to my omitting some of the ingredients. The sauce turned out very good and I'm sure some of you could improve it even more.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2  cups          smoked chicken, turkey, beef, pork
                        or Chorizo
   1      can           pork and beans, 1/2 liquid reserved
   1      can           red kidney beans -- drained
   1      can           black beans -- drained
   1      can           tomato sauce -- optional
   2      medium        Granny Smith apples, cored and peeled -- diced
   1      medium        onion -- diced
                        jalapenos to taste
   1      bottle        barbecue sauce
   1      bottle        maple syrup

Drain the kidney and black beans and dump them into a colander, drain the Pork N' Beans, and save about half the liquid, or substitute a small can of Tomato Sauce.

Dump the Pork N' Beans in the colander with the other two, and rinse with cold water.  Pour the reserved Pork N' Beans liquid, or tomato sauce into a large stewpot and place on the stove on medium low to low heat.  Dump in the beans.

Add the meat, chilies, apples and onions.

Add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the Pancake/Waffle syrup.  Substitute Brown Sugar if you like.  Sweeten to taste.

Now add, in enough barbecue sauce to make a very thick, stiff stew.  Be very careful, remember that as this cooks, the liquid from the apples and onions will thin this out a bit as it heats up. You want it just liquid enough to heat thoroughly on low.  Add more barbecue sauce if you need it.

Heat and simmer, and be sure to keep stirring from the bottom, with a wooden spoon, about every ten minutes or so.

Pickle is a generic term for brine and/or vinegar solutions used to preserve meat and vegetables. There is no standard recipe for curing meats with dry cures or brines as every region (and family) had their own way of formulating their cures. Some just used salt, others added pepper and spices, most added sugar of some kind to moderate the saltiness and keep the meat soft and many used saltpeter or Prague powders to facilitate the cure, combat botulism and turn the meat pink. I use salt, pepper, molasses, red pepper, and paprika with pork. The easy way to pickle is to get some Morton's sugar cure or Tender-Quick and mix with water according to the instructions. These formulations contain salt, dextrose and nitrate cure in the proper proportions. You will need a ceramic or food grade plastic container and sufficient room in your refrigerator (unless it is winter where you are).

To make your own, mix up a salt brine that will float an egg (generally around 1.5 cups salt per gallon of water). Use plain salt - not iodized table salt. Add about 1/4 as much sugar (brown, white, molasses, corn syrup etc.) as salt. About 1/2 as much ground black pepper as sugar and some red pepper and paprika as you wish. I don't use nitrates in most of my cures but it is recommended. You can buy saltpeter at a drug store or Prague powder from a sausage makers supply house. Leave bacon and side meat in cure about 2 days per pound or 2-3 weeks overhauling (moving the pieces around) every few days.

   1      gallon        cold water add:
   1 1/2  cups          salt*

     1/2  ounce         maple flavoring
  12      ounces        ginger ale

Alternatively, use: 1/2 tablespoon ginger (ground, or minced) in place of the garlic and onion.

* Table salt is not recommended because of the iodine. I usually use dairy salt which is just a good quality sterilized fine salt. I buy it from a farm supply store in 50 pound bags for curing meat and fish. Kosher salt works fine too, it just dissolves a little slower.

Cover birds completely with brine and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, remove from brine and drain while preparing smoker. Rinse birds well inside and out. Smoke at around 250F (measured at grate level) to an internal temperature of 170F in the thickest part of the thigh. Basting with butter every few hours will give you a beautiful golden-brown skin.

 For chicken, I use a marinade and mop based on ginger ale and vinegar with ginger, garlic powder, salt, turmeric, hot sauce, cayenne powder, and Old Bay for flavor. These are my standard and favorite spices but I also look through the cabinet to see if anything else sounds good at the time. No measurements - I just pour in what I think is right for the amount of chicken. When the mixture passes the smell and taste test, I dump in the chicken. After the chicken has marinated, I boil the liquid (for safety) and use it as a mop.

                        black and/or red pepper

There are probably as many different variations of jerky recipes out there as there are jerky lovers.  This is a BBQ List and most of the posts deal with standard BBQ issues, briskets, ribs, butts, *cookers*, grills, smokers and their related mops and sauces.  Occasionally, there are posts outlining sausage making, which is an art form of it's own and is sometimes difficult to put a finger on precisely how to 'clone' a closely guarded family or industry secret.  The recipes posted here were of great interest to me and I admire the effort from those who shared with us - not exactly true BBQ, but invaluable savvy nonetheless.  Along the same line, I would like to share a jerky making process that goes back a long way, before refrigerators, before electricity.  To the best of my knowledge it has never been written down, just passed along from one old timer to the next - until now....Showing a person how to do something is one thing, but putting it into words is,......an incommodiously arduous task?

The Meat: Generally, the lean scraps from most venison (elk, deer, caribou, antelope and moose) work very good.  Bear is greasy(sorry Bear), as is pork.  Buffalo is similar to beef and makes good jerky.  The best cut of beef that will yield the most usable lean meat is the top round.  If you like turkey, use large bone in breasts and remove the bone.  I haven't done reptiles, but what the hey, if that's your bag give it a shot.  The meat should be reasonably aged, at least kept cool for a week or so after it's dressed out and skinned.  It is important to trim as much fat off as possible, even if you have to cut it out or scrape it off.  The fat will not take salt very well when the meat brines, it will become rancid and grow mold quickly.  Cut the meat with the grain, into strips as big around as your thumb (3/4-1" square) and as long as possible.

The Brine: This is a self brining method and works in two stages, dehydration and rehydration.  The ingredients needed are: A kiln dried medium salt.  Most feed stores have 50# bags for about $3.  which will make about eight thousand pounds of jerky.  Medium salt is about the size of salt that comes on a pretzel.  Molasses.  I use Brer Rabbit light or Grandma's.  Brer Rabbit comes in pint bottles and have a small top that you can pour a nice 'string' from.  Grandma's comes in a large mouth bottle and it's best if you transfer it to some sort of a squeeze top ketchup or pancake syrup bottle (1 pint = about 20# of meat).  Black Pepper, medium grind or coarse - your choice.  If you like it hot, use red pepper flakes instead, if you don't like pepper leave it out. 
This brine process goes easier and more quickly if you have a few extra happy hands joining in - the kids, the wife and myself usually make it a project and when it's done everyone gets to pat each other on the back.  Since we're all together and helping each other, some interesting conversations usually surface.  Anyway, you will need a flat bottom non-corrosive container and lid, a Tupperware storage bin, a plastic bus tray or a stainless steam table pan will work well.  The size depends on the amount of meat and the room in your refer - the lids keep things out and are handy for stacking the containers.  Salt the bottom of the pan evenly, making sure to get in the corners as well.  This may not be as easy as it sounds.  Put a few pounds of salt in a bowl, cup your fingers together and scoop out about a half a handful - not in your palm.  Shake your hand back and forth across the top and about a foot above the top of the pan.  As the salt starts to leave your hand, slowly open your fingers and let the salt run through evenly.  Hand salting may require some practice.  Practice salting the bottom of the pan until it becomes comfortable and the coverage is without gobs or streaks or voids.  If this method becomes too frustrating, a shaker top jar works too - a mayonnaise jar with the metal lid poked full of holes by a 16 penny nail.  The coverage amount should be between light coverage (barely covering) and full coverage (completely covering) - the only comparison I can think of, is sugar on a pie crust, or, sugar on your cereal.  You don't want it too salty, so, one might consider their first batch of jerky experimental and take it from there. 
String the molasses.  Same kinda deal as the salt, hold the bottle about a foot above the pan, start moving it from side to side and pour.  When the molasses starts running try to get a 'string' about the size of a pencil lead and let it crisscross the pan bottom over the salt.  Once the strings are even in one direction, change directions (perpendicular) and string evenly across again.  Don't forget the corners.  When it's done it will be an even grid about 1/2" square covering the pan bottom.  Good luck...  don't worry, 10-12 layers and you'll be able to sign your name with it.  The pepper will vary as to individual taste.  One note though, pepper almost doubles its intensity as it soaks and is easy to overpower the finished product.  I would recommend that a light dusting would be sufficient for most people (about the way you would pepper a baked potato).  Red pepper flakes, even more so.  Again, hold the pepper can about a foot above, and dust it evenly - good, you remembered the corners.  Layer the meat strips across the bottom of the pan one at a time.  Starting on one side, place the strips next to each other without overlapping and with all of the strips running in the same direction.  Work the meat across until the layer is complete, without voids.  Pat the surface, edges and corners down smooth and flat.  Salt, molasses and pepper the surface as was done to the bottom of the pan to start.  The second layer of meat is done the same, but it is ran perpendicular to the first layer.  Pat smooth, salt, molasses and pepper.  Each additional layer is placed perpendicular to the layer before it.
Continue layering the meat until it reaches to a level about 2" from the top of the pan.  The last layer, or partial layer, gets the salt, molasses and pepper treatment as well. 
This brining method will cure the meat in two days.  Place the pan(s) in the refrigerator, cover and let sit undisturbed for the first day (refrigeration is not necessary if prepared in a cool climate 35-45F).  After about 24 hours the meat should be 'turned'.  Dig your hands in the pan and separate all of the strips, turning it over several times to get the meat redistributed into a random order.  Mash the meat back down into the brining juices (at this point the juice will be thin and watery), cover, and let sit for another day.  I usually taste the juice at this point--if it tastes too salty the meat can be rinsed with water, but it will not be as good. If the salt is right it will have a slightly sweet, peppery flavor. During this next day the meat will soak up the brine juices and when the meat is removed before smoking, it will have a 'candied' texture--sticky and pliable.  There should be very little, if any, brine solution left in the pan.  The meat will have soaked up the brine and be somewhat swelled up, as compared to the first turning.

Smokehousing the meat: The smoking process will require a smokehouse or smoking unit that is capable of maintaining 80-90F.  If there is a small volume, piping the smoke from an external source will provide a cooler smoke, and a hot plate or a few briquettes/lump charcoal could provide the heat source.  In a medium size unit (refrigerator size), a cast iron frying pan with chips set on a hot plate will work - although it may be difficult to maintain a constant temperature.  The more volume, the easier it is to control the temperature.  I would recommend that a fire be built and maintained throughout the smoking process, which will take from 48 to 70 hours - depending upon the thickness of the meat.  The smokehouse that I use is medium - large (350) cu. ft., it will maintain a good smoky 80-100F with 2-3 half gallon milk jug sized pieces of wood burning.  Use seasoned, barkless wood - your choice, I use red alder, apple, plum, cherry, oak, pear and some of the best I've ever done was with some 75 year old grape stumps.  Citrus works good too.  Get the smokehouse going and rack or hang the meat while the temp becomes stabilized.  If you rack the meat, place it *without* the pieces touching each other - just enough room to run a finger between the strips.  Stainless 3/16" rod sharpened on both ends works good for hanging - again, leave some space between the strips.  As you place the strips, run them through your thumb and index finger to squeegee off any excess brine.  Before placing the racks or skewers into the smokehouse, coarse black pepper or additional red pepper flakes may be added - for those who like lotsa zip.  Load the smokehouse and leave the door cracked open for the first couple hours, or until the surface of the meat has dried to the touch.  Close the doors, poke the fire and keep an eye on the temps for a couple of days.  Don't worry about the meat spoiling if the fire goes out.  The meat is cured.  It's said that the old timers used to make their jerky while they traveled.  When they made camp at night they would hang the jerky over the campfire until dawn, when they broke camp they simply packed up the jerky and continued smoking the next night.  This process takes about 4-5 days and is worth every minute.  Probably the two most important items would be too much salt and too much heat.  If you decide to try this method, I garr-own-tee you'll never find another piece of store bought jerky that even comes close.

NOTES : I would like to share a jerky making process that goes back a long way, before refrigerators, before electricity.  To the best of my knowledge it has never been written down, just passed along from one old timer to the next - until now....Showing a person how to do something is one thing, but putting it into words is,......an incommodiously arduous task?

                        ***See Directions***      

Drain 2 cans of B&M, or Bush's "baked beans" (Campbell's pork and beans will work in a pinch).  Drain 75% or more of liquid from beans and discard (the liquid, not the beans).  Pour beans into baking dish (no lid required).  In a skillet, fry 4 thick slices of HICKORY smoked bacon well done, pat dry, and place in freezer so that it becomes brittle while preparing other ingredients.  Now fry 4 more slices of bacon until medium done, and set aside.

Drain all but 2 or 3 tablespoons of bacon grease out of skillet and save for other recipes.  Saut� 1 small onion, 1 small green, and 1 small red (if available) bell pepper for 3 or 4 minutes in hot bacon grease.  Pour saut�ed onions, peppers, and bacon grease into beans.  In a cup, mix 2 tablespoons of yellow mustard, 4 or 5 tablespoons of your favorite BBQ sauce, 3 tablespoons of dark brown sugar, or 5 tablespoons of molasses, and pour into beans.  Crumble or dice the cold bacon with a good chef's knife, and stir into beans.  Place medium-done bacon slices on top of the beans and bake in oven at 350F for about 45 minutes, or in your pit until thick and rich.  Hope you guys like this as well as we do.

     1/4  teaspoon      baking soda
   1      teaspoon      baking powder
   1      tablespoon    salad oil
   1      tablespoon    sugar
   1                    egg
   1      cup           buttermilk

Mix all dry ingredients, and put GREASED (use Crisco or something similar) 10 inch cast iron skillet into 425F oven.  Let skillet get hot enough that it starts to smoke a little, and take out of oven. Take a small hand full of cornmeal, and slightly coat bottom of hot skillet as soon as it comes out of oven.  Mix oil, buttermilk, and egg into dry ingredients--shouldn't take over 15-20 seconds, and poor into HOT skillet.

Let mixture bake at 425 on medium high rack in oven until light to medium brown on top. Takes about 17-20 min.  Take out of oven, turn over on wire rack, and let cool. Best darn cornbread you ever ate. Promise.

I'm assuming that you have a cured ham. If it's a bone in, cured ham, here is a good way to finish it. Most hams of this style are skinned in most areas, but will have a few sections where the skin (hide) is still on. Especially around the tapered end going toward the end of the bone. Cut the skin off with a good sharp knife, being careful not to cut or remove the fat under it. You're not really concerned about deep cooking since it is actually already cooked. What you are interested in is giving it a better and richer flavor. Therefore, you don't need a very hot fire, but a low to medium fire with good smoke. The reason I like to keep the smoke a heavy medium is because the meat won't be on the pit that long, compared to a raw ham. The reason I like a low to medium heat is to extend the smoking time a bit. Bring smoker up to about 225 to 230F and try to keep it in that range. Make sure you have an oven thermometer placed about an inch or two away from the ham. This will guarantee accuracy. Smoke ham until it reaches about 150, no higher than 160F internally. Prepare this finishing sauce: 1/3 cup prepared mustard, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 to 1/3 cup vinegar or beer. Mix these ingredients together in a large cup or bowl and bring to warm in a microwave, etc. Stir again. This will insure that all is blended well. If you feel you need more, just double the recipe. If you feel it is too thick, add more vinegar or beer...if too thin, cut these back a bit. You don't want it too thin. Baste ham with mixture about 30 minutes, then again at about 15 minutes, before ham is ready to be removed from smoker. If you like, you can mop ham one more time as soon as it is taken off the pit. Add pieces of pineapple and maraschino cherries to top of ham about 30 to 45 minutes before it's done. You can hold these down with toothpicks. Makes it look real pretty!

             Danny Gaulden's Great Grandma's Treasured Rolls

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Bread, Rolls And Cornbread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      cups          flour
     1/4  cup           sugar -- up to 1/3
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/3  cup           melted shortening--be sure it's not rancid
   1      large         egg
   8      ounces        warm water
   1      packet        active dry yeast.

I use Pillsbury or Gold Medal "bread flour". They work best because they have a higher gluten content, but recipe will work fine with regular flour as my Grandma made it.

I like to use my bread machine to do the mixing and kneading work. It is much easier. If you have one, do this: Combine all dry ingredients together, then add wet ingredients and yeast. Put bread machine on dough cycle and let it do the work. After dough cycle has finished, place dough on floured work table, and grease hands with a little lard or shortening. Pinch dough off into large egg sized chunks and roll in hands a bit to shape, then place roll on GREASED baking pan. If dough tries to stick to your hands, re-grease hands, or shake a little flour on the dough to firm it up. Continue doing this until all dough is used.

Recipe should make about a dozen rolls. Space the rolls about 1/2 inch apart for high risers, or 1 inch apart for a rounder roll. I like'em both ways, depending on the mood I'm in that day. Cover roll pan with a slightly warm damp towel or cloth and let rolls rise until almost double in size, then bake at 350F for 20 minutes. After about 15 minutes, you can remove rolls from oven and butter the tops, then finish baking. This is optional.

If you don't have a bread machine, or want to do it with a mixer or by hand, proof the yeast by mixing the yeast with 1/2 of the warm water, and about 1 or 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Let stand on the side in a large cup or small bowl while mixing the other ingredients in another bowl. The yeast mixture will start to froth and works as a jump starter. After mixing the remaining ingredients, add the yeast mixture, and knead dough until smooth, shinny, and elastic--10 minutes or more.

Let the sponge rise in a greased covered bowl until double in size, then beat down, and kneed again for a few minutes. Form rolls, place in greased pan and follow above instructions.

For a fantastic pulled pork bun, form dough into larger, flatter rolls, about twice the size of an egg and bake for about 5 to 8 minutes more. Add sesame seeds for an extra treat, if desired. Hope all of you find this old recipe an addition to your "good recipe list".

   1      large         can of Pet milk
   2      small         cans of Pet milk

   1      tablespoon    or more of vanilla extract
                        water as much as needed

Try this one. Mix all ingredients together, but do not cook them. Makes one gallon.

Remember that you don't fill barrel all the way to the top. Leave a couple of inches for expansion of the ice cream as it freezes. This recipe is the best I've ever made for a down home, homemade flavor. However, it is not for folks that are afraid of raw eggs. Another Gaulden original, for better or worse.

                        ***See Directions***      

To me, one of the biggest problems people have with making refried beans is getting the water level right, after they are cooked and ready to be mashed.  If you leave too much water in the beans, and mash them, they will be runny, and you got a problem.  If you take out too much of the water, they will be too dry, and it can be a hassle to add it back into the already mashed beans. 
After the beans are cooked (please cook with some hickory smoked bacon, and what ever else you want in them), ladle out the water level until it is about 1/8 to 1/4 inch above the beans...just a thin layer of water left on top of the beans.  Save ladled out juice just in case the beans are too dry. 
Mash beans while still hot. Place beans in a casserole dish, sprinkle diced onion on top of them, and bake, uncovered, in oven at 350F for about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkled long horn grated cheese on top of the beans, and put back in oven until cheese melts. 
The other way we like to do ours is this.  After mashing beans, let cool so they become more firm.  Take a spatula and remove a portion of mashed beans from container, place in a medium hot Teflon coated skillet (they can tend to stick in a non coated skillet), and brown beans on bottom side. 
Flip beans over and brown top side.  While browning top side, add diced onions and grated cheese to browned side and let cheese melt.

 Cut up Jack, Swiss, or whatever you like, and put in a metal mold, or bowl. Put in smoker and place it as far away from the heat as possible, and put the smoke to it.  Guess what...this is one time that you don't want a lot of heat, and a cooler climate will work great for you. 
After about an hour and a half, place cheese into a little hotter smoking area, if it hasn't melted, and melt it. Keep the smoke on it! Take out of pit, and put in refrigerator, and chill. Take out of mold, and enjoy!  The cheese will be a little drier than before smoking, but very good.

After the ribs come off the pit, I baste them with a quick coat of an old Southern recipe of vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar, for an added deeper, richer, cherry appearance, and flavor.  Works great for me, and when you open your BBQ House, you might want to give it a try!

                        ***See Directions***      

Okay, Bear, here is the magic formula for pulled pork barbecue according to none other than Smokey Pitts, Professor Of Barbecue. He told me he would have to shoot both of us if I told you where he got it.  So, its probably best that I just say that he got it directly from the horse's mouth.

"The cooking temperature for a pork shoulder really needs to be 275-300F. As far as a good rubbing sauce, ... put a fine layer of salt on (the) shoulders prior to cooking to: a) help the shoulder to brown b) help to open the pours to allow the excess grease to properly drain. 
You should also start the shoulder cooking on the "face" side ( opposite of the skin side ) for the first 2 hours, and then rotate every hour after that. The shoulder should be done in 10 hours. A good way to tell if the meat is done is to stick a meat-fork in the end of the shoulder and there should be no resistance when pulling the fork out."

I've had these folks barbecue many times, and believe me, the formula works! Seems to me that you should consider abandoning that 225F thing and get the temperature on up there where it should be for a proper pulled pork barbecue. I know of no barbecue joint worth its salt that cooks pork over wood coals for 16 hours.  Indeed, there's one in Raleigh on my "Best of the Best" list
(http://www.ipass.net/~lineback/jnts-a.htm) who gets whole hogs done in 5 to 6 hours.

The point of my posting was that the time varies according to cooking conditions.  In addition to precipitation, the time is also affected by the ambient temperature, humidity, whether the smoke is rising or hugging the ground, the pork, the kind and condition of the wood, the cooker, location in the cooker, etc.

   1      large         onion -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   vegetable oil
  24      ounces        canned tomatoes -- drain 1/2 the juice
   1 1/2  cups          cider vinegar
   1      cup           ketchup
     1/4  cup           orange juice
   2      tablespoons   mustard, yellow (like French's)
   2      tablespoons   dark brown sugar -- packed
   2      tablespoons   regular sugar
     1/2  tablespoon    paprika, sweet Hungarian is best
     1/2  tablespoon    salt
     1/2  tablespoon    black pepper
     1/2  tablespoon    chili powder
     1/2  tablespoon    red pepper flakes
   2      teaspoons     black pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      ground cumin

1. Saut� the onion and oil in heavy saucepan for 5 minutes or so. Add the remaining ingredients and let it simmer for an hour or 2 (until it thickens a bit and the flavors have a chance to fight it out and become one). Note: You may want to cut back a little on the heat at first (chili powder, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, black pepper) as this stuff is hot. After it's cooked for an hour, gradually add the desired amount of heat until you reach your limit. Let it simmer just a tad longer and move on to the next step.

2. Let the sauce cool down so it's easy to handle without burning your self. Take a hand blender and puree the stuff. You could also pour the sauce into your upright bender and puree it. I find it easier to use the hand blender.

3. Take your best pulled pork and put however much you want into a pan. Add as much sauce as you like to the meat and get it all nice and hot together.

4. Pile your pulled pork and sauce mixture on a sandwich roll and enjoy.

The way I usually do it is perform step one on Friday night while I'm rubbing down my butt with my favorite rub. Saturday morning I fire up the smoker and smoke my butt all day. Saturday afternoon I continue with step 2 of the sauce. I warm the sauce up a little bit and puree it. When the pork is done, I go to step 3.

NOTES : OK, I guess it's time for my contribution. This is a sauce that I use to make pulled pork sandwiches. It's a work in progress, but it's pretty tasty as is. I don't know if I have ever finished perfecting a recipe. They just seem to keep evolving. I'm very BBQ starved in this area, so I don't have a lot to compare my recipes with. I've just been going with what tastes good to me, and this one do taste good to me.

                Sides

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  32      ounces        pork and beans
     2/3  cup           Heinz Ketchup
     1/4  bottle        Heinz Cocktail Sauce
   1      tablespoon    onion flakes
     1/4  cup           honey
     1/4  cup           Grandma's brand molasses
   6      rashers       bacon

Preparation:
Dump the pork and beans in a Pyrex dish. Stir in the onion flakes, ketchup, cocktail sauce, honey, and molasses. Cut the bacon into 1-inch strips and lay on top. Place a lid over the dish and bake in a 325-degree Fahrenheit oven for at least an hour or until the bacon is done.

Vary the sweetness by adjusting the honey content. The horseradish in the cocktail sauce provides the hot counterpoint. Adjusted it accordingly. The amount of onions are a matter of taste, but they should not overpower the flavor of the beans. Lean bacon adds more flavor than does fatty. Baking the beans for a longer period of time improves the flavor, but they are best when served moist. Therefore, care must be taken (1) to reduce the heat after an hour or so and (2) to remove the beans from the oven well before they begin sticking to the sides of the dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2                    7 pound racks of pork ribs
                        ***RUB***
     1/2  cup           ground black pepper
     1/2  cup           paprika
     1/2  cup           sugar
   2      tablespoons   kosher or sea salt
   4      teaspoons     dry mustard
   2      teaspoons     cayenne pepper

The night before...

The ribs should be trimmed of all hard fat and the membrane removed from the underside. To remove it, poke a hole and run your finger under the membrane, then rip it away.

Rub both sides of the ribs with a thick coat of the rub.

Place the ribs in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.

(Thanks to Smoke & Spice by Cheryl and Bill Jamison, published by The Harvard Common Press, Boston, Massachusetts, $14.95, for the inspiration for this rub. If you are only planning to buy ONE barbecue book, this is it!)

The next day. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature.

Start a fire in your Weber Grill or smoker with charcoal. As the coals turn gray add hard wood chunks or water soaked wood chips. Bring the smoker temperature to between 210 and 225F by adjusting the vents. Hold this temperature throughout the smoking (90 minutes) by adding more wood or charcoal.

Place the ribs on the rack and smoke cook them, in heavy smoke, for at least two hours. Add wood or chips every 30 minutes or so. The ribs should have a dark "crust" formed by the smoke clinging to the rub. Try not to knock it off when handling them, that is where the flavor is!

Preheat the oven to 225F. Place the ribs on racks over cookie sheets and place in oven. Cook for three hours, or until the rib bones are easily removed when you twist them. These are called "dry ribs". No extra spices or MOP was used in the cooking process.

To make juicier ribs, brush them with barbecue sauce (the recipe follows) and cover with aluminum foil to bake for the last hour.

Ribs can be made a day or two ahead and reheated in a warm oven (the way restaurants do!)

Serve with barbecue beans, coleslaw, potato salad, and plenty of cold beer.

NOTES : This recipe is for TWO seven pound racks of pork ribs. I get them at BJs or
Costco/Price Club. They seem to have consistent quality at a reasonable
price. This is enough to feed six hungry folks.

   4                    4 pound chickens-quartered
     1/4  cup           vegetable oil
   4      teaspoons     thyme
   2      teaspoons     crushed red pepper
                        salt and freshly ground black pepper

Light a grill, preferably charcoal. Rub the chicken with the oil and season with the thyme, red pepper, salt and black pepper. When the fire is medium hot, arrange the chicken, skin side down, on the grill. Cover and cook, rotating from time to time, so the fat is rendered, about 10 minutes. Turn the chicken, cover and continue cooking until almost cooked through, about 15 minutes longer. Uncover and generously spoon the True Texas Barbecue Sauce all over the skin. Turn the chicken skin side down and grill, basting and turning so it doesn't burn, until the pieces are nicely glazed and slightly charred, about 10 minutes. Serve hot off the grill.

1.  Using a 3 to 3 1/4 pound roasting chicken, remove the wings at the second joint and reserve.  Lift up the skin of the neck to expose the flesh and, using the point of a small knife, follow the contour of the wishbone to get it loose.

2.  Pull the wishbone out.

3.  Place the chicken on its breast, and cut down the backbone to expose the meat.

4.  Following the carcass with your knife, begin cutting the meat from the bone.  Cut the joint at the shoulder.   Cut on top and around the breastbone and on the other side.  This is not really complicated; you simply separate the meat from the bone as you go.  Do not worry about the leg, shoulder, and wing bones.

5.  Remove the carcass in one piece.

6.  Cut around the bone of the thigh to free it of meat.  Holding the tip in one hand, scrape with your knife, "pushing" the meat from the bone.  Separate the thighbone at the joint between the thigh and drumstick.  The drumstick bone is left in.

7.  With a large knife, cut the tip of the drumstick and...

8.  "push" the flesh back to expose the bone.

9.  Cut the tip of the wing bones.

10.  You will notice that there are 2 fillets loose on the breast.  Pull them off and position them lower than the breast, where there is no meat on the skin.  Most of the surface should be lined with meat.

                        ***See Directions***      

Cut vine-end off, slice jalapeno in half, cut out seeds and rinse.  (Leave a few seeds if you want a little heat)

Fill jalapenos with salsa favored cheese whiz(or any semi-melted cheese) and place on cookie sheet.  Be quick

When cookie sheet is full place in freezer for two hours or until jalapenos are frozen solid.

Mix a milk and egg batter.

Pour a couple cups of your favorite fish fry coating in a gallon size Ziploc bag.

Dip the frozen jalapenos in the milk and egg batter and place in the Ziploc bag, shake well.  Pour coated jalapenos back on cookie sheet and continue until all jalapenos are coated.

When all jalapenos (keep jalapenos separated) are coated place full cookie sheet back in freezer.

When frozen it is usually better to place a second coating on the jalapenos following the instructions above again.

Then freeze on cookie sheet.  When frozen place jalapeno popper's in a gallon size Ziploc bag and deep fat fry when needed.

Freezing the jalapenos on the cookie sheet keeps them from freezing together.

When deep-fat frying frozen jalapenos at 350F take about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes to cook.  Please watch.  If you cook them to long your cheese will melt through the coating.

Place the bird in a large plastic bag and allow to disperse throughout the bird for at least 2 hrs.  Turn the bag and massage the bird from time to time.

Optionally you can make a rub of the dry ingredients and rub over the surface of the bird after the first hour of marinating.

Preheat the cooking oil in a kettle large enough to hold the entire bird. to 350-375.  Tie the legs of the bird together with wire.  It helps hold the bird together and provides a way to lift it in and out of the oil.

Carefully place the bird into the oil and fry 3 1/2-4 min per lb.  You should carefully time your cooking as each cooker has it's own  peculiarities.  The resulting bird is tender and tasty and very juicy.

                        prepared mustard
                        Worcestershire sauce

Speaking of mustard - deviled turkey legs have been a family favorite since the '50s. Simply make 5 or 6 lengthwise slits to the bone. fill the slits with mustard and sprinkle heavily with Worcestershire sauce. Traditionally, the legs are then simmered for about an hour in a covered cast iron frying pan. A lot of the mustard cooks out and combines with the Worcestershire and juices steaming the meat - Wonderful!

Last week I tried this uncovered in the smoker. The temp was higher than I wanted (about 350F) so the legs cooked fast and were dryer and not as tender as the frying pan method - but still very good. Next time I may try wrapping in foil for part of the cooking time and/or using a lower temp.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 8    Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           sugar (for caramel on bottom)
   1      quart         whole milk
     1/2  cup           sugar
   1                    vanilla bean
   4      whole         eggs
   6                    egg yokes

1. Dump half a cup of sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and turn on the  heat to medium-high. When the bottom layer of sugar has melted and started to color, turn the heat up to high and stir continuously with a wooden spoon  until all of the sugar is melted and a bit frothy and is a uniform medium brown. Pour the syrup into a mold -- I used 9" Pyrex pie pans -- and swirl around so that the caramel completely covers the bottom and comes part way  up the sides. Set aside and let cool completely.
 2. Pour a quart of whole milk into a saucepan, add half a cup of sugar and a vanilla bean, and turn the heat to medium. Bring the milk to a simmer and  cook gently for around 15 minutes. You should boil the milk down by around a cup. Set aside and let cool  completely. 
3. Put four whole eggs and six egg yolks into a large bowl and mix with a fork.   Add the cooled milk and mix thoroughly, then strain through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. (Retrieve the vanilla bean, rinse with cold water,  and dry on paper towels if you'd like to reuse it for something else.) Pour the eggs and milk into the prepared mold. Place the mold into a larger pan and fill with boiling water to about halfway up the sides of the mold. Place into a preheated 350F oven and cook for two hours or until a toothpick stuck in the  center comes out clean. Take out of the oven and place on a rack and cool.   When at room temperature, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
 4.  To serve, bring the flan back to room temperature. When the caramel has become completely liquid again, place a large plate over the flan and invert.  Slice into eight slices. 
Serves eight normal people.

Combine all ingredients in a jar.  Tighten lid and shake until blended.  This sauce may also be served at room temperature or heated.

"This is a simple flavor enhancer", Remus tells me.  "It's thin enough to read today's headlines through....but not so thin that a politician can." Remus Assures me that this authentic sauce can be used as a mop during cooking and as a dip after your meat has been taken off the grill.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 6    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      dozen         hard boiled eggs, peeled
   2      large bunch   fresh dill, chopped
   2      large jars    generic dill spears
   2      large         yellow onions -- sliced into rings
   1      large         green pepper -- sliced into rings
   2      large         sweet red peppers -- sliced into rings
   1      quart         cider vinegar
   1      quart         bottled water (purified or spring)
     1/4  teaspoon      whole cloves

Drain pickle juice into large pan. Add cider, water, cloves and dill.  Bring liquid mixture to full boil; then reduce heat to simmer for 45 minutes to one hour (make sure you can open the windows, it's rather fragrant). 
Place eggs, vegetable slices and pickle spears into large glass or hard plastic container--a large ice cream pail works well.  Strain liquid mixture through a pasta colander and pour liquid over eggs and vegetables. 
Let sit for 24-36 hours at room temperature.  The eggs will be a very, very bright yellow and have a wonderful dill flavor the whole way through.  The vegetables and pickles will have a dill flavor never before experienced -- and can be eaten separately or used as a complimentary garnish.

Since you like Cajun food, here is a recipe that is basic with a Cajun meal. It's from Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside Place the Chicken fat, gizzards, Pork and bay leaves in a large skillet over high heat; cook until meat is thoroughly browned, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix, then add the Onions, Celery, bell Peppers and Garlic; stir thoroughly, scraping pan bottom well. Add the Butter and stir until melted. Reduce ht to medium and cook about 8 minutes, stirring constantly and scraping pan bottom well (if you're not using a heavy-bottomed skillet, the mixture will probably stick a lot). Add the stock and stir until any mixture sticking to the pan bottom comes loose; cook about 8 minutes over high heat, stirring once. Then stir in the Chicken livers and cook about 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir thoroughly; cover pan and turn heat to very low; cook five minutes. Remove from heat and leave covered until rice is tender, about 10 minutes. (The rice is finished this way so as not to overcook the livers and to preserve their delicate flavor.) Remove bay leaves and serve immediately.

Can't imagine anything better than Dirty Rice Dressing...an old Cajun recipe.  We fix it often with smoked chicken and pork when we are entertaining.  Absolutely delicious and something the locals for sure don't get everyday here in New Mexico.  Here goes the recipe:

Place giblets ( gizzards and livers) in 3 cups boiling water.  Boil until tender (about 20 minutes).  Remove giblets and save water as stock.  Separate and chop liver and gizzards.

Add one tablespoon of oil to skillet and brown ground pork and gizzards about six minutes.

Add seasoning, onions, celery, garlic and bell pepper.  Stir thoroughly.  Add a little butter, and simmer for about ten minutes.  Add the stock, and simmer for five minutes.  Add the rice, chicken livers, green onions, and parsley.  Stir and simmer five minutes.  Cover and reduce to a low heat level.  Cook until rice is fluffy (about 10 minutes or more).

Some people get turned off with giblets...don't let this fool you (esp.  the girls) in this recipe.  It is very good, and a treat to enjoy.  I love this stuff.

   2                    onions -- chopped

                        paprika

Good use for old Q:
Since I like to experiment/practice a lot, I tend to accumulate a refrigerator full of OLD Q every week or two (OLD Q, to me, is 4 to 7 days old.  Over a week, and I feed it to the dogs or toss it).  Being one who hates to waste Q, I developed a good use for it.  Here's what you do:

Get a pot with a capacity of 4-5 cups.  Fill it approx. 1/2 full of water, put on the stove to warm up on med.-low heat.  Get out your non-toxic old Q, chop it up into tiny pieces.  I like to use pork shoulder, chicken (pulled strands of breast meat from a whole one or finely chopped), and smoked sausage (not the store-bought junk.  Smoke it yourself.  Hot Italian sausage smokes up real good.  Slice it ~1/4 inch thick).  I never let ribs or turkey get old enough to use, so I can't say if they will go well or not.  Chop up 2 onions, a hot pepper, 2 or 3 garlic cloves, and small tomato.  Add a generous amount of fresh or frozen corn kernels.

Add enough of the above (in your own proportions) to fill the pot almost to the top.  Add spices below to suite your taste.  If you like beans, add some with a slice of bacon.  Bring to a HIGH SIMMER/ LOW boil.  Cook down until the liquid level just barely covers the rest of the ingredients (takes a long time).
After it has boiled down, add tomato paste/sauce to thicken (a good, thick RAGU sauce without mushrooms works OK).  Add a little vinegar (no more than 1/8 cup.  Just barely detectable).  Simmer/low-boil some more.  Periodically taste and adjust seasoning during this time.  You will note that grease collects on top.  I stir it back in, but it is healthier to skim most of it off.  It tastes better if you leave it.

Once you achieve the stew-like consistency you like best, eatitup!  It goes excellent with cornbread.

If you cook it down too much, you can add more vinegar and ketchup/tomato paste, simmer more (stirring frequently to prevent scorching), and you have yourself the makings of several DANDY sloppy-Joe style BBQ sandwiches.

Recipe By     : Dogzilla

Categories    : Bbq List                         Marinades

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          water
     1/2  cup           Worcestershire sauce
     1/4  cup           soy sauce
   1      large         pinch Hungarian paprika
   1      large         pinch garlic powder
   1      large         pinch onion powder
   3      medium        sprinkles black pepper
   3      medium        sprinkles thyme
   3      medium        sprinkles chili powder

I forget who, but someone, a while back, mentioned that Hungarian Paprika was (is) much better than the grocery store variety.  Well, I went to the local farmers' market, got some bona-fide Hungarian Paprika, and tried it out.  It is VERY GOOD.  I made some marinade for a pork shoulder using 2 cups water, 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and large "pinches" of the paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I also added a few medium sprinkles of black pepper, thyme, and chili powder.  I brought it to a boil before using it as marinade, and the aroma was fantastic.  The REAL paprika makes a big difference.  It also works good in rubs for chicken or pork chops.

Note:
I boiled the marinade again after putting the pork shoulder in the smoker and used it as a baste.  Worked out real good.

Add ingredients to sauce pan and bring to a boil - then simmer 10 minutes.

 For hamburgers: 3 lbs. ground beef, 4 crackers crumbled, 1/4 cup water to each lb. of beef.

Make into hamburger patties and brown quickly on both sides in a skillet, place in a baking pan, pour sauce over hamburgers and bake 350F for about 1 hour. 
If you use this for other meats just put your meat in a baking pan and pour sauce over meat and bake for an hour or an hour and a half, according to what kind of meat you are using.

                        ***Dr PEPPER MARINADE***
   1      cup           Dr Pepper
   1      cup           beer
   2      teaspoons     garlic powder
   1      teaspoon      cayenne
   2      tablespoons   angostura bitters
                        ***DTM'S NEXT DAY RUB***
   1      tablespoon    raw or brown sugar
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      tablespoon    med. grind white pepper
   1      tablespoon    pure ancho chili powder
   2      teaspoons     garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      onion powder
   1      tablespoon    fresh thyme
     1/2                lemon peel, dried for a 2-3 days
   1                    chipotle -- stemmed not seeded

Day 1: Mix up marinade ingredients. Cut a corner off the cryovac bag, stick in a funnel and pour in the marinade. Push out the air. Roll up the corner, duct tape and refrigerate overnight.

Dry rub. Pitch all ingredients in a blender or spice/coffee grinder. Turn on. While running shake the blender/grinder up and down.

Day 2: Early in the morning (I'm talking 6 am) pull the brisket from the cryovac package. Apply a really lot of the rub and pat and rub it in. Wrap brisket in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Day 3: Don't go to bed. About 1 am fire up the smoker. When fire and smoker are ready, remove brisket from refrigerator and put it on the smoker grill, and no, don't bring it to room temperature. Stabilize the temperature at 225F. Smoke cook for 8-14 hours or until about 2:30 p.m. When internal temperature gets to 170F run the cooker temperature up to 300F. Watch your water level now. Continue until internal hits 205F (higher if it is a really cheap piece of meat).

Pull the brisket off the grill and pour on some of Houndog's chipotle sauce. Wrap the brisket in plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and then wrap in a big beach towel. Put wrapped brisket in a cooler (no ice) or an oven that was heated to warm and then shut off.

About 4:30 p.m. serve some smoker appetizers and drinks. About 5:30 p.m. pull out the brisket, unwrap it and slice into 1/2" thick slices . Sauce or not.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   7      pounds        chicken
 112      ounces        canned whole tomatoes
  45      ounces        canned baby lima beans
   6      cups          frozen baby lima beans
   6      medium        potatoes
   2      large         yellow onions
  60      ounces        canned cream corn
   2      cups          sugar
   3      tablespoons   salt
   1      tablespoon    black pepper
   1      stick         butter or margarine
   1 1/2  ounces        Texas Pete hot sauce

Wash and cut chicken, if necessary. Place chicken in a large pot, barely cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 40 minutes. Remove chicken from pot and set aside to cool, reserving stock.

Open cans of whole tomatoes and place in a second large pot. Crush tomatoes with your hands. Open cans of baby lima beans and add liquid to the tomatoes. Put the canned baby limas into a mixing bowl and mash. Set mashed limas aside.

Add six cups chicken stock to the tomatoes. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook for about 40 minutes, or until liquid is reduced by about a third. Stir frequently.

While the liquid is cooking down, bone the chicken and shred chicken meat. Peel and finely dice the potatoes and onions. When tomato liquid is sufficiently reduced, add chicken, mashed limas, frozen baby limas, potatoes, and onions. Simmer mixture over low heat for about 3 1/2 hours, stirring frequently.

Add cream style corn, sugar, salt, pepper, butter or margarine, and Texas Pete. Continue cooking over low heat for an additional hour, stirring almost constantly until done.

                        ***See Directions***      

I would be happy to tell you the "real way" to fix your dried red chilies you bought from Safeway.

Boil them in water until soft, but not over done, or they will become bitter.

Next, take out the seeds if you don't want them to be too hot. Leave in the seeds if you want it hot. Remember, how hot the pepper is will depend on how hot your finished product is, and whether you want to leave the seeds in or not. Next, blend chile in blender, and make sure you use the same water you used to boil them in!  Makes a lot of difference in the flavor---very important. How much water you use will also have an effect on how hot or strong the chile will taste. Start with not to much water when you blend them, and if you think it is too hot, or strong, add a little more water until it taste the way you want it, and blend in. That's it!

                            Dry Cure For Fish

Recipe By     : The Smoked-Foods Cookbook ISBN 0-8117-0116-6
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Fish And Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           pickling salt
   1      cup           packed brown sugar
     3/4  teaspoon      pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      ground allspice
     1/2  teaspoon      ginger
     1/2  teaspoon      crumbled bay leaves
   2                    garlic cloves -- pressed

The brown sugar of this flavorful cure is especially good with salmon and steelhead, though it is also excellent with other fish. This recipe makes enough cure for approximately 10 pounds of fish. Use it for fillets, steaks, or whole small fish.

Combine the ingredients, and rub well into fish. Place in a non-metal container for several hours or overnight, depending on the size and amount of fish. Rinse fish well in cold water, rubbing slightly to release excess salt. Pat dry, then allow to air-dry for several hours until fish acquires a glaze.

Smoke according to your smoker's directions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
   3      tablespoons   chili powder
   2      teaspoons     cumin
   2      cloves        garlic minced
   2      pounds        steak sliced thinly

Combine ingredients and thoroughly mix together.  This is a dry marinade so there is no liquid.  Sprinkle the spice mixture on the meat slices and work into the grain with your fingers.  Cover and marinate overnight.  Place trays in the oven and dry at 145'F.  for first 4 hrs.  then set oven 130'F.  until dry.(4 to 8 hrs.) Jerky should be hard but not brittle.  Blot up any fat that appears with paper towels.  *For a chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain, or across the grain for more tender jerky.  That's all! It may take a few tries to figure out exactly how long to dry the meat, but you're still eating while you're trying so it's not that bad.  Well, good luck, I hope that you like it.  And, sorry this note is so long.

     1/2  cup           paprika
     1/4  cup           brown sugar
     1/8  cup           salt
     1/8  cup           garlic powder
     1/8  cup           dried chipotles peppers ground
   1      tablespoon    celery salt
   1      tablespoon    onion powder
   1      tablespoon    pepper -- black, fresh ground
   1      tablespoon    chimayo red chile -- ground

Mix thoroughly.  To me, the thing that makes this outstanding is the chipotles.  And note that these are not the canned ones in adobo - they're dried.  This makes their smokiness a bit more intense.  You might have difficulty finding them.  Look for them in the Hispanic section of larger grocery stores.  Same with the Red pepper, use cayenne instead.

                Brisket

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10      pounds        Brisket
   2      ounces        Salt
   2      ounces        Black pepper
   2      ounces        Paprika
   2      ounces        Garlic powder
   2      ounces        Accent
   2      ounces        Chili powder
     1/2  ounce         Red pepper

Buy a 10# brisket packer or untrimmed [lot of fat], the trimmed do not have the flavor as the fat boys.  Unwrap the brisket, wash it, and while it is still wet apply a rub:

Mix these up and you will have a powder rub.  If you are a spicy kind of guy apply the rub thick.  If you a bland mellow guy like me, then apply lightly.  After the rub is on, it will stick like glue due to the meat being wet, put brown sugar on as thick as possible.

Place the brisket on the smoker, fat side up, hold about 200F.  Smoking time depends on the unit you have the wood you are using and so on, but a good rule of thumb is 6 hours.

Once the meat is a dark color, cut into it to see if it has a ring like the brisket you buy in a restaurant, about 1/4" thick.  At this point you have all the smoke you need but the brisket is far from done.  Take it off the smoker, put it in the fridge, freezer, or go on to the next step.

About 6 to 8 hours prior to serving place the brisket in a deep pan, add about 1/3 cup of water, seal the pan with a lid or tinfoil, place in the oven on the top rack, set the temperature at 190 - 210.  Within about 5 or 6 hours this mouth watering aroma, driving the inhabitants into frenzy will consume the house.

If the meat is not tender to the point of almost cutting it with a fork, it did not cook long enough.  Prior to serving, trim off the fat, and you are now the genius that everyone will give advice on how to start a BBQ restaurant.  Oh, by the way, expect up to a 40% shrinkage, a 10# brisket raw might be a 6# cooked.

                Grilled

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    lamb or kid; 20-25 pounds
     1/4  cup           melted butter
     1/4  cup           olive oil
   2                    lemons
                        salt and pepper to taste

Easter in Greece is the biggest holiday of the year and damned near EVERYONE roasts a lamb or kid (goat that is, although I've been tempted). Every family has it's idea of the best way to cook the Easter meal but in general the animal is spitted and cooked over an open charcoal bed for about 6 hours. Constant turning of the 'souvla', Greek word for spit, is required so if the family is traditional and doesn't use an electric motor a lot of friends come in handy. I've found that the best way to obtain help in turning the lamb is to have LOTS of beer and Greek wine on hand. The 'souvla' is about 8-9 feet long with a handle for turning on one end. It's placed on a pair of spikes driven into the ground about 7 feet apart. The spikes have several different 'U's welded to them for raising and lowering the spit. If you try this recipe, start a charcoal bed about 6'x2' before preparing the lamb or kid and have a separate charcoal fire going to add to the bed later on. By the time you get the animal prepared the fire should be just about right. You'll probably need 20 pounds, or more, of charcoal to complete the cooking. Have more than you need on hand.

Wipe lamb inside and out with a damp cloth. Rub cavity and outside of lamb with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Cut a small opening in the shoulder and hip joints and pour a small amount of salt and pepper into them. Run the spit through the anus and out of the top of the skull. A hammer may be needed for this. Use baling wire to secure the spine to the spit in two or three places. Sew up the cavity with white string. Push foreshanks back towards body and tie in position. Wire the back legs to the spit. This will prevent them splaying out.

Rub outside again with lemon juice, salt and pepper and place on a rack set in a large catering-size baking dish.

Combine melted butter with olive oil and brush half of this over the lamb or kid. Baste with the remainder at times during cooking. Place the spit over the fire with the lamb or kid approximately 18" over the fire. Adjust the height according to the heat of the fire during cooking. Turn the spit constantly for 6-8 hours, lubricating the person turning liberally with wine or beer, then enjoy your Greek Easter Feast.

The innards aren't wasted. They're used to make a dish called 'Kokoretsi' also cooked over a charcoal bed on a small souvla, but that's another story and this is too long all ready. Have a Happy Easter!

                        ***PORK***
   6      pounds        pork picnic shoulder roast or Boston butt -- (up to 10)

Mix rub ingredients together and store in a tightly sealed jar.  Recipe makes enough for about 3 roasts.

Rub spice mixture on the meat the night before smoking.  Place meat in Ziploc freezer bag and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.

Remove the meat 1 hour before going into smoker and let it come to room temperature.

Mix sauce ingredients well and bring to boil and then simmer for 2 hours.

Prepare smoker and pace meat on grill of smoker.  Smoke pork at 220-240F for about 1 1/2 hours per pound.  Mop every hour with sauce.  Turn roast over every 2 hours or so.

Here is when Danny Gaulden takes out his pork shoulders:

For a tender, easy to slice roast- out of pit at 180F internal For a tender, easy to slice, pullable roast- out of pit at 185F For a tender, easy to pull roast- out of pit at 190F

Remove roast from smoker and let stand for 15 minutes.  Slice or pull off meat in strips and separate from fat.

For pulled-pork sandwiches, chop the meat.  Spoon some of the sauce onto a fresh split bun/roll.  Heap on meat and spoon on more sauce over meat.

Serve with coleslaw on the sandwich or on the side.

   1      tablespoon    red pepper flakes
   2      tablespoons   firmly packed brown sugar

Preparation: Combine all ingredients and let stand several hours before using.

Since I am in the experiment mode, I added 1/2 pint water, 1 tsp. celery seed, and a dollop (maybe 1 Tbs.) molasses. In deference to former list member and keeper of the recipes, Tom Solomon, I also added 1 tsp. nuc nam to half of this. The Nuc nam actually made a pleasant addition, rounding out the flavors nicely.

I will keep enough in the refrigerator to last for about two weeks and freeze the rest.

   1      large         turkey, 15-20 pounds
                        oak and apple wood for smoking
  12      ounces        apple cider vinegar
   1      tablespoon    red pepper flakes
   2      cups          water
   1      cup           garlic -- finely minced
   2      sprigs        fresh rosemary -- finely chopped
   2      sprigs        fresh thyme -- finely chopped
   2      sprigs        fresh sage -- finely chopped
   2      tablespoons   brown mustard seeds -- crushed
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   4      tablespoons   nuoc nam

In a water smoker or smoker with an offset firebox, smoke turkey for 5 to 6 hours at 225F, using a 50/50 mixture of oak and apple wood. Place a drip pan under the turkey--use the drippings as a basis for stuffing or for an excellent turkey gravy. Remove turkey from smoker and place in a large Dutch oven.

Combine apple cider vinegar and red pepper flakes and add to Dutch oven, pouring over turkey. Add two cups water. Mix remaining ingredients thoroughly and stuff cavity of turkey (you can do this before beginning to smoke as well if you choose). Reserve some of the "stuffing" mixture to spread evenly along the outside of the turkey as well. Cover, place in the range oven, and bake at 325F for an additional 2 hours or so, or until the internal temperature of the turkey at it's thickest point reaches 190F. If you wish a crisp skin remove the cover from the Dutch oven about a half hour before the turkey is done. Remove from heat, strain and reserve the pan drippings for stuffing or gravy, and serve.

Okay, here's my Easy Blackberry Ice Cream (very popular in the Pacific NW since blackberries are everywhere). No eggs, and no cooking. Sorry, not non-fat because there is cream.

Puree the blackberries in processor or blender. Strain to remove seeds. Mix all ingredients, pour into ice cream maker, and process according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to separate container and freeze for about 2 hours before serving.

At room temperature rub down a slab of pork spare ribs with a thick mixture of 3/4 garlic salt, 1/4 sage and 1 Tbs. black pepper. Let 'em set at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Then rub again with above mix and let stand for 30 minutes.

Place spare ribs on smoker, 190F, with meat side up for 1 hour then turn over for 1 hour.  Give the ribs heavy white smoke. Take off smoker and seal in foil then place in oven. Turn oven on to bake and 300F. When oven reaches 300F turn temperature down to 200F for 2 1/2 hours. Do not open oven door during this time. Ribs are fallin' off the bone at this point, you could eat'em with no BBQ sauce. 
Take ribs out of foil and return to smoker with the meat side down and spread with BBQ sauce, wait till BBQ sauce is sticky.

Turn over and spread on more BBQ sauce.

   1      dried         habanero chile, chopped fine OR
   2      tablespoons   hot pepper sauce

Although this is not REAL BBQ it is an easy way to cook a whole chicken on a gas grill!

And you thought gas grills were for those fat, white legged guys you see in the neighborhood every Sunday burning steak. This recipe is so simple that I always wonder why those "Famous" TV cooks have not demonstrated it.

I call it Easy Roasted Chicken.

Split a whole 3 pound chicken by cutting up the middle of the breast bone.  Press the chicken flat, and rub both sides, plus under the skin around the breast, with the following concoction:

Mix the spices thoroughly in a bowl. Store remainder in a covered jar in a cool pantry.

Light both sides of your gas grill and leave them on high for ten minutes or until the lava rocks are hot. Shut off one side of the grill and turn the other side to its lowest setting. Place the chicken, skin side up, on the off side of the grill. Close the cover and let it cook for 45 minutes. Raise the cover and turn the chicken 90F, close the cover and finish cooking for another 45 minutes. Test the thigh for doneness with an instant reading meat thermometer. About 180F is okay or pull the wing, it should come off easily. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for at least ten minutes before slicing.

                        ***See Directions***      

Over here they call it Ahi (yellow fin tuna). I suggest just grilling a couple filets about 8 to 10 oz. each. The meat is like steak. Make up a sauce of about 1/4 cup Oyster sauce 1/4 cup shoyu 1 tsp. sugar or 1 tbs. honey heat to blend don't boil. Baste it on the filets as they cook and use the balance as a topping sauce when done. You might also try to slice a little of it to pieces the size of poker chips. 1/4 inch thick and eat it raw on a little shredded cabbage with a dipping sauce of Chinese powdered mustard mixed with shoyu sauce. This is "sashimi", an excellent appetizer. Did you buy it or catch it. For grilling the fresher out of the ocean the better. With sashimi it is usually better to refrigerate overnight to firm up the flesh. If you caught it how big was it? About 18 years ago I helped bring in a 188 lb. Ahi in a 16 ft outboard. Had to stretch him across the stern from gunwale to gunwale and sit on him to hold him down until we got back in. Got him about 2/3 miles NW of Pearl Harbor. Ate it every way possible for 2 weeks. Opps, just remembered, also excellent baked in a dish with milk and butter and lay a strip of bacon on top add a little lemon pepper and dive in.

   1      pound         navy beans
   1      medium        onion -- chopped
     1/4  pound         salt pork -- chopped

                        black pepper

Soak the beans overnight in water. Drain.
 In a bean pot, put about a third of the beans.  Add about a third of the onion and salt pork.  Repeat for the second third and again for the last. Add the remaining ingredients.
 Add water to the mix until it just covers the beans.

Heat oven to 300F and cook the beans covered for five hours.  Stir.  Cook another hour uncovered.  If they are too hard, continue to cook.  If the beans are too dry, add a little water and stir.  They should remain moist.

                        bourbon
                        crushed ice

Start with good clean water.  Our tap water from the town is like scooping from an old aquarium, so, I filter for sediment, then a charcoal filter for taste.  Only then is it fit for good bourbon. The mint is fresh picked.  More than a half hour it looses is flavor and fine scent.

Get a mug capable of holding 16 oz.  That is 16 ounces from the good old U S of A.  No metrics here.

A teaspoon of sugar, 4 medium or 5 small mint leaves, a tablespoon of water in the mug and mix.  Fill with crushed ice.

Now pour on good bourbon.  I use Wild Turkey 101, but some others will do. Stir to mix in the mint flavor and frost the mug.   Sip and watch the thermometer on the smoker.

It is a good idea to keep a small ice bucket handy if you have to add more on a hot day.  If not, I'd have to get up and go in the kitchen from the deck and get some.  The fridge is all the way on the other side of the room.  Long walk.  Or just yell "Honey, I need some ice" and the wife will bring it.

Last cornbread my wife made was so bad the birds would not touch it and a passing skunk would not waste a shot on it. She does make a good potato salad.  No written recipe so I'll wing it. 
Boil about 3 lb. of potatoes with the skins on.

Boil 3 eggs with them, but not as long.  Peel potatoes while just a little warm and cut into bite sized chunks.  Chop an onion and a little bell pepper into it.  Slice the eggs into it. Mayonnaise to coat everything well. Salt and pepper to taste.

Not fancy, not exotic ingredients, but it  has been my favorite for many years.

Soak the chips in water for a couple of hours, and then drain.  Place the chips in the tray.  Season the entire brisket with Rustic Rub.  Place the brisket in the smoker and smoke at 350F for 4 hours.  Reduce the heat to 125F and continue to smoke for 8 hours.  Place a drip pan underneath the brisket to catch some of the drippings to use for the BBQ sauce.  Remove the brisket from the smoker.  With a sharp knife, trim off the outer thin black skin.  Divide the brisket in two pieces and trim off all the fat.  Slice the brisket very thin and serve with the BBQ sauce.

In a saucepan, whisk all the ingredients together.  Season the sauce with salt and black pepper.  Place the pan over medium heat, bring the mixture up to a simmer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  Sauce will keep for 2 weeks, covered and refrigerated.

   1                    skirt steak (about 2 1/2 pounds)
   1      cup           Coca-Cola
   2      teaspoons     mesquite smoke seasoning
   2      teaspoons     fajita seasoning
                        flour tortillas

Trim steak of excess fat and membrane.  Marinate steak in Coke, mesquite seasoning and fajita seasoning for 3 to 4 hours or overnight.

Grill over high heat to desired doneness.  Slice thinly across the grain and serve on flour tortillas with guacamole and pico de gallo.

NOTES : These fajitas are a little different than those found in the typical
Mexican restaurant franchise.  Instead of meaning anything pan-fried with
peppers, onions and tomatoes, it refers to the true meaning of fajita.
The meat is grilled and served on flour tortillas with guacamole and
pico de gallo.

I've made this recipe several times.  I like the results.  In fact,
I think I'll head straight for the store and get some skirt steak.

                     Fancy Packed Smoked To Eat Fish

Recipe By     : Dan Sawyer
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Fish And Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

IMO Fresh Chinook or King salmon are the best and Coho or Silver salmon run a weak second for a sweet buttery flavor. Scale, remove the head, fins and cheeks. Filet the fish, removing the backbone and rib bones. Leave the skin on.

Lay the filets out and dry salt-Use a kiln dried medium or medium fine salt and apply the salt just a little heavier than you would salt to eat. It will look like fresh fallen snow - not completely white all over - the
belly and thinner tail areas will have less salt than the thicker  mid-body areas. I don't brine in a solution because it is difficult to predict the amount of salt in the thin areas. To put a whole filet into a brine and have it come out with even salt is difficult if not impossible. Dry salting allows for proportionate distribution according to thickness, and I believe it is much more accurate. Too little salt will not hurt anything, if it is fresh fish to begin with and it is kept cool before smoking, I wouldn't worry about it - kippered salmon is smoked without any salt at all.

Stack the filets on top of each other in a container that will permit drainage, cover with plastic or a lid and let it sit in the refer for about a day (if you butcher and salt early in the morn, it will be ready to smoke the next morning).  Before smoking, gently rinse the filet and squeegee the excess  from the surface with your hand. The surface of the filet should be allowed to dry - I do this in the smokehouse as I am getting the fire started, I leave the doors open just a crack for a couple of hours to let out the excess moisture.

After the surface becomes somewhat dry to the touch, close the doors and slowly bring up the temp to about 100F.  I'll try to maintain this temp for about 4-5 hours and then slowly bring the temp up another 20F. For the next 3-4 hours try to hold at about 120-130F or so. For the last couple of hours I'll bring the temp up another 20F so that the internal temp will be 140-150F for the last 30 min. and take the fish out and let it cool.

This process isn't really a cold smoke or a hot smoke, it's sort of in
between.  The filets are cured with salt and then smoked. I've been smoking salmon this way for many years and have never had any problems with spoilage or sickness.  The USDA says that the internal temp should reach a minimum of 180F for thirty minutes for salmon, but there is no viable reference as to the salt content.  I have tried to smoke at 180F for thirty min and the results aren't nearly as moist. I think that 150F is stretching it.  In the last hour or so of the process, 40F makes a hell of a difference in the finished product.  Just a note, during the smoke cycle the thin areas will be done and drier before the thicker parts - I will cut the filets into three pieces across, put the tail sections on their own tray so I can move them around and take them out when they are done. 
If I'm smoking for myself I usually cut the entire filet crossways into 2" strips and load the trays with a fingerspace between the strips.  The pieces are just about right for snacking or handing out without having to tear into a larger piece. Smaller pieces seem to smoke up a lot better than a whole filet. I've always just used salt and no other seasonings, but I think white pepper as Charles recommends, would be pretty tasty. A lot of ways to smoke salmon - finding the one you like the best is the fun part.

The main thing is at least 50% oil! Also, I feel that you need to add extra KICK if you want it spicier because the oil seems to block some penetration of the spice. Also, I strongly believe that to get better smoke penetration (i.e. start with lower heat and build up) is a necessity if you want a strong smoke flavor. The oil seems to also block smoke penetration. I have had great success with oil and the start low method. But then, I like to belch on Wed. and blow smoke rings from Q on Sat.!!!

Make a roux in a heavy bottomed pot from the flour and oil.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until roux is a dark caramel color.  Be careful not to burn.  If you see black specks in the roux, throw it out and start over.

Add stock gradually to roux, stirring as it is added to prevent lumps from forming.

Add remaining ingredients except the shrimp, hot sauce, and rice.

Boil the shells, tails and heads of the shrimp in about 1 or two cups water, depending on how many shells you have.  Add to gumbo during the cooking phase.

Simmer for an hour or two or until the meat is cooked and the gumbo starts to thicken.  Add the shrimp and hot sauce about 20 minutes  before serving.

Serve in a bowl over rice.  Sprinkle some file into the individual servings.

'File' is pronounced Fe Lay

                        Filet Of Beef and Oysters

Recipe By     : Kip Jones
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Beef

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4                    filet mignon steaks
   2      tablespoons   butter or olive oil
   1      quart         oysters, reserve liquid -- shucked
     2/3  cup           white wine to deglaze
   2                    garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
   1                    juiced lemon
   1      tablespoon    chopped parsley
                        salt and pepper to taste

Pan fry the filets in the butter or olive oil until rare or medium rare over medium to med. high heat. For me, about two minutes per side is fine. Use a non-stick pan. Remove the filets to a serving plate, reserving the pan drippings in the frying pan. 
deglaze the pan with the white wine. Add the thinly sliced garlic and the lemon juice. Add the oysters and the oyster liquid and simmer for approx. 6 - 8 minutes until the oysters are just cooked; until the edges of the oysters are just beginning to curl. Do not over-cook!

Carefully remove, with a slotted spoon, the oysters and arrange around and over the filet, reserving the liquid in the pan.

Put the remaining liquid back on the stove-top, over med/high heat and reduce to half. The sauce will slightly thicken. At the last minute add the chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Be very careful with the salt as the oysters and liquid have a salty flavor.

Pour the sauce over the filets and oysters, garnish with parsley and serve. Sounds weird but WOW!!! it's good.

NOTES : I saw this one on Jeff Smith's TV program, "The Frugal Gourmet" about a year ago. As the program ended I realized that I had to try this recipe so I jotted it down on paper as best as I could remember it and then transferred it to "Mangia" on my Mac. I have fixed the dish many times now, made a few adjustments and I believe it's about perfect for posting.

Recipe By     : Marius Johnston
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2  pounds        boneless chicken thigh
     1/2  cup           white vinegar
     1/2  cup           onion -- chopped
   5      tablespoons   soy sauce
   1      teaspoon      black peppercorns -- coarsely crushed
   4                    bay leaves
   2 1/2  tablespoons   sugar
   1      cup           water

     1/2  cup           fresh mushrooms -- sliced
                        salt to taste

1. Rinse chicken under cold water and pat dry. Cut into 1/2 inch thick  pieces. Place aside in a thick pot.

2. Make a marinade of vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, peppercorns,  bay leaf, and 1/4 cup of the water and add this to the chicken in the pot. Let sit for about 1/2 hour stirring occasionally.

3. Meanwhile, saut� the onions in about 1 Tbsp. of oil until translucent and fragrant then put aside.

4. Bring the pot of chicken and marinade to a boil and lower the heat. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes then add the mushrooms and remaining water.

5. Once again bring to a boil and season with salt if necessary.

6. Garnish with cilantro and serve with hot rice and a side dish of Bagoong Vegetables.

NOTES : Adobo is considered as the Philippines national dish. As the name suggested, this is one of the many Spanish-inspired inclusions in the Filipino cuisine. There are many variations to the technique and ingredients employed in the preparation of this dish but the common ground to all is the subtle sourness of vinegar and the aroma of garlic and bay leaf. Pork or tofu may be used in place of chicken.

                    Fire Roasted Tomato Chipotle Salsa

Recipe By     :

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      tablespoon    virgin olive oil
     1/2                onion -- (chopped)
   1      pound         blackened Roma tomatoes
   4      teaspoons     finely minced roasted garlic
     1/2  cup           minced fresh cilantro leaves
   4                    chopped chipotle chilies en adobo
   1      pound         Roma tomatoes
     1/4  cup           virgin olive oil
     1/4  cup           red wine vinegar
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      teaspoon      sugar

To prepare Fire Roasted Tomato Chipotle Salsa, in saut� pan over medium heat, place 1 tablespoon virgin olive oil.  Add 1/2 onion (chopped) and saut� until caramelized, about 10 minutes.  In food processor or blender, place onion, 1 pound blackened Roma tomatoes, and 4 teaspoons finely minced roasted garlic.

Pulse until finely chopped but not pureed.

Add 1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves and 4 chopped chipotle chilies en adobo, pulse to mix.

Peel, seed and chop 1 pound Roma tomatoes and add to mixture with 1/4 cup virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon sugar.

Obviously this recipe intrigues, what with the chipotle ingredient.  I also can substitute a tablespoon of Balsamic Vinegar for some of the red wine vinegar.  I can use fresh parsley if the IGA doesn't have fresh cilantro.  We have available some cylindrical tomatoes about 1.5 in.  D by 3.5 in.  L, and I will call those Roma.  My question is, how do you blacken a tomato?  I could put 'em in the kitchen oven broiler I reckon.  Spray with oil? Burn 'em till they blister? What is the point, surely this has to make some fundamental change to 'em that must be desirable.  I guess I could also roast the garlic at the same time.

This powder is somewhat more pungent and fresher tasting than a packaged brand, so use a bit less.

Mix all ingredients. and distribute between the 5 pieces of foil. Fold into 5"X 2" packets and poke a couple of small holes in the top. Place 1 packet on top of coals and in a few minutes a fragrant smoke will emerge. Change the packets every 15 minutes.

This particular recipe was made to simulate the flavor of Schezhuan smoked duck, but with chicken wings. While I wasn't necessarily wowed over by this recipe, It sure started the wheels a spinnin'. Just think of some of the flavoring possibilities, especially with some of the lighter types of meat like chicken, fish, maybe pork.

   3      pounds        country ribs or other

   2      tablespoons   black pepper fine ground
   2      tablespoons   salt
                        ---------SAUCE FOR RE-HEATING------
   1      small         bottle Open Pit Sauce
   1      small         bottle A-1 Sauce
     1/4  cup           molasses
   1      supply        hickory chips

Regular old supermarket pork.  Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other pork. Not too much fat.  Cut off any gross excess fat and cut them to even thickness.  You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly.  You may compensate by scoring the meat.  In a large baking pan, soak the ribs with cider vinegar, after which sprinkle them with garlic salt and finely ground black pepper. (Don't use pepper mills, or other peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how long the ribs soak, or how much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits all sides, you don't have to puncture them.  This sweetens the meat. 
The key to the fire is the hickory chips.  Keep feeding these amazing little fellows to the charcoal.  The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do without them.  Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole dinner and ruin it.

Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches or more from the meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness.  As the meat cooks turn it often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with anything.  Don't cover the grill and don't stray too far -- fire is always hiding in the wings.  Here is the catch -- the trick -- the hard part, is the timing.  You may ruin some meals before you hit it, but the time to take them off the grill is one minute after trichina danger is past.  As soon as the meat turns brown it's time to eat.  You can use the small strips you cut off to judge just when things are perfect.

Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's awful) 1 bottle Open Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 cup of molasses. Start re-heating the sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the fridge.  alt.  without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325F oven for 15-20 minutes.  Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it will have pork fat in it now.

NOTE: If using this sauce for chicken, lemons are better than limes; limes  give a pleasant tang to pork and other meats.

Allow to rest 20 min. While comal is heating, roll out dough balls between pieces of wax paper dough to thin disk. Or pat between floured hands until thin disk forms. Or purchase an electric tortilla press that presses the dough and cooks the tortilla at the same time (I now use the electric press). Place flattened dough onto hot comal flip and presto best tasting tortilla ever. Does not fall apart.

   1      cup           yellow cornmeal
     1/2  teaspoon      soda
   2      teaspoons     baking powder
   2      teaspoons     sugar
   2      teaspoons     salt

Whisk above ingredients together in mixing bowl, make "well" in center, set aside.

In separate bowl, beat the hell out of 1 large egg or 2 small eggs with electric hand held mixer, eggs at room temperature is best but cold eggs will work.

Add to beaten eggs exactly one cup of cultured buttermilk and 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, stir together.

If you placed your oiled, cured 10" skillet in the 425F oven before you started mixing the two bowls above, it should be hot by now, it must be hot.

Pour the "wet" bowl contents into the "dry" bowl and stir to mix, don't over mix. You have about 30 seconds to set the skillet out of the oven and pour the batter into the skillet, going in a circular motion around the skillet in a ever increasing smaller circle.  You can not rake the batter around in the skillet after it hits the hot surface.  You can rake the last remnants of batter from the bowl however.

Put the skillet back in the oven.  Set your timer or look at the clock, it will take only eleven minutes until the bread is done if your oven thermostat is accurate.

Turn out bread onto raised bread rack as soon as you take it from oven or it will "sweat" if your skillet was "cured" and not used for anything else, the bread will slide right out. The above sounds like a lot of fuss but it is not, and you will have cornbread so good it might make you slap your mamma.  She might slap back Floyd Flud.

                        Food Processor Hushpuppies

Recipe By     : Bruce Yates
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Hushpuppies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      small         onion
   1 1/2  cups          yellow cornmeal
     1/2  cup           all-purpose flour
   2      teaspoons     baking powder
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   1                    egg
     3/4  cup           milk
                        fat for frying

Peel Onion and cut into 3 or 4 pieces. Lock bowl in position. Insert steel blade. Put in onion and process until finely chopped. Remove steel blade and insert plastic blade. To onion add cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, egg, and milk. Process just until all ingredients are blended. Heat about 2 inches of fat or oil in a skillet until hot. Drop tablespoons of batter in hot fat and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 4 to 5 minutes.

Serve at once with butter. 
Yield: About 20

Note from me: The skillet works fine, but a deep fat fryer works even better.

This is the only hushpuppy my wife has cooked for the last 20 years and I am not about to ask her to change it. I have not found a catfish restaurant in East Texas that has a hushpuppy that can match the taste of this one.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

   2      tablespoons   ancho or pasilla chile -- ground
   1      tablespoon    dried oregano
   1      teaspoon      ground cumin

   1      tablespoon    white or rice vinegar
   2      tablespoons   tequila
   1      pound         ground pork

Chorizo is a Mexican sausage that can be used in many ways, chief among them in breakfast tacos combined with skillet fried potatoes and/or scrambled eggs.  There are many variations - this is my favorite.  You can make it in bulk as it freezes well.  Cook as you would ground beef but on lower heat to avoid burning the spices.

Combine herbs and spices, tequila and vinegar.  Add to pork and mix well.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3                    boxes alum powder
   3      gallons       cucumbers, cured
     1/2  gallon        white vinegar
   7      pounds        sugar
     1/2  gallon        cider vinegar
     1/2  cup           tarragon vinegar
   6                    boxes pickling spices
   6      cloves        garlic
   6      teaspoons     black pepper

Curing cucumbers: Into large glass jars or pickling crocks, slice small, young, near seedless cucumbers (or you can leave whole for whole pickles) forming layers about 2 inches thick. Add a layer of pickling salt (or NON-iodized table salt) to cover cucumbers. Continue alternate layers of cucumbers and salt until jar is a little over 3/4 full (to leave working room). Always end up with layer of salt on top. The process of adding cucumbers can continue for months as necessary to fill the jars if your cucumber supply is small. Let stand, stirring every week or two until cucumbers have become translucent (at least 8 weeks, usually longer). I've seen cured cucumbers over 2 years old in crocks make excellent pickles.

Preparing pickles: Drain and thoroughly rinse cured cucumbers. Cover in cold water, change to fresh water twice a day for 2 days and nights. Boil 1/2 gallon water, 1/2 gallon white vinegar and 3 boxes alum (you can use 4 to 6 boxes alum for crispier pickles) (lumps about the size of an egg if bulk is used) and pour over drained cucumbers while still BOILING hot. Let this stand for 2 days and nights and pour off. Make sure cucumbers are real firm at this stage. If not, leave in alum water for another night or two.

Fill small cloth sacks or cleaned nylon stockings cut in 6 inch lengths and tied at one end to form a sack each with 1 can pickling spice, 1 clove garlic, and 1 tsp. black pepper. Tie loose end of stockings or sacks to form balls of spice.

Boil 7 lbs. sugar (2 1/4 cups sugar make a pound), 1/2 gallon cider vinegar, and all spice bags and pour over drained cucumbers hot. Make sure spice bags are evenly spaced throughout cucumbers. If gallon jars are used, place at least 2 spice bags per jar. Let this get cold and add tarragon vinegar. (Divide amount evenly between jars if required). Let stand one week. Remove pickles (SAVING JUICE) and pack in jars, DISCARD spice sacks. Bring the saved pickle juice to a boil and pour over pickles and seal jars. You may want to have extra vinegar, and sugar on hand to make up additional juice if needed. You can throw the spice bags into the vinegar/sugar and boil it to make extra juice. You will have to season the juice by taste, but make sure you use enough sugar to give it the consistency of a very thin syrup.

Variations: Leave out garlic if desired or add jalapenos to spices for hot pickles.

Other uses: The pickle juice from jars of eaten pickles makes excellent seasoning for many other dishes, including barbeque sauces, spaghetti sauces, sloppy Jose, enchiladas, tuna, chicken, or turkey salads or anything favoring a sweet/sour seasoning.

Here's the recipe for the Pickle Juice BBQ Sauce and also the recipe for the sweet pickles from which you MUST obtain the juice. No other pickle juice will do. Anyone making this sauce will have to make the pickles and eat them first so you will have the leftover juice.

Actually, if you don't want to make the pickles, you can just make the juice by making a couple of the little sacks of spices mentioned in the recipe and simmering with cider vinegar and sugar for an hour or so. Just pour in a pint or quart of vinegar, heat, throw in the spice bags, and add sugar until you have a very very thin syrup, aka pickle juice.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      cups          scraped corn -- see below
   4      slices        bacon -- diced
   1      cup           half and half
   2      tablespoons   butter
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

For this dish you should use either green field corn (the best choice) or very mature fresh golden bantam. If the former, open the husk of the corn and cut into a kernel to ascertain whether or not it is milky. It should be. (Sweet corn -- golden bantam, etc. -- is always green when sold, hence always milky.) Remove husks from about 1 dozen ears. Strip off the silk. With a sharp knife, slice the kernels into a bowl. With the dull side of the knife blade, scrape down the cob to get all remaining milk and pulp. Do not scrape off the clinging tough husks if you can avoid it. Measure out 4 cups milk, pulp and kernels. Set aside.

In a heavy 10-inch iron skillet fry the bacon over moderate heat until crisp. Skim out bacon and reserve. Add the 4 cups measured corn to the drippings in the skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fry over low heat, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes. Add the half-and-half; press the corn down gently to level it with a spatula. Dot with butter. Cover and cook over lowest heat until corn is tender and the liquid has cooked away. Taste for seasoning. Turn out on a heated platter.

Sprinkle with reserved bacon and serve immediately.

                        lard (render your own)
   2      dozen         squash blossoms w/2 inches stem
   1                    egg yolk

   1      cup           unbleached all purpose flour
                        salt to taste

Heat 2" lard in Dutch oven or deep skillet to 365. Preheat oven to 200. Wash blossoms free of dirt and bugs. Pat dry. In a wide bowl, mix egg yolk well into ice water using a wooden spoon. Then dump flour in all at once, stirring quickly. The batter will be lumpy. Holding blossoms by the stem, drag them through the batter and drop into the hot fat, frying each one about 30 seconds on one side, flipping to the other for 10-20 seconds, until it browns. Remove each blossom and place on a wire rack on a sheet pan and keep warm in the oven until all are fried. Salt lightly and serve immediately.

This is tempura batter and other vegetables and shrimp can be done at the same time.

   1      can           chicken broth
   2      tablespoons   garlic juice
   1      tablespoon    salt
   4      tablespoons   Louisiana Hot Sauce
   1      tablespoon    cayenne pepper
   3      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce

Mix all ingredients and let dissolve to blend.

Inject your turkey at least 24 hours before cooking.   Use about 2/3 of this batch for the first injection.  30 minutes before dropping'  the bird in the hot grease inject the remaining 1/3 of this batch.

We fry turkeys at 350F in Peanut oil (use to use vegetable oil.) An 11 to 15 pound turkey will take at least 45 minutes.  You will need to use your own techniques for deciding when the turkey is done.

Playing around a couple weeks ago:
We injected a turkey and then smoked it at 150F for five hours, then re-injected and dropped it in the hot grease.  It was very good for a combo smoked-fried turkey.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          pinto beans
   6      cups          water -- or more as needed
  12      ounces        beer
   2      teaspoons     bacon drippings -- or peanut oil
   1      large         onion -- chopped

   2                    fresh jalapenos or serranos -- chopped
   2                    pickled jalapenos -- chopped
   1      teaspoon      chili powder
   1      teaspoon      salt

These drunken beans make a great side or supper dish, and also work well for refritos.  Plan on a total cooking time of about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  The hardness of the water, the altitude, and the obstinacy of the particular beans can all affect the timing.

Pick through the beans and rinse them, watching for any gravel or grit.  Soak the beans in water, enough to cover them by several inches, preferably overnight.

Drain the beans, and add them to a stockpot or a large, heavy saucepan.  Cover them with the water and beer.  Simmer the beans, uncovered, over low heat.

After 1 hour, stir the beans up from the bottom and check the liquid level.  If there is not at least an inch more water than beans, add enough hot water to bring it to that level.  Simmer the beans another 30 minutes, then check them again, adding water as needed.

When the beans are well softened, add the remaining ingredients, and continue simmering.  Cook at least 15 more minutes, keeping the level of the water just above the beans.  The beans are done when they are soft and creamy but not mushy, with each bean retaining its shape.  There should be extra liquid at the completion of the cooking time, although the beans should not be soupy.  If you want the liquid a little thicker, squash a few of the beans in the bottom of the pot with a potato or bean masher.

Serve the beans immediately, or cover them and keep them warm for as long as 1 hour.  Or let them cool, and refrigerate or freeze them for later use.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***

What follows is more a method than a recipe...

Wash 2 - 3 cups of pinto or pink beans in a strainer. Check for and remove any dirt clods, stones and shriveled or otherwise bad-looking beans. Put beans in a pot or other suitable container and cover with a couple inches of cold water. Let beans soak overnight or at least 8 hours. Drain and rinse beans and put in an ovenproof container. I use a cast iron pot. A ceramic bean pot would be ideal, but I don't have one big enough. An oven-proof glass casserole or stainless steel pot can also be used.

Saut� some chopped onions and chopped fresh chilies in peanut or corn oil. I use a combination of mild Anaheims and/or poblanos, jalapenos and/or serranos for a bit of heat, and ripe Fresnos or other ripe red chilies, if available, for a bit of color. Stir the saut�ed onions and chilies into the beans. Cover beans with an inch or two of broth. I use the smoky flavored broth I make and freeze from leftover smoked turkey or chicken if I have some available...regular chicken or turkey broth if not. De-stem and remove the seeds from a half dozen or so whole small dried chilies such as Fresno, puya or jalapeno...or 2 - 3 larger chilies such California, New Mexico and ancho. Sometimes I throw in a couple of chipotles as well for their nice smoky flavor and heat.

Stir in some ground cumin and crushed Mexican oregano (about half a teaspoon or to taste). Push a couple of sprigs of fresh epazote into the beans. Cover the pot and bake in an oven at 225 to 250F until beans are cooked through, usually 7 to 8 hours. After a couple of hours, check to make sure there's liquid covering the beans. Add liquid as necessary (broth or water is fine, but my homemade pumpkin ale works even better) to make sure the beans are still cooking in some broth. Remove the cover for the last hour or so and continue to add a little liquid if necessary to make sure there's some broth left at the end of cooking.

When the beans are done, fish out the epazote and dried chilies. Discard the epazote and put the chilies in a blender, add some of the bean broth and thoroughly puree. Add the broth/chile puree back to the bean pot and stir in. Season to taste with salt and ground black pepper if desired.

Serve with shredded jack or cheddar cheese, chopped onion, sliced pickled jalapenos, salsa, hot sauce (or whatever else might suit your fancy) on the side to add per individual discretion. Enjoy...

Fry bread is served with chili, beans, BBQ meats, and stews as well as honey, etc.  throughout Arizona...  here is one recipe:

Mix all ingredients well--dough should be soft, but not sticky.  Knead dough until smooth.  Divide into 12 equal portions.  In deep skillet heat 1 inch of lard or oil until a small piece of dough dropped into it sizzles.  With floured hands stretch and pat each piece of dough until thin.  Fry one at a time in hot oil for about 4 minutes, turning once, until browned and puffed on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.  Best served warm.  ENJOY!

   4      heads         green cabbage

   1      head          garlic
   1      bunch         celery
   4      pounds        Kirby cucumbers
  15      tablespoons   salt
  10      liters        hot water
   2      tablespoons   mustard seeds
   2      tablespoons   peppercorns
   4                    bay leaves

These are the approximate ingredients you would need to fill up a 10 liter barrel. Peel garlic and cut each clove in half. Peel carrots. Wash vegetables. Cut cabbage, carrots and celery into quarters. Break apart cauliflower. Leave cucumbers or tomatoes whole.  With cabbage, discard outer leaves and cut off the hard part at the base.  With the cauliflower,  leave a little it of the leaves on for taste but discard the hard part of the stem. 
Mix vegetables in layers so all of one kind is not next to the other.  Put in the vegetables, garlic, then vegetables again, and so on.  Add 1 heaping tablespoon of salt for each liter of hot water that you will add to the barrel.  After the barrel is full with the vegetables and water, add 5 more tablespoons of salt on top, along with 2 tablespoons of mustard seeds, 2 tablespoons peppercorns and 4 bay leaves. You can use a cheesecloth bag to put the mustard seeds and peppercorns in or just throw them in loosely. Use clean wood sticks or empty glass bottles on top to hold down all vegetables under the water, if necessary.  It's important for them to be covered at all times. 
Mix the barrel (if it's large, it can be rolled on the floor!)  when done and shake it again each day for the next few days.   It's important to make sure it's being mixed well.  It should be ready in about 10 days to eat.  Kirby cucumbers may take a few days longer. Taste the liquid after the first couple of days, as you may need to add an additional tablespoon of salt or two.  It's important not to add too much salt in the beginning but to keep the balance constant and to add a little more as the salt is absorbed.  In our case, we added 3 tablespoons of salt on the sixth day, but this could change according to what you put in and the size of your barrel.

Did a garlicky/minty leg of lamb in the pit yesterday and it came out so good I thought I'd share with the porch.

Rather than insert slivers of lamb into the meat and apply a rub to the surface, I applied an herb puree to the inside of a boned, butterflied leg and rolled and tied it up.  The puree consisted of:

I rubbed the outside with oil, salt and pepper.  Cooked at about 250F with cherry wood until internal temp was 130F (medium rare).

 You just mix equal parts mustard, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and ketchup. Cider vinegar instead of the Worcestershire should work just as well.

   2      large         onions -- chopped
   3      tablespoons   vegetable oil
   1      can           crushed tomatoes -- (28 oz)
   2      cans          tomatoes -- with juice (14 oz)
   1      cup           apple cider vinegar

   4      tablespoons   Barbados molasses
   1      cup           orange juice
     1/2  cup           yellow mustard
   1      tablespoon    Tabasco sauce

This is actually my variation of Chris Schlesinger's Basic All American BBQ Sauce from Thrill of The Grill.  It is not a real sweet sauce like a Kansas City style.

In a large pot, saut� the onion in oil until tender.

Add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil.  Reduce to lowest possible heat and simmer uncovered for 4 hours.

Puree in a food processor or blender.  I use a hand held blender and puree it right in the pot.

                           Garry's Mexican Rice

Recipe By     : Garry Howard
Serving Size  : 4    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Sides

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      tablespoon    oil
   1 1/2  cups          long grain rice
   3 1/2  cups          water
   1      tablespoon    cumin seed
   6      cloves        garlic -- chopped
     1/2  medium        onion -- chopped
   1      can           tomatoes
   4      teaspoons     Wyler's Granulated Chicken Bouillon

This is my favorite way to make rice.  Although it is Mexican style, it can be served with just about any main dish, especially grilled meats.  I always make this when I have fajitas.  This recipe is adapted from one my mother acquired when I was a child so I grew up eating this rice. I was around 9 or 10 years old and we lived in Port Lavaca, Texas (on the Gulf Coast). There was a small family-run Tex-Mex restaurant that we used to eat in frequently. The enchiladas were great and the rice they served with them was delicious. One day my mother asked the Mexican woman who did the cooking if she would share the recipes and she did. The changes I have made is to add onion and the Wyler's bouillon, the original called for just water and salt. I also use a different cooking method that I prefer, cooking uncovered at first and then covering later. This produces perfect, fluffy, individual grain rice every time.

Drain and chop the tomatoes reserving the liquid. Add enough water to equal 3 1/2 cups of liquid total. Dissolve the bouillon in the liquid. Sometimes I use a large fresh tomato instead of canned.

Heat the oil over medium heat in a large frying pan. Add the rice and saut� until it puffs up and turns a light golden color. Add the cumin, garlic, and onion. Fry for about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and fry until any remaining liquid has evaporated stirring constantly. Add the liquid and stir to mix the rice. IMPORTANT - Do not stir the rice again!

Lower the heat and simmer the rice until the liquid level is just below the surface of the rice and holes begin to form in the rice, about 10 - 15 min. Cover the pan and continue cooking on very low heat until all the liquid is absorbed, approx. another 15 minutes.

Before serving stir and fluff the rice. I guarantee you will get rave reviews when you serve it.

                        Garry's Tex-Mex Enchiladas

Recipe By     : Garry Howard
Serving Size  : 4    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Mexican

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      dozen         corn tortillas
     1/2  pound         American cheese -- grated
   1      large         onion -- chopped
   1      large can     chili with beef no beans, your favorite
                        vegetable oil

When I was growing up, these enchiladas with rice and refried beans was the essence of Mexican food as I knew it.  I now make a lot more sophisticated types of enchilada sauces and use different cheeses but I still make these occasionally when I get the craving for them.  Also, we hardly ever have a family get-together with my mother and brother without making these.  It's funny how you can't really outgrow the foods you ate while growing up.

Warning, this is definitely NOT low-fat chow!

Add just enough vegetable oil to a frying pan to cover the bottom and heat over medium flame.  Fry the tortillas in the oil just enough to heat and soften them.  If the oil is too hot, or if you fry them too long, they will turn hard and crisp and you won't be able to roll them.  A few seconds on each side is usually enough.  Stack on a plate covered with a paper towel.

This recipe calls for American cheese.  For Tex-Mex enchiladas no other cheese will do.  American cheese has just the right salty flavor and melts to a great gooey consistency.  I buy a chunk of American cheese at the deli and grate it.  Make sure you have American 'cheese' and not the imitation cheese food stuff.  Even though most people don't accept American cheese as 'real' cheese, and it is processed, there is a difference.  Don't try to use those individually wrapped slices.  I like Land-O-Lakes white American best.

Sprinkle some cheese and grated onion on a tortilla and carefully roll into a tube.  Lay in a casserole dish with the seam side down.  Continue until all the tortillas are filled.  In a saucepan, heat the can of chili and pour evenly over the top of the filled tortillas.

Bake in a 350F oven until the enchiladas are heated through and the chili is starting to bubble.  Sprinkle remaining grated cheese on top and return to oven until the cheese melts.

Serve with Mexican rice and refried beans.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2  cups          yellow cornmeal
     1/2  cup           all-purpose flour
   1                    green onion - chopped fine
   2      teaspoons     baking powder - double acting
   1      teaspoon      salt

   1                    egg
                        vegetable oil for deep-frying

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, green onion, baking powder, and salt. Beat together the milk and egg in a cup and stir into the dry ingredients, just enough to moisten the dry ingredients thoroughly

Pour the oil into a heavy skillet or wide pot to a depth of 2-3 inches. Heat to 350F. Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls into the oil, being careful not to crowd the pot (fry in batches, if necessary).

Fry the hushpuppies until crisps and golden, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper toweling. Serve hot.

Serves 6-8

   1      tablespoon    hot pepper sauce

   2      quarts        beef bone stock
     1/2  pint          vegetable oil
   1 1/2  tablespoons   MSG -- optional

To make bone stock, buy stout beef bones and bake them in a medium oven for about 2 hours then boil them in water. Add all the other ingredients to the bone stock and let mixture stand overnight in the refrigerator before using. You can use canned beef stock, but it's not as good.

Use this mop to baste meats while cooking. Keep leftover mop refrigerated.

     1/2  tablespoon    crushed red pepper
   1      tablespoon    salt

Cut meat into large chunks. Place in a heavy pot and add water to barely cover. Simmer more than an hour. When the meat is very tender, drain and reserve any broth. Grind the meat with a coarse hand grinder or chop finely. (Using a food processor destroys the texture.) Grind one large onion. Place onion and the meat back into the pot and add one large can of tomatoes -juice and all. Add corn, vinegar and seasonings. Simmer a few minutes. Add the reserved broth to the meat until it reaches the consistency of stew. Serve it over white rice or bread with dill pickles on the side as a condiment.

   8      cups          beef or chicken stock
  10      cups          water
   2 1/2  cups          fresh/frozen corn kernels
   2 1/2  cups          fresh/frozen lima beans
   2      cups          fresh/frozen sliced okra
   2 1/2  cups          mashed boiled potatoes

In a large, heavy pot, fry the bacon over moderately high heat until crisp, then drain on paper towels, crumble and set aside.

Add the chicken pieces to the pot in batches, brown on all sides over moderately high heat and transfer to a platter. Add the beef to the pot, brown on all sides and transfer to the platter. Add the onions, celery and green pepper and stir until softened, adding a little oil if there appears not be enough in the pot.

Return the chicken and beef to the pot, then add the ham hock, tomatoes, parsley, hot peppers, thyme, basil, salt and pepper, stock and water and stir well. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 1 hour, skimming the surface from time to time.

With a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and continue to simmer the stew 1 1/2 hours longer. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones, shred the meat and set aside.

Add the corn, lima beans and okra to the pot, reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ham hock with a slotted spoon, pick the meat from the bone, shred and return to the pot. Add the reserved crumbled bacon and shredded chicken and stir well. Add the mashed potatoes, stir well and cook for another 15 minutes. Taste the stew, add salt and pepper to taste. Leftovers can be frozen.

                        Tabasco sauce

In saucepan, saut� onion and garlic in melted butter until soft. Add brown sugar, cook stirring continuously, until no longer granular. Add catsup, lemon juice and mustard and any optional spices. Bring to boil continually stirring, turn fire down to simmer. Cover pot with screen to permit thickening by evaporation, while preventing splattering of sauce. Stir once in a while to prevent burning on bottom. Takes about 15-min. With tongs dunk meat into sauce, shake off excess and grill over charcoal. Sauce keeps for several months when refrigerated. Can also be frozen then thawed in microwave.

This is a sweet/tart sauce equally good on hamburgers, poultry, pork ribs and chops, over cooked rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***SAUCE***
     1/2  cup           mayonnaise
     1/4  cup           extra-virgin olive oil
   1      tablespoon    fresh lemon juice
   1                    plump garlic clove -- minced
                        coarse salt -- to taste
                        ***MARINADE***
   2                    lemons; juiced
     1/4  cup           extra-virgin olive oil
   2 1/2  tablespoons   Dijon mustard
   1      tablespoon    sherry vinegar
   2                    garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2  teaspoon      coarse salt
  18                    baby artichokes
                        soaked bamboo skewers
   1      cup           pitted briny black olives

Remove the toughest outer leaves from the artichokes.

For the sauce: Prepare mayonnaise sauce, whisking together ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate covered for at least 1 hour. Reblend sauce if it separates.

For the marinade: Prepare marinade, combining ingredients in a broad, shallow dish. Trim any remaining tough edges from artichoke leaves and slice them in half vertically. Using a small spoon, remove the tiny fuzzy choke near the base of each half. Place each artichoke in the marinade promptly to avoid discoloration. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes.

Fire up the grill, bringing the temperature to medium (4 to 5 five seconds with the hand test).

While grill heats, drain artichokes, reserving marinade. Thread an artichoke half on a skewer, followed by 2 olives and then another artichoke half, avoiding crowding. Repeat with remaining ingredients and skewers.

Grill kebabs uncovered over medium heat for 15 to 18 minutes, turning to cook on all sides and brushing with reserved marinade at the same time. When done, artichokes should be tender and darkened with a few crisp edges. If grilling covered, cook for 12 to 15 minutes, turning once midway and brushing then with marinade.

Serve kebabs hot accompanied by mayonnaise sauce. Makes 1+1/2 dozen kebabs.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      teaspoon      ginger, ground [a]
   1      teaspoon      cinnamon, ground [a]
     1/4  teaspoon      nutmeg, ground [a]
     1/8  teaspoon      cloves, ground [a]
     1/4  teaspoon      salt [a]
   1 1/2  teaspoons     baking soda [a]
   1      pound         cream cheese at room temperature
     1/2  teaspoon      vanilla extract
   4      large         eggs
     1/2  cup           + 2 tablespoons white sugar

Mix [a]; set aside.  Beat cream cheese, preferably with an electric mixer, until smooth.  Beat in the vanilla, then 2 eggs, then the white sugar, completely incorporating each ingredient before adding the next.  Remove half the cream cheese mixture and refrigerate it.

Mix [b].  Beat in [a], then the remaining 2 eggs.  Stir in the flour in 2 batches.  Refrigerate this gingerbread batter at least 20 minutes.

With a tablespoon drop half the gingerbread batter in lumps, lines or strings onto the bottom of a greased 9" or 9-1/2" round Springform pan.  Fill the spaces with half the chilled cheesecake mixture.  Very gently cover the cheesecake lumps with the rest of the gingerbread. Fill the new spaces with the remaining chilled cheesecake.  Using the flat edge of a knife, swirl the pan contents to make a pretty pattern.  Be careful not to mix the 2 batters.  Gently pour on the room temperature cheesecake.

Bake in a preheated 350F oven 50 minutes, until the top of the cake begins to crack in the center.  The cake will be lumpy, since the gingerbread rises and the cheesecake sinks (that's why you add half the cheesecake last), but it's still nice-looking.  Cool to room temperature, then remove pan sides.  Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.

Serve cold.   It's easy to remove the pan bottom when the cake is cold: turn the cake over, run a knife carefully between the pan bottom and the cake, then remove.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Beef
                Jerky

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

Well I start with a lean piece of beef, usually brisket, sometimes eye of round. I cut it in slices about a 1/4 of a inch thick, then trim all remaining fat off, and cut into strips about a inch wide and six inches long. I place the meat in large Zip-lock type freezer bags. Then I marinate the meat over night in the soy-Worcestershire-sugar-salt-habanero marinade.

Then I lay the meat out on my racks, being careful not to allow the meat to rest in spots that have excessive heat (like the outside edges of my round water smoker grills).  I currently use a water/gas/wood smoker with a adjustable flame level and tin foil log made of soaked wood chips.

I sometimes use hickory and sometimes mesquite. I can fit about 8 lbs. of meat in my smoker, on about 8 racks all stacked on top of each other about a inch apart. I smoke/cook for about 8 hours, adding three new tin foil logs about every hour or hour and a half, when they stop smoking.

The meat around the edges tends to get done faster, then the stuff
in the middle, but I generally separate the well done stuff from the perfectly done stuff when I remove it all at once. I eat the well done
stuff nearly immediately, and save the other stuff for later, or give some away. I find it keeps in zip lock bags in the fridge nearly indefinitely or if your really concerned about it spoiling, it freezes extremely well too. I have also dried some out in a dehydrator and kept it un-refrigerated for more then a week and then ate it without any adverse effects.(but it's too dry to taste really good).

My marinade is basically this:
1 part Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce (a very sweet Teriyaki Soy based sauce)
1 part  Worcestershire sauce.
1 part Brown Sugar
1 part hot pepper water (I'll explain later)
1/2 part salt (to your taste)
quite possibly some additional water, up to two additional parts, depending on what I feel like and how much meat I had to cover vs. how much liquid I wound up with.

Hot pepper water.... I purchase habaneros periodic at the store for about $2 a pound and I dry them in my dehydrator.  I grind/crush the dried habaneros and put them in bottles to use later. I use about a 1/4 cup of dried crushed habaneros in my hot pepper water. I just boil them in the water and then strain out the rehydrated pepper remnants because
I don't want that stuff clinging to my jerky.   Be extremely careful when making and using this hot pepper water.  It can be very potent, and the steam from the boiling water can really be quite unforgiving to your lungs if you inhale a deep breath of it. You may even want to do this outdoors if you have housemates. Don't get any of this stuff near any sensitive areas of your body.

That's basically my method for making what I generally call HOT/Sweet Jerky.  You could use crushed red pepper instead of habaneros.

     1/2  cup           wine vinegar
   2      tablespoons   dry mustard
   1 1/2  cups          salad oil
   1      tablespoon    coarse pepper
     3/4  cup           soy sauce - maybe a little less
   2 1/4  teaspoons     salt -- optional
     1/3  cup           lemon juice
   1 1/2  teaspoons     parsley
     1/4  cup           Worcestershire
   2      cloves        garlic
     1/2  cup           barbecue sauce
                        --ketchup based - I use Kraft original
                        brown sugar to taste

Put all in blender - keeps months in refrigerator.

This recipe has a lot of the same ingredients as the Big Boy BBQ Sauce but does not have an overpowering ketchup flavor. I believe the Kraft sauce is used to give a "smoke" flavor to the sauce.

   1      small         lemon, (unpeeled), cut into thin strips

   1      cup           tomato catsup
     1/4  cup           chili sauce

In a large sauce pan, mix the vinegar and water. Stir in the onion, lemon, sugar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, red pepper flakes, and hot pepper sauce.

Stir over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Check and stir occasionally.

Stir in the catsup and chili sauce. Increase the heat and return the sauce to a full boil. Remove the sauce from the heat and let cool about 15 minutes before using.

This makes a great barbecue sauce for brushing on steaks and chicken--use lemon strips and all! Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour before grilling. Baste the meat with additional sauce while grilling. Serve hot off the grill with extra sauce for dipping. Yields about 1 pint.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Barbecue Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      bottle        Killian's Red beer
     1/2  bottle        Trinidad Tropical Bake & Grill
   3      tablespoons   Wild Willy rub
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1      tablespoon    honey
   2      tablespoons   olive oil

I have been using a commercial grill sauce called Trinidad Tropical Bake & Grill Sauce from Caribbean Food Products, Inc.  for about a year.  It is really good stuff.  It is blend of citrus juices and spices that has kind of a sweet-sour taste.  It is not a pepper sauce and has no heat.  I have used it plain, as a marinade for grilling and smoking, and also as a basting sauce.  At $3.95 for a 14 oz bottle, it is kind of expensive to use full strength, so I usually use it as an ingredient in my basting sauces.  I have not found it on the shelves locally, but many mail-order hot sauce suppliers carry it.

I did 4 slabs of spare ribs yesterday and rubbed them with the Wild Willy rub from the Smoke & Spice book 6 hours before cooking.  I made a mop sauce from:

I smoked the ribs for 6 hours at about 210 using maple logs for fuel.  Mopped with the sauce every hour.  They looked gorgeous, were very tender and juicy and tasted great! The maple smoke was a perfect compliment for the slightly sweet basting sauce.  I got a bunch of maple earlier this summer and have been using it a lot and I really like it.  Try the Trinidad Tropical Grill & Bake sauce if you can find it.  I think you will like it.

   3      tablespoons   olive oil and margarine -- mixed

   1      pound         fresh green beans
                        salt and freshly ground pepper -- trimmed, cut

Heat the fat in an enameled pan and mix in the tomato juice or sauce.  Add the green beans and parsley to the pan with enough water to almost cover.

Tuck the potato slices in between, partially cover the pan, and simmer for 25 minutes, the stir and season with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons chopped mint.  Cook uncovered until the beans and potatoes are fork tender, about 10 more minutes.  If the sauce has not thickened, pour it into a small pan, and boil down to one cup, then combine with the beans and potatoes in a warm serving bowl.  Sprinkle with a little additional fresh mint and serve warm.  Excellent with grilled chops, fish or egg dish, but equally good as a main course with cheese.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      tablespoon    oil
   2      pounds        chicken breasts boneless
   2                    onions
   2      teaspoons     minced garlic
   1      teaspoon      oregano
   1      teaspoon      cumin powder
   2      teaspoons     ground red chile
   1      tablespoon    red chile flakes
   1                    tomato
   1      can           tomatillos
   4      pounds        green chilies
   4      cups          Wyler's chicken bouillon
   3      tablespoons   cornstarch

Preferably use fresh roasted, peeled, and seeded New Mexican green chilies. Since these are not available in most parts of the country outside the Southwest, dried, frozen, or canned chilies may be substituted, in that order of desirability. Dried chilies are the next best thing to fresh.

Frozen new Mexican chilies under the brand name "Bueno" are available in some parts of the country and are good quality. Canned chilies are the least desirable but can be used if you are desperate. If possible use a mixture of canned and fresh or dried. Dried green chilies, and a large assortment of other dried chilies, spices, and Mexican food ingredients are available through mail order from Old Southwest Trading Company, P.O. Box 7545, Albuquerque, NM 87194. Call 1-800-748-2861 for a catalog. In September and October they will ship fresh green chile.

Cut chicken breasts into 1/2" cubes. Slice onions lengthwise. Chop chilies, tomato and tomatillos. Add oil to heavy, preferably cast iron, skillet and brown chicken over high heat. It is best to do it in two or three small batches. Remove to large saucepan. Add onions and garlic to leftover oil and brown until onions are soft. Add oregano, cumin, and red chile, and cook for two or three minutes.

Transfer from skillet to saucepan with chicken. Add tomato, tomatillos, chilies, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 - 4 hours. Add water as necessary to maintain the desired consistency. Add 3 - 4 tbs. cornstarch mixed with water prior to serving to thicken as desired.

   2                    salmon fillets
   2                    thin untreated cedar planks
                        lots ginger -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   lime or lemon zest -- chopped fine
   2      tablespoons   orange zest -- chopped fine
   1      dash          salt and pepper
                        olive oil
   2      tablespoons   Cajun spice mix
                        ***Cajun Spice Mix***
   1      teaspoon      oregano
   1      teaspoon      thyme
   1      teaspoon      paprika
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
   1      teaspoon      cayenne
   1      teaspoon      black pepper
   1      teaspoon      white pepper

I tried this recipe last weekend, and it was amazing. This is a variant of a signature dish of Emeril Lagasse (of the TVFN fame). The original recipe used horseradish and trout instead of ginger and salmon.

I had a hard time finding thin cedar planks (shingles) sold singly in the local hardware store, they seemed to only sell them in bunches of 40. I did however find untreated cedar shims that I was able to make do with.

So anyway, here's what you do. Preheat your grill and oil up one side of the cedar with your olive oil. Sprinkle a bit of the Cajun seasoning on the plank, and lay the filet of salmon on top. Season the filet with salt, pepper, and the spice mix. Cover the filet completely with the ginger and zest -- this adds flavor and helps the fish retain all of its moisture. Put the whole thing directly on the grill over the coals (cedar plank side down), close the lid, and stand back! The thing will smoke like crazy for a while. Check on the salmon after 15 minutes. If the plank catches on fire before the salmon is done, simply spray it with some water (I had to do this a couple times).

When the salmon is done, you can either serve the whole thing with the cedar flaming around the edges, or remove it from the cedar plank and serve. You may wish to remove most of the crushed ginger topping as it is a bit overpowering.

A nice sauce to accompany this can be made with soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil. I don't know the measurements, I just winged it.

     1/3  cup           sugar
   1      tablespoon    Tabasco -- (don't substitute)

Marinade overnight and grill.  It *will* flare up and about the only thing to do is either keep a squirt bottle nearby or my preference is to keep the garden hose ready and waiting.  For production jobs (cooking for a party) we use two grills, one to start the cooking at a slightly higher heat (most of the flareups) and one at a lower heat to finish (very few flareups).  Use your own judgement on when to switch grills - it should come natural even for novices, for some reason it'll just look like it's time.

   4                    Kaiser or other large rolls
   4      large         lettuce leaves

Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add onions and cook, stirring, until softened and starting to color, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add sugar, stirring until it dissolves and starts to bubble, about 2 minutes.  Add peaches and cook another 4 minutes, or until the mixture turns golden brown.  Add vinegar and sherry, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened and jam-like, 5 to 10 minutes.  Stir in crushed peppercorns and season with salt.  Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Prepare grill or preheat broiler.  Place each chicken breast between two layers of plastic wrap and flatten gently with a rolling pin or heavy skillet until approximately 1/4 inch thick.  Brush chicken breasts lightly with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil the chicken until no longer pink inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side.  While the chicken is cooking, toast the rolls on the grill or under the broiler.

Place lettuce leaves on the bottom halves of the toasted rolls, followed by chicken.  Top with peach-onion relish and the roll tops.

   2      tablespoons   garlic -- minced
     1/4  cup           fresh oregano -- roughly chopped
   2      tablespoons   paprika
   2      tablespoons   cumin seeds -- toasted
   3      tablespoons   grainy mustard

     1/3  cup           red wine vinegar
   4      16 Ounce      Delmonico -- (Rib-Eye) Steaks

                        sweet corn relish

In a small bowl, combine the first seven ingredients and mix well to make a paste. Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper. Reserve about 1/4 cup of the spice paste, and rub the steaks generously with the remaining amount. Place the steaks on the grill over a HOT FIRE and cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side for rare. If you like your meat more well done, cook it until it is almost the way you like it but not quite there, since it will cook a little more after you take it off the heat. To check for doneness: cut into the steak and check to see if the center is slightly less done than you like it. Remove the steaks from the grill, brush on the reserved spice rub, and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sprinkle the spring onions lightly with salt and pepper and place them on the grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, rolling over several times, or until the outsides are brown.

Remove the spring onions from the grill and slice in half lengthwise. Serve each of the steaks with a halved spring onion, a squeeze or two of lime, and a big spoonful of the Sweet Corn Relish.

Serving Ideas : Serve with Sweet Corn Relish.

NOTES : If you have ever seen green onions (aka spring onions), you know that they look like large scallions with a bulb about the size of a golf ball. These babies are just plain awesome on the grill. In Mexico, where they are constant companions to tacos al carbon, they are charred and served up with a little coarse salt and pepper and a squeeze of lime. If you ever see them in a market, buy them; they will rock your world.

   3      pounds        ground beef
   1      medium        onion -- chopped fine
   4      tablespoons   garlic powder
   3      tablespoons   paprika

   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   Tabasco sauce

   2      tablespoons   nuoc nam
   3      cups          beef broth
   4      tablespoons   flour

This was supposed to be a Salisbury steak recipe...it turned out tasting more like grilled meatloaf, but the end result wasn't too bad.

In a large bowl, mix all ingredients together well except beef broth and flour. Shape meat into steak sized oval patties, and grill over hot oak or hickory coals until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Put meat into a cast iron skillet, add beef broth and flour, and cook over medium heat for an additional 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently. When flour has cooked, remove from heat and serve. If you want a thicker gravy, add more flour to the pan at the start.

You can add sliced mushrooms to the gravy also. Top each "steak" with a cooked onion ring for that authentic K&W or Morrison's Cafeteria ambiance.

NOTES : I like to grill chicken wings for three reasons. First, they are easy and fast; second, they have an almost limitless versatility as to the flavors you can combine with them; and third, you have to pick them up with your hands to eat them.  That kind of sets the mood for the rest of the meal, letting folks know right up front that they can relax.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***MARINADE***
     1/2  cup           vegetable oil
                        grated zest of 1 orange
                        grated zest of 1 lime
   1      tablespoon    fresh basil -- minced
     1/2  tablespoon    dried basil
   1      teaspoon      fresh thyme -- minced
     1/2  teaspoon      dried
   1      pound         extra-large shrimp, about 18
                         -- shelled and cleaned
                        ***VEGETABLE SAUT�***
   1      tablespoon    vegetable oil
   3      cups          vegetables (use artichokes, fennel,red bell pepper)
                         -- cut into eighths, 1/
                         -- sticks about 2 inche
   1      clove         garlic -- minced
                        salt and ground black pepper
   3      tablespoons   balsamic vinegar
                        ***Citrus Sauce***
   1      tablespoon    orange juice
   1      tablespoon    grapefruit juice
   1      tablespoon    lime juice
   2      tablespoons   honey
   1      tablespoon    Dijon-style mustard

For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the shrimp and marinate for about 3 hours. (Note the recipe states to marinate at room temperature, but I would not leave it out for that amount of time. The safest thing to do is to marinate in the refrigerator.)

When the marinating time is over, make the vegetable saut�. In a saut� pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the vegetables and garlic; saut� for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper. Add the balsamic vinegar and continue cooking for 1 minute more.

To make the citrus vinaigrette, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Whisk to dissolve the honey.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill or broil for 2 minutes on each side.

Divide the saut�ed vegetables among 6 salad plates, put 3 shrimp on top of each, and pour on the citrus vinaigrette.

                           Grilled Leg Of Lamb

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Grilled
                Lamb

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***MARINADE***
     1/2  cup           oil
     1/2  cup           lemon juice
     1/2  cup           wine
   1      tablespoon    crushed garlic
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      tablespoon    rosemary
   1      tablespoon    pepper
   1      tablespoon    crushed red pepper

I used to do a lot of legs o' lamb while I was living in New Zealand.  I agree with Jeannie Voltz on this: a butterflied leg is perfect for a crowd.  Grilled 20 minutes on the side (maybe up to 30), you get a nice piece of meat that's well done in the thin bits and medium rare in the fat parts.  I marinate my lamb in something like the following:

Submerge the sucker for a couple of days.  A week isn't too long.  I don't think "low and slow" is the way to go with lamb.  I prefer grilling.  However, I'd definitely try low and slow with mutton.  Q'ing is designed for cheap, tough, and fatty cuts.  A good smoking would also kill the gamy taste.

   1                    bay leaf
   3                    black peppercorns
     3/4  cup           port wine
   1      pound         fresh cherries -- stems and pits removed
   1                    habanero chile
   						-- stems and seeds removed, minced
   3      cups          rich pork or chicken stock
   2      tablespoons   cornstarch
   1      tablespoon    water
                        salt and pepper to taste

Combine the brown sugar, mustard and soy sauce and mix well.  Spread the mixture evenly over the chops and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours.

Melt 1 ounce of butter in a non-reactive pan and saut� the carrot, celery, onion, ginger, thyme, shallots, garlic, bay leaf, and peppercorns until the onion turns golden brown.  Add the port wine, heat and reduce until thick.

Add the cherries and the Habanero and cook until all the juices are extracted from the cherries.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.

Remove from the heat and strain through a very fine sieve, pressing with a kitchen spoon to extract all the juices.

Return the strained liquid to a pan over low heat and whip in the remaining butter, 1 ounce at a time.  Dissolve the cornstarch in the water and add it to the sauce.  Heat and stir until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  Keep the sauce warm.

Grill the pork chops to desired doneness and serve with the sauce ladled over them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      pound         pork chops or loin
                        ***MARINADE***
   4                    limes, juice from (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup)
   1      tablespoon    vegetable oil
   3      cloves        garlic -- smashed or minced
   2      tablespoons   orange juice
     1/2  teaspoon      pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      salt

Mop: Juice of 1 or 2 limes

Meat: Pork (it rules!) boneless chops, pork loin cut into 3/4 inch thick slabs or anything similar.  Not too much fat...lean is good.

Combine the ingredients for the marinade.  Trim the pork, place in a dish sized so that the marinade completely covers the pork.  marinate 4 - 6 hours.

Over a fairly hot fire, grill the pork steaks until they reach at least 150F internally (I check it with an instant read thermometer).  Should take about 6 to 7 minutes a side.  Mop once on each side with fresh lime juice.  If you aren't into lime, skip the mop.  Serve with black beans and rice.  Not bad for an Irishman!

     1/2  cup           rum -- dark
   1      teaspoon      garlic cloves -- crushed

Seed bell peppers.

Peel mangoes and slice fruit away from central pit. Dice the mango fruit, red pepper, green pepper and onion. Combine all the remaining ingredients in a bowl. Mix lightly then add diced mango, pepper and onion. Mixture will keep in the refrigerator for three days.

Peel the shrimp and make a 1/4-inch deep incision on the top of each one (the side without the feet) from tail to the head. Under cold, running water, open the incision and wash away any brownish-black waste matter.

In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the lime juice, pineapple juice, rum, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Add he shrimp. Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours - no longer, or the shrimp will start to cook in the lime juice.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and discard the liquid. Run a skewer through each shrimp so that each is pierced in two places. Put the skewer through the tail area, then bend the shrimp over and put the skewer through the thick section in the upper body area.

You should be able to fit 4 shrimp on a 6-inch skewer or 8 shrimp on a 10 inch skewer.

If you are using wooden skewers, be careful not to leave any gaps between the shrimp, or the skewer will burn through. Place the skewered shrimp on a grill over medium-high heat.

Grill for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until the shells turn bright red.

The meat should be an even opaque white. Remove the shrimp from the grill ad serve on a bed of Mango-Lime relish.

Marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. Drain chicken from marinade and place on hot grill with the thin ends away from the flames. Cook, turning once, until just cooked through, 3 to 8 minutes per side, depending on heat intensity and thickness of meat. Do not over cook. Makes 4 servings.

                              Grilled Turkey

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Grilled
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    14 pound turkey
   1      cup           olive oil
   1      tablespoon    Herbes de Provence

Rinse turkey inside and out, pat dry with paper towels.   Pick off pinfeathers and other crud and excess fat.

Make a mixture of 1 cup Olive oil and 1 tablespoon of Herbes de Provence.

Crush the herbs in a mortar and pestle to help release their flavor. Actually any herb or flavoring you like can be used here.   Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Seasoning works nicely but does have some cayenne so watch out.   Baste the bird inside and out with this mixture and place on vertical roaster.  I place the roaster in an old pie pan that just fits the base.  This will catch drippings, avoid flare-ups and allow you to either baste with the drippings or remove them.

Prepare fire in grill and let charcoal burn to white ash.   I like to put a few 1/2 inch brick pavers on the grill over the fire and set the pie pan on these.  I think they help keep the drippings from smoking and turning the turkey black.   Add soaked wood chips for flavor to produce a moderate amount of smoke.   Baste with the olive oil and herb mixture a few times while cooking.   A small water pan placed in the grill will help keep the bird moist.

Add hot coals when necessary to maintain temperature.   A 14 pound turkey will cook in around 5 hours at a temperature of 250-300F.  Outdoor temperature will affect the cooking time of your turkey.  If you have a cold day placing the grill in the sun will help some, but extra charcoal and time (or a big microwave) will probably be required.   One way to see if the bird is done is to twist the drumstick, if it's loose, the bird is done.   Always check the internal temperature of the turkey with a meat thermometer.

Don't forget to save the skin and bones, they make great stock.

   6      ounces        chicken breast -- boned and skinned
   1                    egg
   2      ounces        heavy cream -- cold

                        pepper -- to taste
                        butter

For the chicken mousse: Puree chicken in a food processor until smooth.  Add salt and pepper and the egg.  Pulse just to combine and scrape the sides.  While food processor is running, add cream gradually through the feed tube.  Chill and reserve.  Wash and slice the mushrooms.  In a hot saut� pan, cook the mushrooms with butter. 
When mushrooms are brown, add shallots and herbs.  Remove from the pan and chill.  Fold together mushrooms and chicken.  Lay out plastic wrap on a table.  Down the center, spoon a 1-inch pile of the mushroom mixture.  Roll the plastic into a log.  Tie the ends with a string and tie into links. 
 Poach in simmering water for 10 minutes.  Shock the links in ice water.  This can be done up to 3 days ahead. 
To serve, remove the sausage from the plastic and grill, roast, or smoke, until it is hot throughout.  Slice the sausage and serve it with a tossed salad.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        lamb -- ground
   2                    toast slices -- crushed
   1      tablespoon    allspice -- pounded
   1      tablespoon    coriander -- crushed
   1                    garlic clove -- crushed
   1      medium        onion -- grated
   1      tablespoon    fresh savory -- chopped
   3      slices        bacon, cooked
   6      each          pita bread pockets
   2      each          tomatoes -- sliced thin
                        vinegar and oil to taste
   1      cup           fresh parsley -- chopped
   1      cup           plain yogurt

  In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice, coriander, garlic, onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead thoroughly.  The mixture should be spicy, though not too 'herby', and hold its shape.  Break into 5 sections, each as large as a navel orange, then break each section into 6 balls.  Knead and flatten slightly to a thickness of about 3/4".  Cut the bacon slices into widths equal to these balls, keeping the slices of bacon between them.  Slip a cane skewer through the     centers and roll gently with the palms to smooth the edges.  (There will be 5 or 6 skewers, depending on their length.)  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  When ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or grill and cook under moderate heat, turning every 5 minutes.  (The bacon will baste the meat.)  The surface will be crusty and the inside cooked within 25 minutes.   To serve:  Put out the bread, meat, tomatoes seasoned with the vinegar and oil, parsley and yogurt in separate dishes.  Guests may open pocket bread and stuff them with meat and seasonings.

Any way this is for 1 stick of butter, as that's the way I make em. I just mash 'em flat between wax paper.  No sense in making a pretty stick out of it, the object is to melt it on something.

Saut� the onion and garlic in oil until soft; add the carrots with a small amount of water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until carrots are soft.  Place the mixture and raw chilies into a blender and puree until smooth.  Don't cook the peppers, since cooking reduces flavor of the Habaneros.  Combine the puree with vinegar and lime juice, then simmer for 5 minutes and seal in sterilized bottles.  Heat index : 9 on a scale of 1-10.  Yields 2 cups

                        juice of 2 limes
                        salt and pepper

Combine tablespoon of olive oil and garlic and mix well. Rub tomato halves with this mixture, sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast over a medium-hot fire until thoroughly cooked (skin will turn brown). Remove to cool, and dice. Grill habanero peppers until slightly colored, about 2 to 3 minutes, allow to cool, and mince. Combine all ingredients. Will keep 5 to 6 weeks in refrigerator as no measly bacteria or virus will touch this stuff.

USE CAUTION - Habaneros are VERY HOT. This recipe is not for the faint of heart or stomach. Take care to wash your hands after handling and do not rub your eyes. You may want to consider keeping a case of Di-Gel handy and a pair of asbestos gloves.

Adjust number of peppers as needed.

   1                    bottle Killian's Red beer
     1/2                bottle Trinidad Tropical Bake & Grill
   3      tablespoons   Wild Willy rub
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1      tablespoon    honey
   2      tablespoons   olive oil

I smoked the ribs for 6 hours at about 210F using maple logs for fuel. Mopped with the sauce every hour.  They looked gorgeous, were very tender and juicy and tasted great! The maple smoke was a perfect compliment for the slightly sweet basting sauce.  I got a bunch of maple earlier this summer and have been using it a lot and I really like it.  Try the Trinidad Tropical Grill & Bake sauce if you can find it.  I think you will like it.

The Wild Willy rub is from the Smoke & Spice

  24      each          chicken wings -- separated
   2      tablespoons   vegetable oil
     1/4  teaspoon      garlic powder
   3      tablespoons   habanero sauce
   3      tablespoons   Tabasco Sauce
                        ground red pepper to taste
   1      tablespoon    white vinegar
     1/4  cup           brown sugar
   1      cup           bleu cheese salad dressing
                        leaf lettuce for platter

These chicken wings are quite easy to prepare.  Adjust the amount of Tabasco sauce and Habanero sauce to your own tastes.  I recommend though that you just cool them by dipping them in the bleu cheese salad dressing rather than decreasing the hot sauces.

 Preheat oven to 375F.   In a medium sized mixing bowl combine vegetable oil, garlic powder, Tabasco sauce, habanero sauce, vinegar and brown sugar.  Separate tips from wings.   Place tips and wings on cookie sheet(s).   Using a pastry brush, coat the wings with the sauce mixture.   Sprinkle ground red pepper over wings and tips.   Bake wings for 15 to 20 minutes or until browning has occurred.   Arrange wings on leaf lettuce and serve with your favorite beverage.   Dip wings in bleu cheese salad dressing for some cooling affect.

NOTE: These wings can also be cooked on the barbeque.  Wings should be grilled for the same amount of time over medium high heat coals.

Pound all this for a few minutes in a mortar (or pulse-process in a food processor) until the blend is a thick paste. Then thin it, if necessary, with a dribble of hot water until it is the consistency of bottled grainy mustard. Work the resulting rub evenly into the meat with the fingers and let it sit for about 30 minutes before putting it into the cooker. For beef ribs, omit the mustard seed and juniper berries.

Lower the cover and smoke the chilies for 2 1/2 hours, or until they are soft, brown, and slightly shriveled.

Remove the chipotles from the smoker. In a medium non-reactive saucepan, combine them with the chile puree, water, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and salt. Set over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring once or twice, until the sauce is very thick, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature.

Transfer the chipotles to a covered storage container and refrigerate
for at least 24 hours before using. They can be refrigerated for up to
2 weeks or frozen for up to 2 months.

UNSAUCED DRIED CHIPOTLES:  After removing the chilies from the smoker, place them on a rack and leave them, loosely covered, at room temperature, until crisp, light, and dry, 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the humidity. Store airtight at room temperature.

NOTES : Green jalapenos can be used, but red ones are more beautiful and have a deeper, sweeter flavor. Grow your own, or in the store, select chilies that have begin to turn red; they will eventually ripen. (Those picked without any red at all in their peels will always remain green.)

Curtis sez: "If you want to use store-bought dried chipotles (which means the time to make this recipe goes down to under 1/2 hour), it might help you to know that I just weighed 1 1/4 pounds of jalapenos, and it took 30 peppers. But since my jalapenos were on the small side, I'd think that 20-25 dried chipotles would be about the right amount."

  12                    fresh habanero chilies 
                        -- roughly chopped
   1                    ripe mango -- peel, pit, mash
   1      cup           cheap yellow prepared mustard
     1/4  cup           brown sugar -- packed
     1/4  cup           white vinegar

                        black pepper -- to taste

This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is basically habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and yellow mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in.  Use this recipe as a guideline.  Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper heat scale, so feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.

Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your imagination run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests regarding its origins.  If you're having trouble, here's a start:

"One day in Jamaica I was in this dingy bar and met this old guy who..." and you take it from there.

Mix all the ingredients together and stand back.  This will keep, covered and refrigerated, until the year 2018.  Be careful, though: If it spills, it will eat a hole in your refrigerator.  If you ever want to dispose of it, call the local toxic waste specialists.

WARNING: Hottest sauce in North America.  Use this to enhance dull and boring food.  Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children, and bad advice.  This is not a toy.  This is serious.  Stand up straight, sit right, and stop mumbling.

Be careful not to rub your nose, eyes, or mouth while working with habaneros.  You may actually want to wear rubber gloves while chopping and mixing -- these babies are powerful.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

Many people have asked me for my recipe for hot wings. I don't know why -- I can't cook. But I guess being from Buffalo means carrying an albatross or two, so here it is: 
HOW THIS BUFFALOON ENJOYS HOMEMADE WINGS:

Start with some chickens, preferably dead ones. If they have feathers, remove them (the feathers, not the chickens). If they don't, you're already two steps ahead of the game.

Meanwhile, heat up some oil in a pot large enough to hold the oil and some chicken parts. (Crisco, Mazola and Peanut work okay; Kendall, Valvoline and Quaker State don't.)

Now, go back to where your dead, featherless chickens are and cut or pull the wings off. Keep the wings and throw out the rest of the chickens. You won't need them (the chickens, not the wings -- you will need the wings). Cut each wing into three sections: the "Tip", the "Drumstick" and the "Flat Thing". You can throw out the wing tips (the chicken, not the shoes) because they aren't much good for anything. Only non-Buffaloons eat 'em. 
(On second thought, you can throw out the shoes, too -- or give them to Goodwill. Unless you happen to be extremely conservative, in which case you wouldn't consider eating wings in the first place, so why are you reading this?!)

Wipe your hands on your pants. Go into the bedroom and strip all the bedding off the bed except the sheet with the elastic stuff that holds it tightly to the mattress. Toss the rest of the bedding on the floor in the corner. Turn on the radio and/or TV and tune it to your favorite program. Adjust the volume to a comfortable listening level.

Go back into the kitchen (or wherever you prepare your food). The oil should now be heated to around 350F (Although I'm guessing ... my thermometer only goes up to 106). Stand about five feet away from the pot and toss the Drumsticks and Flat Things, one at a time, into the pot. The pot should come alive with the bubbling, boiling, hissing, and screaming of raw, moist, cold poultry parts being plunged into an environment in which their temperature is raised instantly by hundreds of degrees. If this doesn't happen, you probably turned on the wrong burner and your wife's favorite, very expensive, decorative, empty teapot is now irreparably scorched.

Now, get another pot (a smaller one than the one with the oil in it). Remove your wife's scorched teapot from the stove and throw it out (the teapot, not the stove). Put the empty pot (the one without the oil in it) on the burner. Put some butter on it (the pot, not the burner). Melt the butter. Put in Frank's Louisiana Red Hot or Tabasco to make the sauce mild, medium or hot. To make it Nuclear/Jeezuz-Kee-Riced, put in some Wild Bill Hickory's Habanero Hot Sauce With A Half-Life (Caution: Not for the weak of heart or stomach!)

By now or after five minutes, whichever is first or second, the wings in the pot with the oil should be golden brown, which we all know is non-sequitur because gold is not brown. They are, in fact, two different colors.

Take the pot (the one with the oil and the wings, not the butter) into the back yard and dump its contents on the lawn. (Unless you can figure out how to get the wings out of the boiling oil without burning yourself and slopping oil all over the kitchen, thereby raising the Wrath of Wife -- again.) Pick up the wings and wipe off the grass clippings. Leave the pot outside to cool. Carry the wings back into the kitchen (or wherever you prepare your food.) Wipe your hands on your pants.

Get a Cool Whip container. The large size works best. If it still has Cool Whip in it, scoop out the Cool Whip and throw it away (the Cool Whip, not the container). Wipe the container clean with your hand, and wipe your hand on your pants.

Put the butter sauce and the wings into the Cool Whip container and close the lid tightly. Dance around with the container, pretending you're Michael Jackson (but don't grab your crotch -- you need both hands to hold the lid closed), until the wings are completely covered with the sauce.

Get some celery sticks, a roll of paper towels, a jar of Marie's Bleu (sic) Cheese Dressing, a dinner plate (which, if you're like me, is probably used for other meals as well), and some beers.

   1      quart         whipping cream
   1      quart         plus 3 cups whole milk
  12                    egg yolks
   4      tablespoons   vanilla
   3      cups          sugar
   2      teaspoons     salt

Here you find two recipes: one for eggless ice cream and the ice cream with eggs. Personally, I like the eggless one the best. It seems healthier and a lot easier to make. You may find Junket in your grocery store and located in the sugar isle. Make and enjoy!

Eggless Recipe:
This is the recipe my mom made and believe me there weren't ever any leftovers.

Dissolve junket tablets in cold water. Mix milk, sugar and salt and heat to lukewarm. Add water and junket mixture, chill, add cream, vanilla and freeze. Add any fruit you wish if you don't want plain vanilla.

With Eggs:
Scald milk in a large 6 quart saucepan. In a large bowl, beat together egg yolks and salt. Add about 3 cups of the hot milk to the egg yolks slowly while stirring constantly. Then return this mixture to the milk in the pan. Add sugar and keep stirring while cooking at medium heat. When mixture coats the spoon or just starts to boil, remove from heat. In most cases, the mix will be lumpy. Don't worry. Just remember to strain out the lumps when you pour it into the canister. You will have lots of left over egg whites. Use them for Baked Alaska, Lemon Milk Sherbet, or make some meringue shells to serve ice-cream in.

This is a delicious, catering-quality custard ice cream. Please notice that it uses a ratio of approximately 2 parts milk to 1 part of cream. By substituting additional cream for some of the milk, it can be made even richer.

   1      teaspoon      crushed red pepper
   2      dashes        hot sauce

Saut� onions and peppers in a bit of oil. Simmer several hours. I cook in a cast iron pot for about 4 hours. If you have space on your BBQ pit grill...put pot on the smoker for last hour. If it thickens too much, you can dilute with a small can of V8 juice. Try this one. Got it years and years and years ago from a Texan friend.

This sauce may be varied to your personal taste. Make it hotter by more red pepper or sweeter by more brown sugar. Keeps well in the refrigerator or may be frozen. Great on beef, poultry and pork!

                        ***See Directions***      

I take two quarts of lowfat milk (just because it fits my favorite covered saucepan), bringing it to a full boil on the stove in a large pan, with room for the milk to expand when boiling.  Be careful to not let the milk boil over -- it makes a stinky mess inside the stovetop (not as stinky as my last homebrew boil over, tho').  Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.  Mix a spoon of the warm milk with a spoon of yogurt (can be store bought or starter from last batch), and stir into warm milk well.  Cover and place in oven (preheated to lowest warm setting, then turned off).  It takes about two hours for the yogurt to set.  It seems to keep for about two weeks in the fridge, but I usually eat it all long before then.

This yogurt is thinner than the sludgy stuff sold in the store, almost drinkably thin.  It makes wonderful Lassi, mixed with equal parts water and yogurt, flavored with a little sugar and rose water.  Excellent for cooling off the tongue if you stubbed your toe with the chile powder.

   2      pounds        pork loin

Whisk marinade ingredients and pour into a plastic freezer bag with the pork. Let sit overnight in the refrigerator.

Smoke the meat anyway you like it best. Take it out of the smoker at an internal temperature of no more than 150F. Let the meat stand for 15 minutes.

Heat the remaining marinade to a slow boil to thicken. Season with salt and pepper if desired. I cracked some pepper in it. Pour on the meat.

In a large saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, cola, vinegar, chili sauce, mustard, steak sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, oil, soy sauce, and Tabasco.  Stir well.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat.

In a small bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine the brown sugar, pepper, garlic salt, and dry mustard.  Stir or shake to blend.

Add the dry ingredients to the tomato mixture and stir well.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a brisk simmer, stirring frequently.  Cook for about 20 minutes or longer for thicker, more intensely flavored sauce.  The longer the sauce cooks, the less is its final volume.

Cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to low.  Cook for about 30 minutes until the flavors are well blended.  Cool to tepid.  Use immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 1 week.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16      each          Chicken drumsticks (2 /12 to 3 1/2 lbs.)
     1/4  cup           flour
   2      teaspoons     paprika
   1      teaspoon      black pepper -- ground
   1      teaspoon      white pepper -- ground
   1      teaspoon      cayenne pepper -- ground
   1      teaspoon      thyme -- ground
   1      teaspoon      garlic -- powder
   1      teaspoon      salt

The day before you plan to serve these drumsticks, lay them out on a cutting board or butcher block and pierce them all over with a fork so that, when they are seasoned, the spices will permeate the meat nicely.  Set aside.

Measure into a Ziploc-type plastic bag the flour, paprika, black, white, and cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and salt.  Close the bag and shake to blend the spice well.

Add the drumsticks to the bag, zip it shut again, and shake until the drumsticks are thoroughly coated with the seasoning.  Refrigerate overnight.

The following day, about 2 hours before dinnertime, fire up your smoker and, when the coals are glowing, add some wet wood to the fire pan and fill the water pan halfway with hot water.  Transfer the drumsticks from their bag to the grill and cover the smoker snugly.

Smoke at 200 to 220F for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the juice runs clear when the meat is pricked and the drums are lusciously tender.

                          How To Cook Whole Hogs

Recipe By     : Contributed By Dave Klose
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Pork
                Whole Pig

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

1.  Have the slaughter-house clean the hawg but have them leave on the head, all feet, and tail (a cap goes on the tail.) Also tell them not to damage the ears (some slaughter-houses think they have to suspend the hawg by grabbing them with some sort of hanging device around the base of the ears, but we have found that they can do this without harming the ears.) Also, if you can remember, have them prop the mouth open with a stick because an apple must go in the mouth, and most humans are not strong enough to open the mouth for this purpose.

2.  Hawgs in the weight range of 8O-12O pounds dressed (where dressed means a hawg that has been cleaned but has the head, feet, and tail attached.) usually cook best. We've cooked hawgs as large as 396 pounds dressed, but we don't recommend it. The amount of meat per person will depend on the group. An all-men group will consume a good bit more than a mixed group, particularly if the people in the mixed group have never attended one of these. If they have attended one previously and found that the hawg didn't kill 'em, then they will eat more. We suggest one pound of dressed hawg per person.

3.  We do not dig a pit in Mississippi due to the clay. Build a pit of concrete blocks two blocks high, five blocks long, and three blocks wide (for one hawg) on flat ground or slightly sloping ground which will help drain the grease away. This takes a total of 32 blocks. If you are short a few blocks, you can get by with 28 blocks by making the pit four blocks long.

4.  Line the bottom of the pit with freezer foil, not regular aluminum foil as it is too thin.

5.  Spread out a few bricks (five or six) in the bottom of the pit.

6.  Place a fine steel grate (or fine wire mesh) on the bricks in the bottom of the pit. This will prevent large grease fires if you pay attention and immediately put out the small fires which start when grease drops down on the hot coals. (Doss likes to use a water (squirt) bottle for this. I think that's cheatin' and should be done by using the small coal shovel to spread the coals away from the small fires.)

7.  Place the rods across the top of the blocks with another piece of fine steel grate on top of the rods. The hawg will go on top of this grate. (Actually we now use a steel grate that has long lengths of small sized angle-iron down each side that reaches across the pit and the hawg goes directly on this grate.)

8.  When the hawg arrives, start four or five pounds of charcoal in the charcoal cooker. (This cooker is used only to get the coals ready to place under the hawg.)

9.  To prepare the hawg do the following: Rip-out the kidneys and any extra tubes, etc. (like the aorta) that the hawg will no longer need. Take the single bladed ax and hammer and start splitting the backbone so the hawg will lay flat on the grate. (This method of cookin' is called butterfly cookin', so you want to open him up so he will lay-out (like a flyin' squirrel).)DO NOT CUT THROUGH THE SKIN or you will have BIG-TIME problems later on. In fact, don't cut the skin in any way, or poke any holes in the skin. After you get the hawg laid-out, the apple is next. Have your stoutest guy or gal pull the mouth open and stick an apple in it. I have seen this done once. If you have no Paul Bunyan around, use item 11 in the equipment list. The apple is necessary because he will bite the apple when he is done.

10.  After the hawg is prepared, lay him belly down on the grate. Place a nice hat on his head between his ears, shades on his eyes, and an Ole Miss baseball cap on his rear end. The hawg won't cook without these items.

11.  Now take pictures with the bosses up front and the real workers in the rear, or better yet with the real workers not even in the picture. The reason for the pictures is that all night long you will swear you are getting nowhere in cookin' this hawg, but 24 hours later you can prove you started with a raw hawg. The reason for the bosses being up front is because they will be there anyway. besides, this may encourage them to pay for everything, and they are of no use for anything else anyway.

12.  You are ready to start cookin` now. Use the small coal shovel to place 2 to 3 coals under each ham and each shoulder. (NO MORE COALS THAN THIS!)

13.  You will now start getting verbal abuse about how the hawg won't cook, it will be raw, any fool would know better, etc, etc. Tell them fine, they don't have to eat any of it tomorrow. Then replenish the charcoals you took out of the charcoal cooker and head for the beer cooler. (You only have to start the charcoal once. After the first time, simply spread the hot charcoal out so that when the charcoal gets hot, it is about time to put more coals under the hawg. I would guess this works out to be about every 3O to 4O minutes. More on this in instruction number 16 below.)

14.  Say you want to eat the hawg(s) at 5 P.M. on a Saturday. (All that follows relative to time will be based on this assumed eating time. For any other eating time apply a suitable forward or backward shift operator.) We usually pick the hawg up and get him to the site by at least 4 P.M. on Friday. You should be able to get him stated cookin' by 4:3O or 5:OO P.M. on Friday. The hawg is to be turned over only once. He will probably need to be turned over on his back between 8 A.M. and 1O A.M. on Saturday at that "moment-of-perfection," and I don't know how to describe to you what that "moment-of-perfection" is, so just turn him at 9:41 A.M. on Saturday.

15.  After starting the hawg at 5 P.M. on Friday, continue cookin' him by adding coals now and then. You can leave him uncovered on the pit for viewing until around 10 P.M. Friday night. Then you need to cover him. Cover him first with one piece of sheet iron that DOES NOT TOUCH THE HAWG ANYWHERE EXCEPT THE FEET AND EARS. We use a special piece of bent sheet iron that does not touch the hawg. Over this sheet iron place a small tarp that covers the pit. This is essentially our cooking oven.

16.  The rate at which coals are applied comes, I suppose, from experience. For the entire 24 hours of cooking, you should use slightly less than one pound of charcoal per pound of hawg. For example, for a 1OO pound dressed hawg (including head and feet), we would buy 1OO pounds of charcoal, but we would probably only use around 8O to 9O pounds of charcoal. The key to cookin' is to START SLOW and don't ever get much faster. Just be PERSISTENT. It is a low-temperature/long-duration cooking process. Every time one of our cookers have described to someone else how to cook a hawg, they usually cook too fast and ruin the hawg.

17.  After the hawg is turned over, grease will drip, or even run at times, so one should not put the coals where the grease drips. (Actually it will begin dripping long before it's turned but the greatest danger of significant grease fires occurs after turning.) We usually place the coals more around the edges after turning. This will not hurt the cooking rate because the sheet iron and tarp will be like an oven. This locating of hot coals is, of course, to prevent grease fires. We have never had a large grease fire since we started using the raised steel grate on the bottom of the pit. Before the use of the steel grate we had some big-time grease fires that even Ward would love.

18.  Also after the hawg is turned you should baste (or pour) barbecue sauce on the bottom side of the hawg which is now turned up. This doesn't get any barbecue flavor into the meat, it only keeps the meat from getting dry on this side, so any kind of sauce will do. We usually serve the barbecue sauce on the side, so that people can have hot, or mild, or whatever they want, or whatever you have to offer. Repeat this basting every couple of hours.

19.  When the hawg is done (by definition he is done at 5 P.M., and at this time he will bite the apple in two) pick him up by using the rods or sucker rod grate and move him to a place in the food line on the saw horses. Use two cutters, or pullers, on either side of the hawg. The best thing to do if the hawg is cooked properly is for these pullers to put on the rubber gloves (the thicker the glove the better because the meat will be hot) and simply pull the meat off and pull it apart. Do not use swine experts or veterinarians for this, as they don't seem to know the difference between a ham and a tenderloin. Be careful to not break the skin, the grease (which you will not notice dripping through) can ruin a good pair of Justin boots in no time.
