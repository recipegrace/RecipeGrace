YEAST:

Baker's yeast is a one cell fungus which in the presence of flours and water will feed and grow ( bud ) and reproduce new cells. It is with this process that oxygen and simple sugars are turned into carbon dioxide and alcohol. the carbon dioxide which is trapped in the dough fibers causes expansion and thus rising of the dough. the small amount of alcohol is evaporated during baking .......

FERMENTATION:  is the name for the chemical process in which yeasts become activated and give rise to the acidity in the dough ( starches broken down to sugars , then to carbon dioxide and alcohol) this process creates the flavor of the bread. Naturally a longer fermentation time offers the best flavor and taste. Breads rushed in this fermentation process may have an overly strong yeast flavor. Likewise breads that have over-risen may have a sour quality to them. However many people do not find either taste objectionable and enjoy the bread........

GLUTEN: is one of several proteins found in flour and holds the dough together making it more stretchable and elastic.Think of gluten as having a rubber or gum " stretchable" quality..When flour and water are combined the gluten is being activated. KNEADING of the dough helps continue to develop and activate the gluten.Too little kneading  produces a weak dough and a small compact baked product. Over kneading produces a chewy, coarse grained product..... . It is certainly possible to overknead a dough and cause the gluten strands to rupture causing the product to collapse but I don't think it is usually the case if hand kneading techniques are followed properly. Note:  We are discussing bread here not pastries and tender cakes which require a lower gluten ( or protein flour ). and limited kneading....Read labels on the flour for gluten content.

FLOURS are categorized as Weak: ( soft wheat low gluten/protein ), example cake flour around 8%,  or Strong: hard wheat ( high gluten/protein ) example bread flour 14 -16%. All purpose is a combination of both soft and hard wheat flours, 11% gluten content. All percents are approximates but give you an idea of protein content. Flours may be bleached, unbleached, bromated, contain additives and other conditioners etc. but these are topics for another time.

RISING: you will know when the dough is ready for its first rising after kneading, when the dough readily springs back when pressed with a finger. The dough should feel smooth like an ear lobe or baby's behind! BRead fLour usually needs 8 to 10 minutes of hand kneading whereas all purpose flour usually requires 5 to 8 minutes of hand kneading. For both flours done by dough hooks in the machine much less time is required.

The normal rising times for bread dough to double in volume is anywhere from 1 to 2 hours+, This depends on the type of dough ( eggs, fat, milk sugar present in dough ), the warmth of surroundings etc. Usually heavy dough ( sugar,fat etc. ) requires several risings opposed to lean doughs ( flour and water )to achieve the best texture .Don't be tempted to let any dough over rise more than instructed because the dough may be coarse, heavy or collapse.

Finger press the risen dough, if an indentation remains, its ready to be punched down( at this point it should not "spring" back if finger pressed.)

PUNCHING down dough: after rising it is necessary to do so, so the yeast cells are redistributed and thus causing a lighter textured, manageable dough.Follow recipes instructions.Many sweet breads have double or triple risings as I indicated above.

                  ****

To test your yeast to see if it's still active, dissolve 1 tsp sugar in 1/2 cup warm water (110 - 115 degrees) in a glass measuring cup.  Sprinkle 1 scant tablespoon yeast slowly over the surface.  Stir; allow the mixture to sit for 10 min.  Within the first 5 min, the yeast should begin rising to the surface.  At the end of 10 min, if  the yeast has doubled and reached the 1 cup mark and has a rounded crown of foam, it is very active.  Yeast that is inactive or losing Its potency will either not react at all or will not reach the 1 cup mark within 10 minutes.  In either case, discard the yeast and buy new.

Book by Madge Rosenberg

This is an excellent bread to make on the timer, to fill the bread machine
the night before and wake to the smell of banana, raisins, and yeasty bread.
Eat it warm - not hot - for an almost buttery taste.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and
process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.

This was very good.

  1 1/4           tsp.  yeast

Roll into a 10"X8" rectangle. Beginning at long end, roll up tightly as for jelly roll. pinch seams and ends to seal. Taper ends by gently rolling back and forth.
  Place loaf, seam side down, on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal(optional). Lightly brush with oil. Cover and let rise in warm, draft-free place until double in size, 20-30 minutes. With a sharp knife make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts about 1/4 inch deep across the top of loaf. Lightly beat egg white and 1 tablespoon water; brush some of the egg white mixture over top of loaf. Bake at 350 F.for 20 min. Brush again with remaining egg white mixture.
  Bake 5 to 10 min. more or until done. Bread should sound hollow when tapped. Remove the bread from the sheet; cool on a wire rack.

I have a Black and Decker (B1550 series bread maker) and this is the recipe that came in the book with the machine.

NOTES: 1. For Panasonic/National machines -- use 3 tsp. of  yeast for the 1 1/2 lb.
loaf.
2. If your machine has a mix cycle -- the almonds and raisins can be added at the beginning or at the mix beep.  They can also be added towards the end of the mixing process.

Because this bread is an extremely high rise, a 1-pound loaf will easily fill
 a large bread-machine bucket.  Test the small recipe first to see how the loaf
 rises in your machine.

Follow manufacturer's directions on loading.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  warm water -- (105-115F)
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  margarine -- softened
  30 1/2          cups  unsifted flour -- (61/2 to 71/2)
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  milk

Measure warm water into large warm bowl. Sprinkle in yeast; stir until
dissolved. Add sugar, salt, margarine, and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth.
Add enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly
floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place
in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place, free
from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Generously grease 4 strips heavy duty foil 10 inches long and 21/2 inches
wide. Place around edges of a 10 inch wire rack. Generously grease outside
of a large mixer bowl (about 8 3/4 inches in diameter and 4 1/2 inches
deep). Invert onto foil.
Punch dough down. Divide into 24 equal pieces; set 2 aside. Roll 22 pieces
into 30-inch ropes. Twist two together; repeat with remaining ropes. Wrap
twists of dough around bowl, beginning at bottom, touching foil. Pinch ends
of twists to seal. Cover entire surface of bowl.
Place 2 more greased of foil on a wire rack. Grease another bowl with the
same diameter. Invert onto rack. Roll reserved pieces of dough to 24-inch
ropes; twist together. Place over bowl, with ends touching foil, to form
handle for basket.
Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about
30 minutes.
Combine egg and milk; brush mixture gently on basket and handle. Place in
hot oven with wire racks directly on oven rack. (Do not use baking sheet.)
Bake at 400F, about 20 minutes, or until golden brown. For higher glaze,
brush basket and handle once during baking. Cover with foil, if necessary,
to prevent uneven browning.
Remove from bowl and cool on wire racks.
To serve, fasten handle onto basket, using toothpicks. Fill with dinner rolls.

                        Pizza dough

Having worked at Perkins, I have made a lot of bread bowls for chef's salads and chili bowls. The bowls come to Perkins restaurant in boxes of 40. Inside the box are units of dough that I refer to as cow pies. I lay them out on a sheet pan until softened in a proofing box, then, with a spray release, I cover either a small, inverted stainless steel bowl for the chef's salad, or an inverted porcelain chili bowl, and spread the dough as evenly as possible over the top. I wet my hands  with a whole egg wash while forming, then bake in a 375 degree oven for 12-15 minutes. The dough is labeled 'Italian bread bowl', but this is not Italian bread that I am dealing with. It's more like a pizza  dough that has oil in it. I think that pizza dough would be a good  choice, personally, as long as you use at least some oil. Straight  French or Italian bread would likely be rather crisp.

At home I have also tried making a pizza dough, forming it into 12 oz. balls, egg washing with a whole egg, and baking. After baking and  cooling I merely cut a circle around the top and rip out the excess dough. That way you can have your soup and have  something like soft croutons to put in. One extra step That I have also taken was to put the excess dough in the pan and lightly brown it in the oven, That  way, I have better style croutons. One way or the other, I prefer the home made dough MUCH better than the restaurant stuff.

                  ****

You can use any bread recipe you want. I usually use this simple one: Dissolve 2 packets of active yeast (4 1/2 t) in warm (~ body temp) water.

Add one cup of all purpose flour and one cup of wheat flour.  Mix until smooth. Keep adding flour (alternating all purpose and wheat) and mixing until very hard to mix. (about 2-3 cups) Turn out on a floured board. Knead until flour is smooth and not sticky - you will need to add more flour - another 1 1/2 - 2 cups, try to divide evenly between all purpose and whole wheat. Roll the kneaded dough into a ball. Put in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat the whole surface with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubles (1 to 1 1/2 hours). Then punch down. Let rest 10 minutes. Divide into 4-6 smaller balls, and put them on cookie sheets.  Flatten the balls into disks and let rise for about another hour. If desired, brush with egg white (I usually don't) Cook at 375 for 40-50 minutes. Bread should sound hollow when thumped. Remove from oven and let cool.

Here's the tricky part. You will have 4-6 round loaves. Cut a circle out of the top of each loaf, and remove that piece of crust. You will have a thick crust bread with a circle of exposed softer bread. Smush down the inner part (you can scoop out the bread if you want to, but I prefer to leave the bread to soak up the gravy).

This works great for stews and chili. If you don't let the circles rise you should get flatter loaves for 'trenchers', but I haven't tried it yet.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  Poultry seasoning
  3 1/2           cups  bread flour -- * see note
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Yeast

 *Can substitute 2 1/2 c  bread flour and 2/3 c  Cornmeal.

Load machine in order given. Use regular bread cycle.

The following is a recipe that I have adapted a good bit, but it might do what
you want.  I use it to make bread for turkey stuffing, but have adjusted the
amount of seasonings many times.  If you are going to use it just to eat rather
than for stuffing, you might want to reduce the seasonings to 1 tsp each or
less.  Just experiment with it and eventually you will find the amount you
like.  Of course, you are going to have to eat your mistakes! ::))

This bread also makes excellent croutons, so if you have a batch that is too
strongly flavored for the table, cube and dry it. [Bill]

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  milk
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  dry yeast
                        (mine goes from freezer to bread pan)
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
  1                tsp  salt
  4               Tbsp  butter -- (1/2 stick) melted

Makes 12 rolls

This is my procedure; yours may differ:  Heat milk and water to 90 F in microwave. Add ingredients to bread pan in order shown. Drizzle melted butter over flour. If "raft" forms, break up with spatula.

Select KNEAD AND FIRST RISE cycle.

When dough is through first rise, form rolls one of the following ways, dusting the work surface with a bit of flour if necessary. Place formed rolls on greased baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size. Tops can be glazed with a wash of egg and a bit of water, but it isn't really necessary.

Preheat oven to 400 F. When rolls are put in, turn oven down to 350 F. Bake for 10 to 20 minutes until rolls are light brown.

Butterhorns and Crescents:  Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Roll each into an 8-inch circle. With a pizza cutter or knife, cut each circle into 6 wedges. Roll up wedge toward the point, pulling and stretching the dough slightly as you roll. Place on baking sheet with point underneath. For Crescents, curve roll into a crescent shape.

Bowknots and Rosettes:  Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Roll each into a thick rope and cut into 6 equal pieces. Roll each of the 12 pieces into a slender 8-inch rope. For a Bowknot, tie each into a knot. For a Rosette, bring one end up and through the center of the knot, bringing the other end over the side and under. Press end to the baking sheet to keep them from untying.

Note:  Can also make Parker House, cloverleaf, fan-tan, and pan rolls. See Bernard Clayton, _The Complete Book of Breads_ or other reference.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark molasses
  2        tablespoons  caraway seed
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  rye flour
     1/2           cup  pumpernickel -- **
  2        tablespoons  gluten
  4          teaspoons  yeast

Add ingredients as per your machine's manufacturer instructions. Jerry bakes on White Bread setting; I use Whole Wheat Setting.

**Note:  We purchase pumpernickle at a wonderful local mill, and it's quite coarse, resulting in "bumpy" bread. If you prefer a finer-textured bread, you may want to grind the pumpernickle in a coffee mill before adding it.

NOTES : For Michelle, who asked for Cardamon bread:  This recipe is from a friend of mine. I've made it for the last 2 Christmases (actually on New Year's Day) and it is spectacular warm from the oven. Try to use freshly ground cardamon -- buy the whole pods and grind just before you bake the bread.  I've never tried it in the ABM, only by hand with my Kitchen Aid, although it could probably be cut in half for a large machine. No special utensils necessary!

                        Christmas Cane Coffeecake

Recipe By     :WCTC Yeast Breads Class
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Holiday Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  milk
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  4 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
  1                cup  cold butter
                        CRANBERRY FILLING:
  1 1/2           cups  cranberries -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/3           cup  chopped pecans
     1/3           cup  honey
  1           teaspoon  orange rind -- grated

Note:  I have made this dough using 70 degree water and allowed the dough
to rise while in the refrigerator.  It works fine!

DOUGH-
Soften yeast in  warm  water  (110 degrees).  Heat milk  to  lukewarm,
blend in softened  yeast  and  eggs.  Combine  flour,  sugar,  salt  and
lemon rind.  Cut  in  butter  until  mixture  resembles  coarse  crumbs.
Add yeast mixture; mix well.       DOUGH IS SOFT!

Place  in   greased bowl; cover; refrigerate overnight.  Divide  dough into
thirds.
Roll each third on floured  surface  into  a  6 x l5 inch  rectangle.  Spread
1/3 of Cranberry Filling lengthwise  down  center  of  dough  in  a  2 inch
wide strip.  Cut  dough  with  scissors  from  both  outer  edges  toward
filling.  Make cuts every  1/2 inch.  DO  NOT  CUT  TOO  CLOSE  TO  FILLING.

Crisscross pieces  of  dough  over  filling.  Place  on  greased  cookie
sheet. Stretch shaped  dough  to  about  20";  curve  top  to  form  a
cane. Let rise about 1/2 hr.  Bake at 3750 about 25 min. Frost
with thin  powdered  sugar  glaze  and  decorate  if  desired.  Makes  3
canes.

FILLING-
Combine all ingredients.  Cook  over  medium  heat  about  5  min-  Stir.
Cool.

Notes:  This is, without a doubt, the best coffeecake I have made.  it is the most
requested from my friends/family.  I like to shape it as a wreath ( instead
of a candycane) and put a poinsettia in the middle as a decoration for
Christmas morning!

This can be shaped as a wreath or braid too!

                        -- 2 lb recipe ( a high loaf)
  1                cup  water
  6        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  oil
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  dry milk
  4 1/2           cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
                        -- (I use SAF yeast use and only use 2 1/2
                        -- tsp )
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
     2/3           cup  raisins
     2/3           cup  walnuts

For toatmaster place ingredients in order listed ( otherwise follow your manufactures instructions ) except raisins, nuts and cinnamon ! Select sweet bread program. light crust ( I use medium and its fine ). Add cinnamon, nuts and raisns at the beep ( which would be approx.the last 10 minutes of the last kneading cycle ).
Note: we dont always add the nuts and just increase the raisins.
EnjoY!

Notes: The recipe that follows was in last weeks Digest.  It looks like something I would love to eat, so I tried it.  I made two changes from the beginning: I substituted pistachios for walnuts, and, since I couldn't get unsalted pistachios, I reduced the added salt to 1 1/2 tsp.

First of all, my machine (a 2 lb Black & Decker) almost stalled because the dough was so stiff with the listed amount of liquid.  I added more until the amount of liquid totaled 1 1/2 cup.  Even so, the loaf came out with a gnarly top.  My instruction book says this is a sign of insufficient liquid. How does one account for the different amounts of liquid required?

Second, the bread did not rise as much as my most successful breads do, and the texture is fairly doughy.  Suppose next time I make this, I use 1 1/2 cups plus 1 TBSP liquid; would getting the dough stiffness right also help the amount of rise and texture?

Incidently, I hadn't previously thought of adding the cinnimon with the raisins and nuts, and I found that doing it later leaves nice swirling patterns in the finished bread - kind of attractive.

>From: David Schellenberg <dschellenberg@man.net>


Dont bother to add a dough conditioner since the lemon juice conditions the
dough. I experimented and did add extra powdered
dough conditioner and the bread came out too soft and didnt cut well.The
Toastmaster breadmaker uses 1 tsp lemon juice in all their bread recipes.You
may want to try this with any of your abm recipes. Their bread booklet
suggests lemon juice or vinegar ( both acidic )  which helps in the
structure of the loaf of bread. And their comment about cinnamon: dont add
more than instructed since cinnamon ( as well as garlic ) inhibits the
growth of yeast. Thought Id pass it on to those who didnt know

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Filling:
  3               Tbsp  butter or margarine -- melted
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2                tsp  ground cinnamon
  1                tsp  lemon peel -- grated
     1/2           cup  raisins
                        Glaze:
     1/2           cup  confectioner's sugar
  1               Tbsp  lemon juice -- (1 to 2)

Make same dough as Buttery Dinner Rolls, through first rise.

On a lightly floured surface, roll and spread the dough to a 12 inch by 15 inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and lemon peel; sprinkle evenly over the butter. Sprinkle with raisins.

Starting from a long side, roll up the dough tightly. Pinch the long edge of the dough into the roll. Slice into 9 rolls. Place in a greased 9 by 9-inch baking pan, cut side up. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Bake at 350 F for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes.  Combine 1 Tbsp lemon juice with the confectioner's sugar, adding only enough additional lemon juice to make a very thick glaze. Drop and spread with a teaspoon over the rolls.

Note: I'm thinking about trying orange peel and juice instead of lemon, but haven't done so yet.

  1                     egg

Here's a recipe that's too big to bake in your machine, but it
will mix and knead it.  It's a beautiful braid.

Put in machine on dough cycle.

When the machine beeps, take the dough out and roll out 12 x 18 rectangle.
Cut dough into 3 (4" wide) strips.  Mix filling:  1 minced clove of
garlic, 1 tbsp Parmesan cheese, 1 tbsp poppy seeds, and 1/4 c butter,
melted.  Carefully spoon this mixture along the middle of the the strips.
Fold over long side, pinch together.  Place the three strips on
greased baking sheet about an inch or so apart.  Carefully braid from the
center loosely out to each end.  Press the ends together and tuck under.
Cover; let rise until double.  Before baking, brush with 1 egg yolk mixed
with 1 tsp cold water and then sprinkle with poppy seeds.  Bake at 350 for
30 to 35 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                  ****

STANDARD RATIO OF INGREDIENTS FOR THE ABM:

3 cups bread flour + or -
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
2 tsp yeast
1 1/4 cup liquid  + or -

Place ingredients into breadmaker as manufacturer instructs. Lead knead a
few minutes. Add either more flour or more water to produce a pliable
non-sticky dough ball. when pressed with finger dough should be slightly tacky but
no dough should adhere to your finger.

When it comes to things as eggs, liquids, oil etc be sure to count this into
the liquid portion total.When it comes to additions of non-gluten flour like rye,
corn, or whole wheat etc. ( this has gluten but  the sharp
strands of its own gluten deflate the cells as they rise )  you can also
count this into the 3 cup total.

So look at the recipe you want to convert and
experiment in your bread machine. Usually after 1 or 2 tries you'll get it
right. Of course some recipes are not cut and dry, so extra experimenting may
be necessary.

Following example:  this is a 4 non standard
loaf which I wanted to convert for my ABM

WALNUT BREAD
straight dough method
yield: 4 loaves

5 cups flour (or more )
1 tbs salt
2 tbs sugar
2 pkt yeast
2 cups warm milk
1/2 cup walnut oil
or
fruity olive oil
or
1 stick butter
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup chopped onion

Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm milk till foamy. sift flour, sugar, salt into
a large bowl.Make a well in the flour mixture and add the yeast mixture,
with oil or melted butter and the remaining milk.Knead dough until springy
adding more flour if necessary. cover and let rise in a warm place until
double.Punch down and mix in walnuts and onions.Shape into 4 rounds and
place in a greased casserole dishes. Let rise double. Bake 400 for 45 minutes
or until done and golden. Remove to racks to cool.


WALNUT ONION BREAD FOR THE ABM

3 cups bread flour + or -
1 tsp salt
2 tbs sugar
2 tsp active dry yeast
1 cup milk ( or water )+ or -
1/4 cup oil
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup chopped onion

Place ingredients in the order as instructed by manufacturer.Add more flour
or water or whatever the case to get the pliable non sticky dough consistency.
During the last 10 minutes of the last kneading cycle ( or if your machine beeps
to indicate additions ) add the nuts and onions. I use the regular cycle for
white bread ( my machine is a Toastmaster)

Note: often some
breads made with walnuts will have a reddish brown discoloration
coming from the nuts.It doesn't alter the taste though.

Hope this helps people who want to convert recipes.
All it takes is time and experimentation.  If you get to know your
ingredients and how they function in a bread recipe then you are certainly
off to a good start!

First, you take a "disposable/recyclable" heavy foil type round pizza pan (
at least 10-12 inches in diameter) from your local grocery.  Cut (one-
straight line) from the center to the outer edge of the pan.  Now (being
careful not to cut you precious kneading fingers) roll the foil pan into a
cylinder where the opening is about 3 inches in diameter, and the other end
is rolled smaller and tighter. ( you may need to staple this to hold it in
place) Bend and shape the cylinder to resemble a horn-o-plenty. Don't bend
the end too much, because the mold will not remove from the finished
product.

Take 1 inch by 6-10 inch by 1/2 inch strips and place them around the
(greased  with non-stick spray) mold.  Pressing the strips together to join
and seal them together.  Let it rise briefly.

Bake at 325 until golden brown.  Let it cool and carefully remove the mold.

This can be used as a wonderful centerpiece for your Thanksgiving feast.

  3 1/2           tsps  active dry yeast
  1 3/4              C  warm water
  2               Tbsp  honey -- or sugar
  6 1/2              C  unbleached white flour -- (6 1/2 to 7 1/2)
  4               Tbsp  corn oil
     1/2        medium  yellow onion -- finely diced
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/2             C  cottage cheese
     1/4             C  dried dill weed
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                     egg -- plus
  1         tablespoon  milk -- for wash

Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl; stir in honey and 2-1/2 cups of the flour. Beat to smooth batter, set aside in warm place til doubled in bulk--about 45 minutes.

While dough is rising, heat 1 Tbsp of oil and saute onion in it until it softens; set aside to cool. When dough has risen, stir in the onion, eggs, cottage cheese, dill weed, salt, and the remaining 3 Tbsp of oil.  Mix well. Fold in 3 C flour gradually; when dough is too thick to fold in any more flour, turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny -- 5 to 8 minutes. Put dough into an oiled bowl, turn to coat with oil, and rise in warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.  Punch down, let rise again -- about 30 minutes.

Shape into two loaves, place in oiiled pans, and let rise to tops of pans -- 20 to 25 minutes. Preheat oven to 350-degrees. Brush loaf tops with egg wash, bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until browned. (Note: very delicate crumb in these loaves; tempting as they smell fresh from the oven, it's best to cool them some before cutting.)

Breads & Cakes: There are a few tricks to remember when "baking" in one of these pots. First, turn the control to HIGH (or to the setting which is equivalent to the HIGH used in the recipes). The LOW setting is too low to give breads and cakes the texture you expect: With breads, remember to cover the container with a lid or foil. Tie the lid or foil onto the container and place the container on a meal rack or trivet inside the pot. If you don't have a metal rack or trivet to fit your slow cooker, crumple foil and place it in the bottom of the pot to support the baking container. Pour 2 cups of hot water around the container to provide steam for cooking the bread: When using a deep fryer type of slow cooker, check frequently to make sure the water hasn't evaporated. Add more water if needed. In general, it is not a good idea to remove the lid or foil from   the bread container during the first 2 hours of cooking. After that,   check the bread by inserting a toothpick in the mixture. If the   toothpick comes out clean, the bread is done.When using a standard cake mix, the procedure is slightly different. Cakes are "baked" in a pan set directly on the bottom of  the slow cooker, similar to the way you would do it in an oven. It is not necessary to use a trivet or water. Instead of covering the uncooked cake mixture with foil or a lid, cover the top with four or five layers of paper towels. Because there is more moisture in a slow cooker than in an oven, it is necessary to compensate for this with the paper towels to help absorb the moist top of the cake mix. Also, leave the lid of your slow cooker slightly open to let extra moisture escape. The type and kind of container to use for breads and cakes will depend on the size of your pot. The following containers hold equivalent amounts of batter, and so will substitute for each other: Coffee can, 2 lb two coffee cans,1 lb Mole, 6-7 cup capacity baking dish,1 1/2 quart Three vegetable cans, 16 oz Souffle dishes and springform pans also work, when they fit in the pot.

toxic gases when heated.       This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up
and store them in your   pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you
can; here's how:       Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of
jar clean; put   on lid and ring and screw on tightly.       Jars will seal
as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.       If you'll be giving these
as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth   (about 1-inch larger in
circumference than the lid or as large as   you'd like) and put it on top of
the lid, then screw on the ring.   Make sure you screw the lid on very
tightly. I like to use pinking   shears to cut the cloth out with.

                           Date Nut Bread <R T>

                Low Fat                         Nut & Seed Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 Lb Loaf: -- (1 1/2 Lb Loaf):
  1 1/2            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- (2 1/4 Tsp)
  1 1/2              C  Bread Flour -- (2 1/4 Cups)
     1/2             C  Wheat Bran -- (3/4 Cup)
     1/2             C  Brown Sugar -- (3/4 Cup)
     3/4           Tsp  Salt -- (1 1/4 Tsp)
     3/4           Tsp  Ground Cinnamon -- (1 Tsp)
  2               Tbsp  Margarine -- (3 T)
     1/4             C  egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute -- *Note, (1)
     3/4             C  Water -- (1 1/4 Cups)
     2/3             C  Chopped Pitted Dates -- (1 Cup)
     1/4             C  Slivered Almonds -- **Note, (3/4 Cup)

Moist, sweet, healthful, and long lasting, this loaf tastes of fruit and
cinnamon, with a crunch of nuts.  Make it into the classic tea sandwich (low
or nonfat) regular cream cheese or spread with (low or nonfat) regular
ricotta cheese and grill until golden.  But it is wonderful plain also.
Makes a great gift.

*NOTE: Original recipe used 1 regular egg for both small and large loaves.
**NOTE:  Original recipe used 1/2 C chopped walnuts for small and 3/4 C for
large.

Add all ingredients except the dates and walnuts in the order suggested by
your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to
the manufacturer's directions.

At the beeper (or at the end of the first kneading in the Panasonic or
National), add the dates and walnuts.  Let the bread cool before slicing.

This is incredibly good!!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
  1                cup  rye flour
  1                cup  cornmeal
  2               cups  cracked wheat -- (bulgur)
     1/2           cup  non-fat dry milk -- powder
  4          teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/4            oz  active dry yeast -- one package
  1                     egg
  1         Tablespoon  milk

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Combine in a big bowl, the flours, corn-
meal, milk powder and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup lukewarm water; let sit for a few minutes,until it bubbles. Add the chicken stock to the yeast mixture. Mixwell. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients. Knead about 3 minutes. The dough should be stiff.

Flour a board with cornmeal and roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut out biscuits with cookie cutters in appropriate shapes, and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Mix the egg and milk and use to brush tops of biscuits ( for shine), then bake the biscuits for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave biscuits in the oven overnight. This will make the biscuits be bonehard.

Preheat oven to 350. Combine the ingredients. Roll out to 1/4 inch thick and
cut out with cookie cutters. Bake at 20-25 minutes.   Allow the cookies to
cool before serving.

Allowing them to sit out overnight will make them harder, which is good
for cleaning doggie teeth.

                        -- flour although all-purpose is generally
                        used in quick breads

Preheat oven to 425 F !
Mix all the ingredients together by hand with a fork  as you would for biscuits, i.e. gently  and quickly until a dough ball forms, leaving the sides of the bowl. Place dough on a greased baking sheet. Use a piece of plastic wrap to cover the dough so you can easily shape it into a round loaf with your hands.( it's a sticky dough that's why ) Remove plastic, use a sharp knife and cut, slash an "X" across the top of the dough. Dust top of loaf with flour.( for looks only ) Now use a large metal bowl and completely cover the loaf with it! Bake in the preheated 425F oven for 30 minutes. Remove bowl ,( careful, steam will escape,) and return bread to the oven and bake another 30 minutes at 425 or until golden. You should have a crusty loaf with a lovely moist interior.

Note: my bread finished baking in 15 minutes after the bowl was removed not 30 and was a good golden brown. This truly tastes best when served warm.
Enjoy!

NOTES :
I just saw this recipe on t.v. the other day and was intrigued by it.I made
the bread and it is good when fresh from the oven with butter and jam.
Toast it the following day. It's bare bones, no fat since I used skim milk.
Although a quick bread, it had the texture and quality of almost a yeast bread.
However the method of covering the loaf indeed did produce one of the
crustiest loaves I made. I am contemplating experimenting using this idea
with yeast based recipes.

Here it is for all those curious bread bakers who want to try something new!
BTW, the demonstrated bread used regular milk and baking powder so that's
what I tried the first time for my loaf.
This is not a sweet bread and there is no sugar in the recipe if you were
wondering. And it tastes nothing like Irish soda bread!

     1/2           cup  skim milk -- Lukewarm, Or
                        Rice Milk Or soy milk
  3 1/2           cups  All-Purpose Flour -- Unbleached
  1                cup  Whole-Wheat Flour
  1           teaspoon  Salt
  1                cup  warm water -- *Note
  3          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- crushed
  3          teaspoons  Sesame Seeds
                        Cornmeal -- As Needed

Slightly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, this bread is perfect
for dipping in soup or sopping up the juices of a tagine (Moroccan stew with
lots of vegetables in it).

*NOTE: Original recipe used 3/4 C lukewarm water...the dough was too stiff
for me to work with so I increased the water.

In a large bowl, stir sugar or Sucanat into water.  Sprinkle in yeast; stir
slightly and set in a warm place until yeast is bubbly, about 10 minutes.
Add milk,  rice milk or soy milk.

In medium bowl, mix flours with salt.  In 3 to 4 batches, stir flour into
yeast mixture.  Add lukewarm water gradually, as you may need more or less.
(I had to add more then the original 3/4 C)   Stir until dough forms stiff
ball.  Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 8 to
10 minutes.  Sprinkle in fennel seeds and sesame seeds during last minute of
kneading.

Divide dough equally.  In lightly oiled mixing bowl, form dough into ball by
rolling against sides of bowl.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Sprinkle small
amount of cornmeal on baking sheet; flatten balls slightly on sheet.  Cover
dough with plastic wrap and let rise 2 hours in a warm place (see note).

Preheat oven to 400 deg F.  Bake dough 12 minutes, then lower heat to 350
deg F and bake 30 to 45 minutes more.  The bread will be slightly browned
and will sound hollow when you tap it on the bottom.  Let cool before serving.

Makes 2 loaves (12 slices each).

NOTE: If you don't have a warm place, put the baking sheet on top of a large
bowl filled part way with warm water.

                   Food Processor Method (French Bread)

Recipe By     :Way to Cook, Julia Child

Categories    : Bread Machine                   Bread-Bakers Mailing List

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  yeast
     1/3           cup  warm water
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ascorbic acid
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- (about 1 lb)
  1         tablespoon  gluten flour -- PER CUP of flour
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  cold water


1.   Dissolve yeast,sugar and ascorbic in water.  Stir cup of cold water into
yeast mixture. Add 2 tbls. olive oil. Set aside.
2.   Measure flour,gluten and salt into processor bowl with plastic blade. (I
have a Cuisinart 11)  Pulse to combine.
3.   Start machine.  Slowly pour liquid into processor.  A ball should form
in a few
seconds, if it doesn't, add a little water.  Dough should form a ball on top
of the blade. Allow to revolve 8 to 10 times.  If dough will not form a ball,
add a T. of flour and pulse motor.
4.   Stop machine.  Remove cover and feel dough.  If it feels wet add a T. of
flour and
rotate.  Feel dough again.  Replace cover and let dough rest 5 minutes.
5.   Turn on machine and rotate dough 30 times.  Remove to a floured surface.
  Dough should feel smooth, not sticky and quite firm.  (Do not overheat
dough; if it gets hot, turn machine off and allow to cool.)
6.   Let dough rest 2 minutes.  Knead vigorously 50 times, slapping dough on
counter.
7.   Put dough into a greased tub (a 6 qt. ice cream tub w/lid), cover and
let rise 60 minutes.
8.   Turn out onto floured board, knead vigorously, stretching dough into a
14" rectangle.  Fold long side to center, repeat making 3 layers.  Repeat
shaping and
folding (this stretches the gluten and redistributes any yeast remaining).
 Then fold into a ball and return to greased tub  (or bowl) for the long
rise,   at least 2 hours or until 2 1/2 to 3 times in size.
9.   Turn out onto floured surface, divide (opt) and shape into a round or
 long  loaf or into rolls.

	USE A BAKING STONE.    START PREHEATING OVEN TO 450 FOR AT      LEAST 30
MINUTES BEFORE BAKING.

10.  Rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours on cornmeal covered parchment paper on a baking
sheet.
11.  Brush tops of  loaves with 2 T. cornstarch cooked with 1 cup water
(cooled). (opt)
12.  Slash tops with a razor blade.
13.  Slide loaf on the parchment paper into preheated oven onto baking stone
and bake 30 minutes.  Pour 1 or 2 cups of water into a pan on the bottom of
oven to create steam.

Dough can be made in two batches and then combined for kneading and shaping.

Each recipe will make 2 baguettes or 2 round loaves or 12 rolls.

                    French Baguettes For A Crowd (R T)

Recipe By     :Rustic European Breads
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread Machine                   Bread-Bakers Mailing List
                Fatfree                         International Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast
  1 1/2              C  Water -- Room Temp,
  3 1/2              C  Bread Flour
  2                Tsp  Salt

Combine all ingredients in the bread machine pan and process on dough
setting until just mixed and kneaded.  Empty into large lightly greased bowl
and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Set aside in a warm place until
tripled in size, about 3 hours.  Remove plastic wrap and with wet hands
lightly punch the dough down.  Cover again with plastic wrap and allow to
rise again until doubled, about 1 hour.

Sift flour lightly over work surface and with floured hands turn the dough
out on the floured surface.  Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and let it
rest for 5 minutes.  Cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper or
lightly grease it.  Roll each piece of dough into a cylinder 17" long.  With
the side of your palm hit the cylinder all the way down the back to form a
crease.  Pinch the crease closed and taper the ends of the loaf.  Lay the
baguettes into the prepared baking sheet and leave at least 2 - 3" between
them.  Lightly mist the dough with water and cover loosely with plastic
wrap.  Place in a warm draft-free place to rise till the baguettes are 1 1/2
times their original size, 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  30 minutes before the estimated
baking time preheat the oven to 450 deg F.

Press the dough with one baguette lightly with your finger; if it feels
springy and not dried out and formed a crust, leave it alone, if you can
feel a dry crust, gently roll and turn the baguette over so that the soft
bottom crust is now on top.

Slash the baguettes diagonally with a razor or a sharp knife 3 times along
the length, making sure not to cut more then 1/2" deep.

Lightly mist the dough with water.  Place the baking sheet on the middle
rack of the preheated oven, quickly spray the oven floor several times and
shut the door.   Spray 3 more times every 3 minutes for a total of 4 sprays
in 9 minutes.    (What I did was to throw into the bottom of the oven 3 ice
cubes once at the beginning - Reggie)  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the
breads are nicely brown.  Remove immediately to a rack to cool for 2 hours.
This bread is best eaten the day it is made or frozen for later use.  To
reheat frozen bread place on a baking sheet in a preheated 375 deg F oven
for about 25 minutes, or until hot and crisp.

Makes three 17" baguettes...enough for a crowd.

These are absolutely excellent!!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  Water
  2          teaspoons  Olive Oil
     1/4           cup  Finely Chopped Onion
     1/3           cup  Sun-Dried Tomatoes -- snipped
                        -- Not Oil-Packed
  2             cloves  Garlic -- Minced, About 2 tsp
  1           teaspoon  Dried Rosemary -- Crushed
  3               cups  Bread Flour
  2          teaspoons  Sugar
  1           teaspoon  Salt
  2 1/4      teaspoons  Active Dry Yeast -- Or 1 Pkg Yeast

Use a bread machine that will make a 1 1/2 lb loaf.  Add ingredients in the
order suggested by the manufacturer and start the machine.  Or, prepare
bread following a conventional yeast rise method and bake as baguettes.

To bake the dough as baguettes, set the cycle to dough or manual.  When
machine signals, remove dough to lightly floured surface.  (Dough will be
slightly sticky.)  Punch down.  Divide into 2 - 4 equal portions.  Let rest
10 minutes.   Shape into two 15 inch or four 8 inch loaves.  Place on a
greased baking sheet.  Cover and let rise until nearly double (30 - 45
minutes).  Slash tops with a sharp knife.  Bake in a 375 deg F oven about 30
minutes or until bread sounds hollow, brushing twice with cold water during
baking.

Makes one 1 1/2 lb loaf or two or four baguettes. (20 servings)

I made this as a loaf in the bread machine and it has a wonderful aroma
while baking and tastes fabulous.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  lentils
  1 1/3           cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme -- crushed
     3/4           cup  skim milk
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           envelope  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water -- (110-115 degrees)
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached

Combine the lentils, water, rosemary and thyme in a saucepan and bring to a
boil.  Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 30 minutes, or until
lentils are tender but not mushy.  Drain and set aside. Pour the milk in a
saucepan and bring just to the boiling point. Stir in the sugar, salt, olive
oil and drained lentils. Set aside to cool slightly.

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and allow to stand for 3 minutes.  Add
it to the milk mixture, mix well and transfer to a large bowl. Add the wheat
flour and mix well. Stir in the all-purpose flour, mixing until the dough
can be formed into a ball. Put the dough ball on a floured surface and knead
until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Spray the bowl with a nonstick
cooking spray and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a
damp towel and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1
hour.  Punch the dough down and form into a loaf shape. Place in a standard
size loaf pan, which has been sprayed with a nonstick cooking spray. Cover
and allow to again double in size, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the bread in the preheated oven and
bake for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake, for 35
more minutes, or until the top is a golden brown and sounds hollow  when
tapped. Allow the bread to come to room temperature before slicing.

Makes 24 slices. Each slice contains approximately: 97calories, no
cholesterol, 1 gr. fat, 95 mg. sodium 3 gm. protein, 18 gm. carbohydrate.

The combination of lentils and wheat flour in this dense, hearty and
egg-free bread provides the legume and grain necessary for a complete
vegetarian protein. For this reason, it provides all the nutrients necessary
for a healthful snack all by itself.  For a lighter-textured bread you can
use all unbleached, all-purpose flour, and for a prettier bread you can
combine the all-white flour with pink lentils.  However, for fall menus I
like the coarse, heavy texture of this bread just the way the recipe is
written. I like it toasted and spread with honey or an all-fruit jam for
breakfast and for making sandwiches of all types. My favorite is a
vegetarian sandwich made with thinly sliced grilled vegetables and melted
cheese.  It also makes great croutons for soups and salads.

If you have any cooked left-over lentils in the refrigerator you can
substitute one cup of cooked as  lentils for the one-third cup of dried
lentils called for and eliminate cooking them. However, if you do that, add
the rosemary and thyme to the milk in step two.  Store this bread, tightly
wrapped, in the refrigerator.

  6                 kg  flour
  100               gr  yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2     tablespoon  salt
                        water

Mix the yeast with water, and let stand until bubbly. Add flour, then sugar
and salt. Mix and start adding water, until you get something like a
pancake batter. Cover and leave for 3 days.

Oil a skillet and heat it well (it should be very hot). Pour a little water
on the bottom to cool it a little, then return to heat (this is supposed to
help form the pores on top). Pour a little batter, spread evenly, and cook
over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. The bottom should turn brown, and the top
should look like a sponge. Don't turn over.

NOTES : Somebody asked for an Injera recipe; here's one I got a few years ago from
a newspaper here in Israel, and never tried it. Please let me know if it's
good.

The quantities in this recipe are for a medium-sized Ethiopian
restaurant... you should probably reduce it a little...

  1                cup  flour
                        -- or teff, or rice flour
     1/2           tsp  salt

                        water
                        yeast

Add enough water to make it the consistency of pancake batter. You can add a tiny pinch of yeast, although this may not be necessary, since there are probably enough microorganisms around to do the job. Cover the bowl and let it sit for two or three days. I leave it in the oven with the light on. It should get bubbly and sour.

 Heat a large (12 inch) fry pan over medium heat. Grease, or spray with non-stick stuff. Pour in some batter to cover the pan. It should cook in a few minutes. The top should be spongy with holes in it, but not wet. Don't turn over. If the top does not cook, the batter may be too thick. Add a little water. Put one on each plate and heap other food on top. Yum.

NOTES : It's great stuff - sort of an edible dinner plate, and wonderful for serving foods that have sauces, juices, or gravies. It seems like what we had in an Ethiopian restaurant a few years ago. My son, who is visiting right now, claims that his local Ethiopian restaurant uses rice flour or teff, rather than wheat flour.

  1                cup  BUCKWHEAT PANCAKE MIX
  1                cup  BISCUIT MIX
  1                     EGG
                        Add:
  1         tablespoon  OIL
  1 1/2           cups  WATER -- (1 1/2 to 2)
                        -- to obtain an easy pouring consistency.

 Bring a 10-inch skillet or a handled griddle pan to medium heat uniformly over the flame. Do not let the pan get too hot.

Spread 1/2 tsp. OIL over the pan with a brush.

Fill a measuring cup (with spout) or a large cream pitcher with batter.

Pour the mixture on the hot pan or griddle in a thin stream starting from the outside and going in circles to the center from left to right. As soon as it bubbles uniformly all over remove from heat. Pancakes should be 9 inches in diameter.

Place the pan in an oven at 325' for about 1 minute until the top is dry but not brown.

Arrange the five pancakes overlapping each other so as to completely cover a fifteen-inch tray, thus forming the Injera "tablecloth."

This unleavened bread of Ethiopia is really a huge pancake made by the women in special large pans with heavy covers. The Tef batter is saved from an earlier baking and added to the new batter to give it a sourdough quality. It is poured at a thin consistency and baked covered so that the bottom of the pancake does not brown. The top should be full of air holes before the pancake is covered. The heavy cover steams the pancake so that when it is finished it looks like a huge thin rubber sponge. Since Tef is not available here, we had to find a way to simulate Injera in our test kitchen. The combination of buckwheat flour mix and biscuit mix seems to produce the closest substitute. Making it is easy, but getting the Injera texture takes a bit of experimentation, first, because not all pancake mixes are alike and secondly, it is important to cook the pancake at just the right temperature. This takes a bit of practice.



                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Injera is made with a flour indiginous to Ethiopia.Tef is a type of millet flour.

When the batter is made, it is allowed to ferment for several days. It becomes soured. the batter is poured into a hot skillet and escaping gas bubbles rise to the surface making the bread pitted and pockmarked producing a bread with a soured but pleasant taste.

There have been a variety of recipes trying to imitate Injera as best as possible. I seen recipes using pancake mix, biscuit mix, beer, club soda and various flours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Dough:
  1           envelope  yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1              stick  butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  cardamom -- crushed
  6 1/2           cups  flour -- (6 1/2 to 7)
  2               cups  raisins
     1/2           cup  candied citron -- diced
                        -- Glaze:
                        Confectioners' sugar stirred with a
                        little water

Yield: 2 large loaves.  Can be frozen.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Proof the yeast in the lukewarm water with the teaspoon of sugar. Scald the milk, add the butter and stir until melted. Let stand until lukewarm, then add this mixture to the yeast sponge. Add the help cup of sugar, salt, eggs and cardamom, and stir until blended. Measure in the flour, cup by cup, until you have a dough stiff enough to knead. Stir in the raisins and the chopped citron. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until shiny. Place in a large buttered bowl, cover with a towel and let stand in a warm place to rise approximately 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Take the dough out and punch down a couple of times. Divide into 2 equal pieces and shape into loaves which you will place in 2 large (9" by 5") loaf pans that have been buttered. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Then bake in the oven for about 35 minutes or until light brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped with your finger. Cool in the baking pans. When completely cool, take the loaves out onto a piece of wax paper and spread the glaze on top.

============
This makes a nice holiday gift when formed into a circle before rising and baking, and then topped with red and green candied cherries.

     1/4           cup  warm water
  2 1/2      teaspoons  dry yeast -- or one packet
  4 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        ----
     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  canned pumpkin
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Makes 18 rolls.

To make sponge:  dissolve yeast in water in large heavy-duty mixer bowl.
Add 1/4 C flour and 1 Tbs sugar and mix in.  Cover with plastic and let rise
in warm place 45 mins, until very foamy.

When sponge is ready: bring milk and butter just to a simmer in pan on
stove--remove from heat and stir to melt butter.  Cool 10 mins.  Whisk in
pumpkin, syrup, eggs, salt, nutmeg, and remaining 1/4 C plus 1 Tbs sugar.

Whisk pumpkin mixture into sponge.

Using mixer with dough hook, mix in enough remaining flour, 1 C at a time,
to form dough.  Mix until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if sticky,
about 5 mins.

Cover bowl with plastic and a clean kitchen towel; let dough rise in warm
draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 30 mins.

Grease 2 heavy baking sheets.  Punch down dough.  Transfer to floured
surface and Knead until smooth.

Divide dough into 18 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into your favorite roll
shape (mine is bowknot!) and arrange on prepared sheets.  Cover and let rise
until doubled, about 45 mins.

Preheat oven to 425 deg F.  Bake rolls until golden brown, about 15 mins.
Transfer to racks and cool slightly.

Notes:

Be careful when baking--because of the syrup and sugar they will burn easily
if left too long in the oven.

These are a really pretty golden-orange color inside!

Yield: 1 large loaf

Follow bread machine manufacturer's instructions. For best results, use fresh
cilantro and thick, chunky salsa, draining any thin, watery liquid before
using.

NOTES:  I don't like cilantro, so I've either eliminated it altogether or
substituted  garlic (powder or fresh) which I love.  When I didn't have sour
cream, I've used 'tater topping products or cottage cheese.  When I ran out
of taco seasoning, I made up my own combination of chili powder, cumin,
garlic powder, salt and pepper.
substitute for taco seasoning.  I always have salsa, but occasionally I've
had to supplement it with a tablespoon of canned (drained) tomatoes or a bit
of chopped onion or green pepper.

                        Mozzarella Cheese -- Grated,***Note
                        Mint -- Or Cilantro, Basil
                        -- To Taste

*NOTE:  Original recipe used 1 T ... we reduced it.
**NOTE:  Can use more shrimp to your liking.  We used 3/4 lb and omitted the
mozzarella as Jeff doesn't deal well with lactose in cheese.  Shell, devein,
cook and dice shrimp.  Original recipe did NOT use the garlic cloves for the
topping.  I added it and it was really good with it.
***NOTE:  1 -  2 C, we left the mozzarella out completely and could really
taste the wonderful flavor of the shrimp and feta.

This was really incredible!! [Reggie]

If using chopped fresh mint, use 3 T or a scant 1/4 C.  This dough is superb
topped with any Greek or Middle Eastern topping.

Bread Machine Method:
Warm liquids to lukewarm, 110 deg F.  Add ingredients to your bread machine
in the order specified for your machine. Use the dough cycle, which will
knead the dough and allow it to rise on time.  It is not necessary to let
the dough rise any longer than 1 hr.  If your machine has a double kneading
dough cycle, remove the dough after an hour or so and turn off your machine.
Allowing the dough to knead the second time causes bubbles that are
difficult to roll.  Either active dry or rapid rise yeast can be used.  It
is not necessary to proof the yeast in water; just mix it in with the flour.

Food Processor Method:
Warm liquids to lukewarm., 110 deg F.  Combine all dry ingredients
(including yeast) in a food processor bowl (steel blade) and process for 10
seconds.  Either active dry or rapid rise yeast can be used.  It is not
necessary to proof the yeast in water; just mix it in with the flour.  Pour
the oil and remaining liquid ingredients through the feeding tube until the
dough forms a ball.  If the dough is sticky, add flour a tablespoon at a
time until the dough is not sticky.  Process dough into a ball, place it in
a greased bowl and cover with a kitchen towel.  Place the bowl in a warm,
draft-free location for 50 - 60 minutes.

Heavy-duty Mixer with Dough Hook Method:
Prepare dough as you would for a food processor.  Allow to knead for about 5
minutes.  Add just enough flour to cause the dough to cling to the dough
hook.  Allow the dough to rise and in food processor instructions.

By Hand Method:
If using a quick or rapid rise yeast, mix it with the flour.  There is no
need to proof it.  If using active dry yeast, place 1/4 - 1/3 of the warm
water in a large bowl and sprinkle a pinch of sugar and the yeast into the
water.  Stir until dissolved and let sit in a warm, draft-free location for
5 minutes.  Add remaining water (liquid) and oil and stir well.  Add all
remaining ingredients and stir together until you can no longer work the
dough with a spoon.  Turn out on a lightly floured counter.  Pat the dough
into a ball and flatten it slightly.  Fold the dough over, and using the
heels of your hands, push the dough away from you with a rolling motion.
Rotate the dough one quarter each time you repeat the process.  Continue
kneading the dough for 5 - 10  minutes.  Place the dough in a large greased
bowl and cover it with a clean towel.  Place it in a warm draft-free
location (such as an oven or microwave) and let rise for 50 - 60 minutes.

Preheat oven to 475 deg F for at least 30 minutes if using a pan and from 30
minutes - 1 hr if using a stone.

Grease the pizza pan with olive oil or spray it with nonstick vegetable
spray.  If using a peel and stone, dust the peel with cornmeal to prevent
the dough from sticking so that you can easily slide it off the peel and
onto the stone.  Or cut a parchment paper circle slightly larger than your
pizza, put the paper on the peel and make your pizza on the paper.  You will
slide pizza and paper onto the stone.

After the dough has risen once, divide it in half, roll it out on a lightly
floured or cornmeal countertop or hand stretch the dough into a circle.
Pick up the dough and turn it over and roll or stretch from the center
outwards until a circle is formed.  Dust the dough with either flour or
cornmeal, only as needed to prevent sticking.  The thinner the dough the
thinner the crust.  A thinly rolled dough that does not rise a second time
(after rolling) will give the thinnest crispiest crust.  Lay the dough on
your prepared pan or peel.  Pull the dough up around the edges of the pan so
a slight lip is formed, and crimp the edges.

For a thin crisp crust top and bake immediately.  For a thicker chewier
crust allow to rise for 15 to 30 minutes.  The longer the rise the thicker
the dough.  Top after rising and then bake.  Place toppings to leave 1/4 -
1/2" border to prevent spillage and provide a crust to hold while eating.
Bake on the bottom rack of the oven or directly on the pizza stone until
golden brown, 5 - 10 minutes.

Makes one (15") or two (10") pizzas

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Warm Water -- 110@F
  1         tablespoon  Sugar -- Granulated
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast -- (! envelope)
  3               cups  Bread Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Salt
  2        tablespoons  Shortening
                        Sesame Seeds

Makes 1 loaf...

425@F --> 375@F

Combine Water and Sugar in a 2 C. Measuring Cup and stir in the Yeast. Be sure all the yeast is in the water and not stuck to the spoon. Let rest in a warm location until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Combine 3 C. Flour, Salt, and Shortening and pulse 4-5 times to distribute evenly. Add Yeast-Water. Process about 5 seconds to JUST form a ball. Dough should be smooth and satiny. If too dry, add water 1 T. at a time and pulse to blend.  If too sticky, add more flour 1 T. at a time. Process 20 seconds to knead. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to it, turning to oil all sides. Let rise in a warm place 1 1/2 hrs (until doubled).

Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured board. Form into a flat, round, single loaf about 10" in diameter. Place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with Sesame Seeds and press into the loaf. Cover loosely with Plastic Wrap and allow to rise in a warm place 1 hr, until almost doubled.

Place rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425@F. Add loaf and bake for 10 minutes, then reduce to 375@F and continue baking 25 minutes. It's done when it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Cool COMPLETELY before slicing. Slice horizontally.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  self-rising flour
  2        tablespoons  plain yogurt
                        -- preferably with active cultures
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        -- or flaked sea salt
                        about 1/2 c. lukewarm water -- (95F to 105F)

Makes 8 naan

Combine the flour, yogurt, and salt in a large bowl.  Add the lukewarm
water, 1 tablespoon at a time, working it into the flour mixture with
your fingers and bringing the flakes of dough together.  Add just
enough water to make a soft, slightly sticky dough.

Knead the dough roughly in the bowl for a couple of seconds, then cover
with a damp dish towel and let stand in a warm spot so the dough
ferments, about 1 hour.  During the last 15 minutes of standing time,
heat the broiler and broiler pan.

Flour your fingers and pull off a piece of dough about the size of a
walnut.  Between your palms, form the dough into a ball, then roll it
out with a rolling pin on an unfloured work surface into an oval 8 to 9
inches long and about 1/3 inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining dough
to make eight naan.

Put one naan on the hot broiler pan and broil about 3 to 4 inches from
the source of heat, until it puffs up and is speckled with brown spots.
 Naan cook very quickly, in about 30 seconds, so watch it constantly.
Turn over and cook the second side.  Repeat with the remaining seven naan.

The book has a pictures of a woman doing all the steps----making it
look very easy!  I have not tried this recipe, so I would like some
feedback as to whether it is authentic.

NOTE: I just bought Donna German's book THE BEST PIZZA IS MADE  AT HOME and discovered her "secret" for  Sicilian pizza dough.  Evidently the difference in deep dish pizzas like the Sicilians  is that they contain  some sugar and a higher proportion of
oil. Donna's recipe for the dough is simple.I made this for  supper and did the dough in my bread machine on the "dough"  cycle. It was made in my largest old iron skillet  which I'd sprayed with olive oil Pam. After I took it from the ABM, I  made the dough into a circle by trying to imitate those expert pizza chefs who fling the  dough around. Mine didn't get flung too high but it  worked! I spread it in the skillet and brought up the  extra dough to form a lip around the edge, then put  the pan to rise for 30 minutes while preheating the  oven to 475F. Bake the crust for 5 minutes by  itself--but before you do that, prick it well with a fork all over. Before you add toppings, drizzle olive oil on the crust and spread it around with a brush. Toppings are up to you--but I used (in this order) 1 cup mozzarella/cheddar cheese(grated), 2 cloves garlic  (crushed), 1 cup slightly cooked fresh broccoli  florets, a large sliced tomato, shredded fresh basil and feta cheese to
top. It was VERY good! This makes a  thick crust but it's so good there was none left to give to the birds! I hope Maria who first requested a Sicilian dough finds this--because I'd like to be able  to share more of the goodies from this book with
her!   There are thin pizza doughs as well--and all kinds of  toppings.

                             Pizzettas (R T)

Recipe By     :Polenta  by Brigit Legere Binns
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Low Fat
                Pizza And Calzones

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Pizza Dough:
     2/3           cup  Warm Water -- (about 110 Deg F)
     1/2      teaspoon  Sugar
  1           teaspoon  Active Dry Yeast
  2               cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  Polenta
                        -- or Coarsely Ground Cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  Whole-Wheat Flour
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary -- finely chopped
                        -- Or 1 Tsp Dried
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Extra Virgin Olive Oil -- *Note Plus
  2        tablespoons  water
  1           teaspoon  sea salt

*NOTE:  The original recipe used 2 T olive oil but I decreased it and added
the additional water which was not called for in the recipe.

To Make The Dough:
In a glass measuring cup with a lip, combine the water and the sugar and
stir to mix.  Sprinkle the yeast over the top and allow to stand for 10
minutes until it has a frothy head.  If no frothy head forms, the yeast is
bad and you will need to start again.

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with  the metal blade, combine the
all-purpose flour with the polenta, whole wheat flour, rosemary, olive oil,
and salt.  Process briefly just to blend.  With the motor running, pour the
yeast mixture steadily through the feed tube and process until the mixture
forms a rough ball on the central stem.  If the dough has not formed a ball
within 20 seconds, remove the cover and sprinkle a tablespoon (or more) of
water over the dough, then process again.  The dough should be processed for
a total time of about 45 seconds.  Replace the feed tube cover so that no
air will get in (I also covered the food processor with a towel to maintain
the heat ... I had the air conditioner on all day so it was cool in my
house) and leave the dough in the processor to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or
until it has doubled, puffed, and softened.

While the dough is rising, prepare any toppings you want to use.  I used
rehydrated porcini mushrooms, sauted sweet onions with poppy seeds and
toasted sesame seeds, sliced fresh Italian plum tomatoes, caponata, green
bell peppers, and capers.  I just matched whichever I wanted onto each of
the pizzas.

If you need to hold the dough for baking later...just form the individual
pizzas (without topping them)  and put them onto a refrigerator on nonstick
cookie sheets for up to 2 hours.  They do not need to be reheated when you
take them out of the refrigerator and put the topping on them.

Preheat the oven to 450 deg F on the middle shelf.  I put in my baking stone.

Process the dough in the food processor again for 5 seconds, then turn it
out onto a lightly floured board.  Work the dough together to into 8 to
10 equal-sized balls. (I made 5 individual pizzas with the dough...as I
wanted them to be a bit large to hold the fillings I had chosen.)   Place
the dough balls on a lightly oiled large baking sheet, covered with a
slightly dampened towel, and allow to rest for 15 minutes.  Press each ball
out into a 3 inch round.  Put the toppings on and leave a 1/4-inch border
around the edge.

Bake for 10 - 12 minutes.

These were wonderful!!

     1/4           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115F)
  1                cup  milk -- scalded, then cooled

  5 1/2           cups  flour -- (5 1/2 to 6)
  1                     egg

Makes 2 loaves

Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in milk, 3/4 cup sugar,
salt, 3 eggs, margarine and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in
enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto
lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Place in greased bowl. Turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm
place until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains
when touched.) Punch down dough and divide into halves. Shape each half
into round, slightly flat loaf. Place each loaf in greased round
9x1 1/2-inch layer cake pan. Cover and let rise until double, about 1 hour.
Heat oven to 350F. Beat 1 egg slightly and brush over loaves. Sprinkle with 1
teaspoon sugar. Bake until loaves are golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.

SNAIL LOAVES (CARACOIS): After dividing dough into halves, roll each half
into a rope about 25x1 1/2-inches. Coil each to form a snail shape in
greased round 9-inch layer cake pan. Proceed as directed.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          envelopes  yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water -- approximately 105
                        degrees
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3                     eggs -- well beaten
  6               cups  bread flour -- sifted

Heat oven to 200 degrees.  Place an oblong pan filled with water in the oven. (Omit this step if you have a gas stove.)  Fill metal mixing bowl with very hot water and set aside.

Combine milk and butter in glass bowl and microwave for 1 minute on high until milk mixture is about 105 degrees.  Add sugar and salt.  Empty mixing bowl.  In warmed mixing bowl, mix yeast, 1/4 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Allow to get foamy (approximately 2 minutes).  On low, beat in milk mixture and then eggs.  With beater on medium add flour one cup at a time making sure that mixture is smooth after each cup until dough is stiff (about 5 cups).  Remove dough from bowl and place on well floured surface.  Knead dough 15 to 20 minutes adding flour as you go until dough is no longer sticky. Drape cloth over dough and let rest.

Shut off oven.  Liberally grease a large bowl twice the size of your dough.  Place dough in bowl, turning the dough so that it becomes greased on all sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and towel. Place bowl in middle of oven over pan of water and let rise.  If you have used fast acting yeast, let the dough rise for 1 hour. If you have used regular yeast, let the dough rise for 2 hours.

Grease two 8 or 9 inch round cake pans.  Remove bowl from oven. Grease hands and remove dough from bowl onto lightly floured surface.  (For those of us that have loose fitting wedding rings, this is a good time to remove them.  It is awfully embarrassing to have to tear through every loaf of bread searching for your rings.)  Punch down dough and with a rolling pin lightly roll out dough to get the air out.  Form dough into 2 loaves and put into greased pans once again rolling the dough around to grease it on all sides.  At this point you can press in the optional hard cooked eggs into top of loaves.

Cover loaves with plastic wrap and towel and return to oven to let rise for 1  more hour.

Remove dough from oven.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove towel and plastic wrap and bake loaves for 20 minutes.  Your final product should be golden brown on top and lightly brown on bottom.  Rub a stick of butter or margarine on top to lightly cover.  Let bread cool out of pans on wire wrack for 2 hours. This bread freezes nicely and when stale makes delicious french toast and bread pudding.

NOTES : At last report, Irene is sending out somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 loaves of this bread each Christmas.  As we all know this is a delicious remembrance of our family and our history.

I hope the holidays find you all happy and healthy.  This bread is an old family recipe of my Vovo's (my Portuguese grandmother) and my mother makes this every year for friends and family.  As my father is also on this list he will get a kick out of this as well.  I hope you all enjoy this bread.  It is my absolute favorite bread in the world.  BTW, if someone manages to adapt this successfully to the bread machine (I have tried and not been happy) please let me know.

     1/4           cup  water -- hot
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads -- crushed
     1/2           cup  1% milk -- *NOTE
     1/4           cup  sugar -- **NOTE
  2        Tablespoons  margarine, imitation -- ***NOTE
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1              large  egg
  1         Tablespoon  yeast -- +2 teaspoon
  3               cups  All-Purpose Flour -- unbleached
                        King Arthur -- to 3 1/4 cups
                        TOPPING:
  1              large  egg white -- beaten lightly
  1           teaspoon  water
                        pearl sugar


*Original recipe called for whole milk.
**Original recipe called for 1/3 cup sugar.
***Original recipe called for butter.

 Combine the hot water and saffron, and let sit for 10 minutes to soften
the saffron. In a mixing bowl, beat together the saffron water, milk, sugar,
butter, salt, egg, yeast, 2 cups of the flour. Add enough of the remaining
flour to make a soft dough. Knead the dough (for about 15 minutes by hand,
12 minutes in an electric mixer, 90 seconds in a food processor, or in your
bread machine using the dough cycle), then set it aside to rise till puffy
(but not necessarily doubled in bulk), about 2 hours.
   Punch the dough down, and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Divide
the dough  into 16 pieces, and shape each piece into a ball. Place the balls
fairly close together (but not touching) in a 12-inch deep -dish pizza pan
or 9 x 13-inch pan, cover them, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until
they're puffy.
   Glaze the buns with the mixture of  beaten egg white and water, then
sprinkle them heavily with pearl sugar. Bake them in a preheated 375 degrees
F oven for 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown. ( watch them closely
at the end; because of their high sugar content, they tend to brown
quickly.) Serve with butter or Devon cream. Yield: 16 buns.

                        Levain:
                        chef
                        -- or 1/4 cup sourdough starter
     1/4           cup  unchlorinated water -- warm
                        Finish the Levain:
                        levain starter from above
     1/2           cup  unchlorinated water -- warm
  1 1/2           cups  bread flour
                        Dough:
                        levain from above
     3/4           cup  unchlorinated water -- warm
  2          teaspoons  pickling salt -- or kosher salt
  2               cups  bread flour

I have recently learned how to make a bread that is the peer of the very best SF sourdoughs, and far better than the big bakery versions. You will need a good starter. The dried SF starters are OK as a beginning. The starter I am currently using has evolved from a mixing together of a commercial SF starter and a hand-me-down Amish starter. You will find that no matter what you start with, your starter will become unique after a few months of use as it picks up new microorganisms from your kitchen and old ones die off or hybridize, exchange dna and all that good stuff.

This bread takes in the range of 36-48 hours to make, but most of that time it is doing things by itself. The actual baker input is perhaps 20-25 minutes. I make this entirely by hand.

yield: one two-pound loaf or two one-pound loaves

First you need to make a 'levain' which is the basic sourdough mixture.  To make a levain you need a 'chef' which is a piece of leftover dough from the previous batch of levain. The first time you will need a bit of sourdough starter from someone else.

1) start the levain: chef (1/4 C) or any sort of sourdough starter, including dried commercial ones. 1/4 C warm unchlorinated water (bottled water or water drawn hot from the tap and let sit overnight will do) 1/2 C bread flour (hard winter wheat type - NOT all purpose)

Soften the chef in the water in a mixing bowl, cutting into tiny lumps with a pair of table knives.  Cut with a knife in each hand with sort of a scissors motion. Add flour and mix with a fork to form a stiff dough.  This is step one of levain making. Leave levain in bowl, cover with some plastic wrap and let work in a warm place for 5-6 hours or until doubled.

2) finish the levain:
levain start from above
1/2 C warm unchlorinated water
1 1/2 C bread flour

Add water to the levain start,  and use the two table knives to cut the levain starter into little pieces.  Add 1/2 C of the flour and stir until fairly smooth. Add the remaining flour, knead the dough on a floured surface (or in the bowl) for several minutes until the lumps are gone, return to the bowl, cover with the plastic wrap and let rise 3-5 hours or until doubled.

NOTE: Step 2 rising can be done overnight in the refrigerator if desired.

Punch down the risen levain, and remove 1/4 cup as your chef for next time.  Wrap the chef in plastic wrap and let ferment at room temperature for an hour or two (until it shows a few bubbles) before putting in refrigerator.  I always have two chefs in the refrig to start a new batch of bread, using the older one first. They keep for many weeks.

3) making the dough:
levain from above
3/4 C warm unchlorinated water
2 t pickling salt or kosher salt
2 C bread flour

Chop the levain into pieces with the pair of dinner knives and mix with the water, stirring to start it dissolving. Add salt and 1 1/2 C of the flour, and mix. Knead the bread on a floured surface, working in the rest of the flour. The dough should be smooth and satiny when you are finished. Don't skimp on the kneading at this stage. I usually knead for at least 15 minutes. The actual amount of flour needed depends on the humidity, and may be less in dry indoor winter humidity. Return to bowl, cover with towel and let rise for 8-10 hours.

NOTE: This step 3 rising can be done in the refrigerator overnight if you wish instead of doing that in step 2.

4) final rising of loaves:

Gently cut into two pieces to make two 1 pound loaves or leave in one piece for a crowd-sized loaf. Form into round loaves (loaf) by patting inward from the lower sides with both hands. Place loaves (loaf) gently on a bread peel generously coated with cornmeal. Dust tops lightly with flour from a sifter, cover with a dry, floured towel, then plastic. Let rise until loaves are doubled. Slash top surface with a razor blade - a wallpaperer's knife with the break off ends works great too. Let loaves rest about 5-10 minutes after slashing.  Slide off peel onto a baking stone in a 450 degree oven for about 25 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when thumped on the bottom and are golden brown.   The crust will be crisper if you have a pan of hot water on the lowest rack in the oven to generate steam. You can also use a spray bottle to squirt water into the hot oven. San Francisco sourdough is generally less crispy than traditional French pain au levain, so I generally don't bother with the water r.

Let cool on wire rack when done.

I usually do step 2 rising in the refrig all night. Alternately you can do step 3 rising in the refrig. If you do, it will take a bit longer for the loaves to rise, because they are cold to start with. You will have to try a few loaves to get your timing down right for your kitchen. Even the 'imperfect' loaves will taste good, so eat them as you try the next round of baking. Also, the length of the rising steps affects the sourness of the final product, and you can adjust to find what is just right for you and the sourdough culture that you are using.

I suppose the loaves could rise on a cookie sheet rather than a bakers peel, but I've never tried that. I think the baking stone is important, but who knows? As for times, you'll have to experiment a bit. Of course amounts of flour are iffy too, depending on the humidity where the flour is stored.

If you don't eat the bread right away, store it in a freezer. With no20 preservatives it doesn't keep freshness too well otherwise. I often underbake the bread to a brown-and-serve stage, freeze, then finish baking a short time before serving.
I think you will be amazed how good this bread is once you try it a few times and get a feel for the steps. I have received glowing compliments from many French and French-Canadians who at first refused to believe that I did not buy the bread flown in from Paris. This bread makes the products from Colombo, Parisian and the like seem like amateurish attempts. Make this stuff for guests and you will be a breadmaking legend in your own time.

                Sourdough Breads                Starter

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  starter
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1                cup  water -- tepid

This must be made about 12 hours before you are going to begin the
bread-making or roll process. Just do it at night before you go to bed. It
takes only a minute. Remove the starter from the refrigerator and allow it
to come to room temperature. Measure out 1 1/2 cups  of starter and put it
into a 2 quart mixing bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 cup tepid water. Mix
this well, cover, and allow to sit overnight, unrefrigerated. This is called
" proofing ", and when the batter is ready, the natural yeast will have
spread throughout the dough and it will be bubbly and offer a strong
sourdough odor . When ready to bake, measure out the amount of batter called
for in the recipe and  return the remaining batter to to your starter bowl
in the refrigerator. Remember that you must  replenish your starter  by
adding back what you take out. Return the same amount of water and flour
that you have removed. Just whip it up and stir it into the starter bowl.

  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt

Sourdough English Muffins which also can be made as burger buns, and which don't even have to be sourdough - what more could you ask?

Yield: 8-10 muffins/buns

Mix the flour and liquid mixture with a fork, cover with plastic wrap and let sit overnight in a warm place.

Then slowly mix in up to a cup of flour. Start with a third to a half cup, and mix in the bowl until the dough is free from the bowl and has lost much of its stickiness. Then knead in more flour on a floured surface, kneading for about 10-15 minutes to get a smooth, silky, elastic dough. Knead in only enough flour to control stickiness, which will vary with seasonal dry/wet cycles.

Divide dough into 8-10 equal portions, roll between your hands to make balls. 8 portions will make nice large-sized burger buns. 9-10 portions will make standard English muffin sizes or smaller buns. Place muffins/buns on a cookie sheet well covered with corn meal, allowing some space between them so they don't touch after rising. Cover with a floured towel, then a sheet of plastic, and let rise until they are about doubled in thickness. This will take several hours, depending on how warm the room is.

For English muffins: When risen, use a pancake turner to carefully lift muffins from the cookie sheet and place cornmeal side down onto a moderate heat frying pan or griddle (seasoned cast iron is great here). Turn the muffins frequently to prevent burning. They should be cooked only until light brown, because they will be toasted later.

For hamburger buns:

When risen, place cookie sheet with risen buns into a 400 degree oven on top of a baking stone slab. The slab is not absolutely necessary, and if you don't have one use the upper oven rack with a piece of foil partly shielding the underside of the cookie sheet from the direct heat of the lower burner on the lower rack. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. If you like a lighter bun, make 10 portions, and let them rise a bit longer.

  6                  c  all-purpose flour -- more if needed
  4 1/2            tsp  yeast
  1               tbsp  sugar
  1               tbsp  salt
  1                  c  water -- very warm (120F)

                        yellow cornmeal
  1                     egg white

Feed your starter at least 12 hours before making bread.

Combine 2 1/2 cups of the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add water, oil and starter and beat 3 minutes with an electric mixer.

Work in additional flour by hand until dough can be handled. Amount will vary, depending on consistency of starter used. Decant dough to a lightly floured board and knead until smooth, satiny and elastic, about 10 minutes,working in additional flour in small amounts as needed to keep dough from sticking to board or hands.

Place in a large, oiled bowl, turning once to coat dough ball; cooking spray works well for this. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Punch dough down and divide into either 2 or 4 pieces, depending on size of loaves desired. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

Roll each piece out into a rectangle and roll up from long side, pinching seam closed and tapering ends. Place loaves, seam side down,  either in baguette pans or on a baking sheet which has been oiled and sprinkled with cornmeal.  Gash top 1/4 inch deep either along the length or diagonally every 2 or 3 inches. Beat egg white with 1 tbsp water until frothy and brush loaves with it. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Bake at 375F 20 minutes,  then brush again with egg white and bake an additional 20 minutes.

Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.

Make your batter the night before. Cover and let it sit out. Dissolve the
yeast in the water. Mix with the sourdough batter and then stir in the sugar
and salt , and  the green chile peppers. Finally, stir in the flour. I use
my Kitchen Aid dough hook so there is no pain to this method. Knead with a
machine or by hand until the dough is very smooth and elastic. Place the
dough on a plastic tabletop and cover with a large metal bowl. Allow to
double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down, knead it a bit, and
then shape into 24 small rolls. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about
15 minutes or until golden brown.

This recipe  makes 2 loaves of bread or you could make one loaf of bread and
12 rolls.

  2               cups  bread flour
  1                cup  mashed potatoes -- plain & warm

     1/3           cup  sugar
  6 1/2           cups  bread flour -- (6 1/2 to 8 1/2)

Combine the first four ingredients in a large non metallic bowl and blend well. Cover and  let rise until light and bubbly, overnight in a cool kitchen or several hours in a warm kitchen. This is a must do step! Stir down this " sponge" ( light bubbly batter ) and add the 3/4 cup warm water, salt, oil, sugar and half the flour ( start with 3+ cups ) and mix well. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour until you create a soft pliable, non sticky dough, kneading to this consistency and only adding more flour as needed to prevent stickiness. Dough should be soft and smooth  yet pliable.

Then place dough in an oiled bowl, turn to coat, cover and let rise double in a warm place ( about 2 hours ). Punch down dough with floured hands and cut dough in half. Let rest 10 minutes on the counter. Shape into loaves and place into 2 greased  9 x 5x 3 inch loaf pans. Cover and let rise to top of bread pans or light. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for about 45 mins or until golden and done. remove from pan to finish cooling on racks. Yield 2 loaves.

NOTE: notice, there is no yeast in the recipe. The active sourdough starter is all that you need. Also the " sponge" method is used. That is, starter is added to  ( or yeast mixture in a non sourdough recipe ) part of the flour mixture and thus is fully activated. So when the remaining flour and ingredients are added, the dough has a head start so to speak, and the dough can rise successfully and light.

P.S. some people add yeast to their sourdough recipes to insure lightness and rising. This is all a matter of perspective on sourdough recipes and techniques. My philosophy has always been very open minded on bread making. Bake stuff the way you like it! :)

Sourdough Starter

In a non-reactive container (I use a quart-size  plastic peanut butter or
mayonnaise jar with a plastic lid) mix together 1 1/2 cups water, 1 1/2
cups flour and 2 tsp yeast.  Let set at room temperature for about 5
days, stirring gently each day.  It will have a nice (to me) yeasty,
beery aroma.  After 5 days, if you aren't going to use it, screw the cap
on and refrigerate.

When ready to use, about 12 hours before you use it, add 1 cup each of
water and flour.  It will foam up quite nicely and after the 12 hours or
so, take out the amount you need for the recipe and close the lid on the
rest and refrigerate.

The next time you are ready to make a sourdough recipe, just take it out,
add the appropriate amount of water and flour at a 1:1 ration and let set
12 hours at room temp.  If I go more than 2 or 3 weeks without using the
starter (rare indeed), I take it out and feed it anyway and then feed the
excess to my 2 coon hounds.  [The coon hounds are ~not~ necessary to the
recipe ::)) ].

I have on occasion been in a hurry to make a sourdough something or other, and
then I would use very warm water (100F) when I fed the starter; it was usually
ready in 4 to 6 hours then. [You can tell; it will be nice and foamy; sometimes
after a full 12 hours, the foam will have subsided a bit, but it is still ready
to use - I stir the foam down anyway]

There are many variations in sourdough starters; I have one from the WWW
Sourdough Site that is similar to the above, but also uses a couple of
tbs each of sugar and vinegar.  I keep it going too.

= = = = =

This makes a very good starter and I use it frequently; as a matter of fact my
jar is sitting on the counter right now ready to use.  I fed it last night
around 9PM and am about to make Sunday morning hotcakes with it.

Heres how to make sprouts. About 2-3 days (depending on temperature) before you
want to bake your bread  soak 1/2 cup wheat berries in cold water overnight.
Use a jar covered with cheesecloth or sprouting jar.  In the morning drain.
Rinse and drain at least 2 times a day or more until "tails" appear.  Tails can
be between 1/8-1/4 inch long.  Wheat berry sprouts should be no longer than the
berry itself.

dough is sticky, knead in more flour.

Place dough in a buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in
a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.
Punch down and cut dough into two parts.  Roll each part into a 12 x 8
inch rectangle.  Brush with the melted butter, then fold one long edge
to the center.  Fold the other long edge to the center, overlapping by 1
inch.  Turn over, taper the ends, and place on a parchment-lined baking
sheet.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again in a warm place for 1

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  flour -- (5 to 6)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2           packages  yeast
     1/3           cup  nonfat dry milk
  1 1/3           cups  hot water
     1/4           cup  vegetable shortening
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  candied fruits
  1                cup  raisins
                        Topping:
  1                cup  confectioner's sugar -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- (1 to 1 1/2)
  12                    candied cherries -- red
  1            slivers  candied cherries -- green
  6                     walnut halves

To get the proper rise and shape, you have to use the proper pan - Bernard
Clayton in his Complete Book of Breads states that you must determine the total
amount of dough by either weight or volume and then use the following:

 PAN   SIZE   VOLUME  WEIGHT

Large   9 x 5 x 3     3 cups      2 lbs

Medium  8 x 4 x 2    2 1/2 cups     1.5 lbs

Small   7 x 3 x 2    1 1/2 cups     1 lbs

Mini   5 x 3 x 2    3/4 cups  1/2 lbs

sub-mini   4 x 2 x 1   1/2 cup   5-6 oz

Makes one large and six babies [to give away!]

Combine 2 cups of flour and all but the fruit in a bowl and beat with a wooden
spoon or in mixer for 2 minutes.  Add the rest of the flour slowly until it
cleans the sides of the bowl.  Knead for 10 minutes, occasionally throwing it
down hard to break bubbles.  Let it rise at room temp in a greased bowl covered
with plastic wrap for approx. 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.  Divide
into two and knead briefly.  Make one large round loaf and place on a baking
sheet and cover with wax paper.  Make six small loaves and place in muffin tins
[dough should nearly reach top of tin] and cover with wax paper - let rise
until doubled, about an hour.  Preheat for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Bake the
large loaf 35 minutes or until golden and the muffin loaves 20 minutes [you all
know the thumping trick] - remove to rack to cool and frost, decorating the
large with the fruits and the small with a walnut half each -

     1/2         pound  margarine -- ( 2 sticks )

  1 1/4           cups  milk

  2                pkg  active dry yeast

  4                     egg yolks
  2              whole  eggs
  1                tsp  ground cardamom
                        Additional melted margarine
                        Frosting:
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  cream
  1                tsp  almond extract
                        additional cream if needed to thin for
                        icing consistency

yield: 4 loaves

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water until foamy. Heat milk, margarine,
sugar and salt to melt margarine. Cool mixture to warm. Then add the yeast
mixture, yolks and eggs.Mix well. Transfer to large bowl. Gradually
beat in 6 cups of flour by hand with cardamom to form a dough. If needed,
add enough additional flour to make a smooth and elastic dough, kneading
to such consistency. Place dough in a large oiled bowl, turn to coat and cover
bowl.PLACE IN REFRIGERATOR OVERNIGHT. This overnight chilling is necessary
to produce the lovely texture of this bread.The yeast grows slowly and has
plenty of sugar for food; so dont worry about the yeast!

The next morning divide the dough as desired, shaping for loaves, rolls or
braids.The recipe should make 4 loaves or braids.The size depends on
how you portion out the dough.
For loaves place dough into bread pans. For braids, braid as you would
for 3 strand egg or challah bread placing on baking sheets. Brush top of dough
lightly with some melted margarine. Lighly cover and let rise puffy/
double in a warm place. Bake in a preheated 350 oven 20 to 30 minutes or done
& golden. When done, carefully remove bread from pans, or braids to cooling
rack. When warm ( not hot ) glaze by combining the icing ingredients and
drizzle over bread or braids. Freezes well.

                        Buttery Dinner Rolls dough -- see recipe
                        Filling:
  2               Tbsp  butter -- softened
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
  2                tsp  cinnamon -- approx.
     3/4           cup  ground nuts -- I use walnuts
                        Icing:
  1                cup  powdered sugar
     1/2           tsp  almond extract
     1/2           tsp  vanilla extract
     1/2           tsp  butter -- softened or melted
  1                tsp  milk -- added a bit at a
                        time (1 to 2)

Make same dough as Buttery Dinner Rolls, through first rise.

On a lightly floured surface, roll and stretch the dough out to a
13 by 20 inch rectangle.  Spread butter over dough, using a knife
and/or a stiff basting brush.  Sprinkle with cinnamon FIRST, then
brown sugar and nuts.  Try to spread filling right to the short
ends.  Beginning at the long side, roll up jelly-roll style as
many turns as possible.  Pinch the long edge of the dough into
the roll.

Shape into a circular ring on a greased pizza pan or cookie
sheet.  If filling doesn't come right to the end of the roll,
consider snipping off a bit of the end with a pair of scissors.
Join the ends of the roll, using a bit of water.  With scissors,
make cuts along the outside edge 1/2 to 3/4 way through the ring
at 1 to 1-1/2 inch intervals.  Turn each section on its side (at
a slant).  Can be covered and refrigerated at this point to hold.

Cover and let rise until doubled, 30 minutes or more.  Preheat
oven to 375 F.  When ring goes in the oven, turn down to 350 F.
Bake 20 to 30 minutes at 350 F.

Mix icing until smooth and the consistency of heavy cream.
Drizzle on the hot Tea Ring with a teaspoon.

Note:  Can cut red and/or green maraschino cherries in half and
place one half on each section of the ring -- a nice Christmas
touch.

By Madge Rosenberg

Left over bread makes a slightly sweet and spicy stuffing for chicken.

Add all ingredients except the raisins in the order suggested by your bread
machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.

Add the raisins at the beeper or at the end of the first kneading in
machines without a beeper to signal addition of fruit and nuts.

This is very tasty.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               Cups  All-Purpose Flour
  1           Teaspoon  Salt
  2        Tablespoons  Shortening
  8        Tablespoons  Dry Milk Powder
  1             Medium  Egg -- Slightly Beaten
     1/2           Cup  Sugar
  12            Ounces  Water
  2 1/2      Teaspoons  Active Dry Yeast -- *

Add to the bread machine in order preferred by your machine. (In mine, start
with the flour and add dry ingredients first). Yeast should be placed in the
yeast dispenser. **note! If you use Fleischmann's yeast, increase the amount
by 1 teaspoonful!  Run this on your Dough cycle. After completion they can
be finished one of several ways. One is to take a pinch of dough about the
size of a small egg, pull, dip in melted butter, run through sugar/cinnamon
mixture and then tie them in a knot.

 Another method is to roll out to about the size of a cookie sheet, spread
butter (slightly LESS than a stick) over surface, then top with
sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll and slice about 1/2 inch thickness. You should
get enough for about 3 9" round or sq. pans. I cover the bottom of pans
lightly with melted butter--just a small amount! Allow room for them to
double in size!  Place in a proofing oven (turn on oven set to 250 for 2
mins then TURN OFF and place rolls in off oven). Let rise till very light
and double in bulk (will take about 1 1/2 hrs). Can cover with greased waxed
paper.
(Do not use towels as they stick!!) Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees
for about 20 mins. Remove from pan at once.

 Can be frozen. Best when eaten warm! Recipe will work as a caramel roll OR
even just a plain sweet dinner-like roll. DO NOT use too much butter as they
will not rise enough!

     1/2      Teaspoon  salt
  2          Teaspoons  ground rosemary
  4               cups  white flour

Add enough white flour (about 4 cups) to make a barely sticky dough. Knead
until elastic. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down
and shape the loaf and let rise again.

I bake this in a clay cloche because it makes a wonderful crust. To do
this, shape the loaf in the cloche bottom and let rise the 2nd time.
Preheat the cover for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Put the cover on
the bottom and bake covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes
more.

If you don't have a cloche, just bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes, until the
loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pizza Dough:
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                tsp  dried rosemary
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2                tsp  sugar
  2 1/2              c  flour
  2                tsp  yeast
     1/2             c  mushrooms -- sliced (I use
                        canned but fresh is probably better)
     1/2             c  onion -- finely chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  2               tbsp  olive oil
  1                can  tomato soup -- (10 oz)
  1                can  tuna in water -- (7 oz)
  1                tsp  oregano
                        chili powder to taste

Prepare the crust according to your machine's instructions for dough.  When dough isfinished, spread onto greased pizza pan.  Add toppings.  Cook 425, 15-17 min.

Topping:
Heat olive oil in pan and saute onion, mushroom and garlic until tender, but not brown.  Add tuna, tomato soup and seasonings.  Let cool slightly before spreading onto pizza dough.

This tastes better, I find, topped with cheddar cheese rather than mozarella.

Now don't squinch up your noses and say "ewwwww" until you try it!

     3/4          cups  chopped walnuts

Large loaf: 1 1/2 lbs

* (3 cups+ for toastmaster, my experience )

Scald milk, stir in butter and honey and let cool to room temp. Add milk mixture and remaining ingredients ( except brown sugar and nuts) to your machine per manufacturers instructions.Serve warm or cool.

Note: I heated the milk, butter and honey in my microwave instead of the stovetop.The first time I scalded it though but microwaveing heating was easier.

Scalding milk is supposed to break down the protein in milk  and result in a better yeast product, making the job of the yeast easier. Years ago people scalded milk because it wasnt pasturized. From my extensive reading most bakers dont scald milk anymore  but rather heat it.

     1/4           cup  chopped onion

Place ingredients in the order as instructed by manufacturer.Add more flour
or water or whatever the case to get the pliable non sticky dough consistency.
During the last 10 minutes of the last kneading cycle ( or if your machine beeps
to indicate additions ) add the nuts and onions. I use the regular cycle for
white bread ( my machine is a Toastmaster)

Note: often some
breads made with walnuts will have a reddish brown discoloration
coming from the nuts.It doesn't alter the taste though.

Hope this helps people who want to convert recipes.
All it takes is time and experimentation.  If you get to know your
ingredients and how they function in a bread recipe then you are certainly
off to a good start!

NOTES : As I'm sitting here enjoying a piece of the walnut onion bread I previously posted I forgot to mention that you should not grate or shred the onions or they will get to watery. Drain the chopped onions in a paper towel to rid excess moisture. When you add them as instructed and if the dough seems to " loosen up " or get to moist, simply add a bit of flour to return the dough back to its original quality.

The loaf is very fluffy and moist so let it cool completely before cutting. If you wish less oil in the recipe you can certainly cut the amount to 1/8 cup and still have a lovely bread.  [Joan,"Flour Power"]

                  ****


                         WELL BRED MAID

First mix a lukewarm quart my daughter,
one half scalded milk, one half water.
To this add two cakes of yeast.
Or the liquid kind if preferred in the least.

Next stir in a teaspoonful of nice clear salt.
If this bread isn't good it won't be our fault.
Now add the sugar, teaspoons three;
Mix well together for dissolved they must be.

Pour the whole mixture into an earthen bowl.
A pans just as good if it hasn't a hole.
It's the cook and the flour, not the bowl or the
pan, that " makes the bread that makes the man ".

Now let the mixture stand a minute or two, You've
other things of great importance to do.
First sift the flour, use the finest in the land.
Three quarts the measure, "Gold Medal" is the brand.

Some people like a little shortening powder, If this
your choice, just add to the flour.
Two tablespoons lard, and jumble it about,
till the flour and lard are mixed without a doubt.

Next stir the flour into the mixture that's stood,
waiting to play its part to make the bread good.
Mix it up thoroughly, but not to thick,
some flours make bread that's more like a brick.

Now grease well a bowl and put the dough in,
don't fill the bowl full, that would be a sin;
For the dough is all right and it's going to rise
till you declare its twice the old size.

Brush the dough with melted butter as the recipe say;
cover with a bread towel ,set in a warm place to stay.
Two hours or more to rise light, when you see it grow
you know it's all right.

As soon as it's light, place again on the board;
Knead it well this time, here is knowledge to hoard.
Now back in the bowl it must go, and set again
to rise an hour or so.

Form the dough gently into loaves when light,
and place it in bread pans greased just right.
Shape each loaf you make to half fill the pan,
this bread will be good enough for any young man.

Next let it rise to the level of the pans- no more.
Have the the temperature just right- don't set near
a door.Be very careful about draughts - it isn't
made to freeze. Keep the room warm- say seventy two
degrees.

Now put it in the oven, its ready to bake.
Keep uniform fire, results are a stake.One hour
more of waiting and you'll be repaid,
By bread that is worthy " A Well Bred Maid".

NOTES : Here is an interesting poem with recipe included I got out of an old bread
cookbooklet. Hope you all enjoy it!  I actually made the recipe with some
changes ( I don't use lard or cake yeast etc,   and the bread really came out
very nice:  4 loaves  of a lean white bread. ) [Joan]

2.  Add ingredients (except raisins) but including the vinegar and milk, in
the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the bread
cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.
3.  At the beeper (or at the end of the first kneading in the Panasonic,
Sanyo, and National, or after 40 min from "start" for Toastmaster) add the
raisins.

=== Notes ===
This bread rises more slowly than other breads in the machine so I use the
"sweet bread cycle."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  white flour -- to 5 cups
  2        tablespoons  instant yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  gluten
  2               cups  hot water

Dump 3 or 4 cups of white flour in the KitchenAid stainless steel mixer bowl.
Add 2 Tbsp. instant yeast (I get mine at Sams, Red Star).
Add 2 Tbsp sugar.
Add 2 Tbsp gluten.
Put on the dough hook, and start the mixer at the first speed.
Run hot water in the sink till it is at its hottest, in my case about 130'.
Get two cups of the hot water.
SLOWLY add the water to the mixer, and allow to knead for 4 to 6 minutes,
adding 1/4 cups of additional flour to get the dough to pull away from the
sides of the bowl.  I use about 5 cups in all.

Place the dough in a Pam sprayed warm bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.
First rise takes about 25 minutes, and second rise about 20.

After the first rise, I cut the dough in two equal pieces and place in
sprayed loaf pans.

All tolled, less than an hour and a half, and the TEXTURE of the bread is
wonderful.

  26                Oz  flour -- about 6 1/2 cups
  1 1/2            Tsp  salt
  2               Cups  water -- room temperature
  1                Tsp  yeast -- * (1 to 2)
  1         Tablespoon  oil -- optional (1 to 2)

Place flour, salt and yeast (and oil) in Kitchenaid bowl fitted with dough hook Start machine on  speed 2. Gradually add water. Mix/knead  for 8 minutes. Dough will come together by itself and  needs no attention. (Hand kneading unnecessary!) Remove dough from bowl and place in a large  plastic container with a lid--I use a cake keeper--that has been oiled. Cover  container with a dampened tea towel and then with lid. Place in refrigerator overnight. The next morning, remove from frig and place on counter. Let raise during the day--I often let it go up to 12 hours. It will fill  the bottom of the container completely. Deflate  dough, work a bit,  and shape a round loaf. Place  on a cornmeal-dusted peel or cookie sheet. Cover with upside down plastic container. Let raise 1-2 hours, or until dough seems ready. Carefully slash loaf  about 1/8- 1/4" deep (too deep will deflate the loaf, but it will still work fine) on top and sides. Have the oven  preheated to 400, preferably with a pizza stone. Spray loaf with water, or alternatively sprinkle with flour, if desired.  Transfer loaf to cooking stone or place cookie sheet in oven. Sprits oven with water several times  during the first 10 minutes of baking, or throw a couple of ice cubes on the bottom. Bake about 40 minutes until the loaf sounds hollow or the internal temperature is 190-200 degrees.

I must admit that sometimes I get a great oven spring and sometimes not, but the loaf always looks (and tastes) good. I usually use 3 oz of either whole wheat flour or rye flour as a part of the flour weight.

* adjust the amount of yeast based on the desired raising time and the room temperature- I always use 1 tsp.

                       Yeast Raised Sourdough Cakes

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00

                Sourdough Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Krustez Sourdough Bread Mix
  12                oz  beer -- full-bodied, warm
                        -- (Alaska Brewery Amber Beer)
     1/2           cup  warm water
  3        tablespoons  dry milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  canola oil -- *
  2                     eggs
                        -- (preferably at room temperature to
                        avoid cooling the mixture)
  1            package  dry yeast
                        -- (1 tablespoon bulk yeast)

Get up a little early and start this so the yeast has a chance to get to bubbling. Getting all the lumps out a the start is not critical -- the  yeast will win over the lumps.

Cook on  hot griddle and enjoy the smell. These are tender and great with real maple syrup.

*  I usually omit the oil and use cooking spray on the griddle to lower the "F" rating.

Notes:  Works great with unbleached white flour, whole wheat pastry  flour, mixtures of flour, etc.

Use of beer in flapjack back in the "old days" provide yeast for the  pancakes. With the current microfiltered beer, yeast has to be added.

Beer can be replaced with milk -- most of the alcohol does cook off, but  Fick's Law rules and all will not leave in the time that a pancake  cooks. (yes I did a masters thesis on gas exchange in liquid) Those  with alcohol sensitivity should use milk or water.

Increase the oil, or use cooking spray on the irons to make waffles.
