                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  5        tablespoons  honey, molasses, or maple syrup
  3 1/2           cups  white whole wheat flour or flour from
                        freshly ground wheat berries, red or white
  1         tablespoon  Lora Brody Bread Dough Enhancer
     1/4           cup  sunflower seeds -- chopped
     1/4           cup  walnuts -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  regular instant yeast

In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, till it's smooth and supple. The dough will seem very wet and slack at first; just keep mixing, and eventually it'll come together, though it will remain sticky. For the optimal rise, we recommend using either a bread machine (set on the dough setting) or electric mixer to mix and knead this dough, with the bread machine being the first choice; kneading by hand will result in a smaller, denser loaf.

Allow the dough to rise, in a greased, covered bowl, for 1 hour. Shape it into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pan.
Cover the pan (with a dough rising cover, or lightly greased plastic wrap) and allow it to rise for about 1 hour, till it's crowned about 2 inches over the rim of the pan.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 45 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil for the final 20 minutes of baking. Yield: 1 loaf.

                         About Salt Rising Bread

Recipe By     :Cook and Tell, by Liz Caesar

                        ******

The phrase "salt rising" refers to an old kitchen practice of keeping the bowl of starter nested overnight in a bed of warm salt, which retains heat. It does not refer to the bread's taste.

The starter to begin salt-rising bread is a true starter where no yeast is used and is very temperamental. If the starter does not bubble up during the night to produce an oddly sweet odor, throw it out and begin again. But put it together in a different way and use a different milk or another kind of cornmeal. There is no easy explanation why one combination will work and another will not.

Salt-rising bread loves warmth. Warm everything it touches and don't let it chill. It should be kept in a place between a constant 90 to 95 degrees and should remain so for 24 hours of the starter rising.

The sponge and the dough demand less heat and attention as the bacterial strain grows. Use pasteurized whole milk. The bread should have a smooth texture and a tangy flavor and aroma.

                Rolls                           White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry yeast
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/3           cup  warm water
  3 1/3           cups  flour
  2 2/3    tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  melted butter

PREP: Angel Biscuits: one of the relatively few recipes that uses both baking soda and yeast. These Biscuits should be served warm from the oven. (Microwaves toughen dough.) They are mixed quickly like biscuits and raised once like yeast dough. Buttermilk adds the tang.

YIELD: 7"x12" dough rectangle; 26 2" biscuits.

TIME: prep 8 mins; stand; 1 hr; bake 20 mins.

INSTRUCTIONS: Stir yeast and baking soda into warm water.

Use the metal blade to mix the flour, sugar, salt and shortening, about 10 seconds.

Combine the yeast mixture and the buttermilk, and with the machine running, pour in through the small feed tube as fast as flour mixture will absorb it. Process only until just mixed; do not overprocess.

Turn the dough onto a floured board and roll into a rectangle 7"x12" and 1/2" thick; the dimensions were tested and produce the correct 1/2" thickness. Cut out 2" rounds with a biscuit cutter or an upturned small glass. Place biscuits 1-1/2" apart on a greased baking sheet and brush tops with butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Bake at 425F for 15-20 minutes, or until light golden brown. Serve warm with butter.

     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- cut up
  1                     egg
                        Filling
     1/2           cup  apricot jam -- or preserves
     3/4           cup  chopped dried apricots or golden raisins
     1/3           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted

  1         tablespoon  milk -- up to 2
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Makes 1 coffee cake. In large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast salt and mace. Heat 1/2 cup milk, water and butter until very warm (120 to 130 F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in egg and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth, about 7 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

Roll dough to 20 x 9-inch rectangle: spread evenly with jam. Sprinkle apricots and almonds over jam: roll up tightly from long side, pinching seam to seal. Form into ring; pinch together ends. Place, seam side down, on greased large baking sheet. With sharp knife, make cuts along outer edge of ring at 1-inch intervals, cutting 3/4 of the way through dough. Turn each section on its side to show filling. Cover; let rise in warm place 30 to 60 minutes or until doubled.

Bake at 350 F for 30 to 35 minutes or until done; cover with foil after 20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack. In small bowl, combine icing ingredients; stir until smooth. Drizzle over coffee cake.

Categories    : Bagels                          Bread-Bakers Mailing List
                Hand Made

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  King Arthur Special For Machines flour
  2               Tbsp  gluten
  1 1/2            tsp  kosher salt -- (1 1/2 to 2)
  1 1/2            tsp  instant yeast
  1 1/4           cups  lukewarm water
  1               Tbsp  malt extract syrup -- (1 to 2)
                        -- (or mix dry malt extract with the flour)

Mix dry ingredients. Dissolve malt syrup in the water, then dissolve yeast in the malt/water.
Mix and shape as in sourdough recipe (see Sourdough Bagels recipe). Let rise in fridge 12 to 15 hours. Remove from fridge and prepare boiling water, heat oven etc. Bagels should be ready to boil by the time you are ready. They won't need the couple hours of additional rising at cool room temp.

50-50 Whole Wheat version:
Same, but use half whole wheat flour and increase the water to 1 1/2 cups.

These all began with an article in Oct '97 Cook's Illustrated magazine by Todd Butcher.

NOTES : Don't let the length of this recipe deter you; it is really easy and not time consuming at all.
Once you have gone through it, you will have the routine down. I can, and probably have, done them in my sleep. I never buy bagels anymore, mine are as good as, if not better than, the best bakery bagels (which by the way are NOT Noah's.)

                           Baguettes, Best Ever

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bread flour
  2          teaspoons  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  instant  yeast
  10            ounces  water -- * see note

*  Adjust the water temperature so that the combined temperature of the water and flour is 130F.

Place the flour, salt, and yeast in a food processor with the steel blade.  With the machine running, pour all but 2 tablespoons of the called for liquid through the feed tube. Process for 20 seconds, and add the remaining liquid if the dough does not form a ball during this time.

Continue processing for another 25 seconds, for a total time of 45 seconds.
The temperature of the dough should be between 75-80F. If the dough is too cool, process for another 5 seconds. If it is too hot, place the dough in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes.

Place the dough in a large ungreased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and all to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at a cool temperature of 70-72F.

Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface, and divide the dough into 3 pieces. Shape into baguettes. Let them rise for 30-45 minutes. Sprinkle with flour, and slash diagonally several times.

Place a small pan on the oven flour. Preheat the oven (for one hour) to 475F. Pour one cup of water into the pan on the oven floor. Place the baguettes in the oven and reduce the heat to 450F.

Bake for 2 minutes, then quickly pour another cup of water into the pan. Bake for another 20-22 minutes until the crust is golden and taping the bottom produces a hollow sound.

NOTES : For a lighter texture, use all-purpose flour.

This dough can be used to make hearty peasant rolls or any other bread shape.

These were the absolute best baguettes I've ever made! [Ellen}

  4                     eggs
                        -- (or 6 egg whites)
  3 1/2           cups  skim milk
     3/4          tsp.  vanilla
     1/3           cup  butter -- or canola oil
  4               cups  flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        -- (I use Sucanat)
     1/2          tsp.  salt
     1/4           cup  baking powder

Beat the eggs well, add the other liquids, and then mix in the dry ingredients. Makes 24 pancakes. The key to this is not to overmix the batter; also, let it stand about 5 minutes before pouring out the pancakes.
This allows the baking powder to start working. These are the lightest, best pancakes I've ever had! Can also be frozen and reheated.

NOTES : This Mix collection is from a company called Jewel. I don't think that their product is available any longer, so I have substituted just the word shortening for the Jewel shortening. I have had excellent results using either Crisco or (lately) Mazola shortening in these recipes. Unfortunately, I think the Jewel shortening has gone to the shortening heaven with Spry and several others whose name eludes me now. Thank goodness the recipes have survived!

                       Baking Mix #10 (Master Mix)

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9               cups  sifted all purpose flour
                        -- or 10 cups sifted pastry flour
  1               Tbs.  salt
     1/3           cup  double acting baking powder
  2               cups  non refrigerated shortening
                        -- ( ie. solid white veg. kind like Crisco
                        )

Stir together dry ingredients and sift 3 times. Cut in shortening to a cornmeal crumb mixture. Store tightly covered at room temperature. If stored in glass jars, keep in a dark place. To measure, spoon lightly into a measure cup, level off with knife and use as desired. Do not pack in cup when measuring! Makes about 13 cups! You can use the mix to make almost any baking recipe you wish!
I like this because it is simple, inexpensive and makes great baked products!I have even made changes to this mix for buttermilk baking which you can find on my culinary resource page.

This mix also makes wonderful blueberry muffins, which you can find a photo and mix recipe on my muffin primer under my culinary lessons.

Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                Fruit And Spice Breads          Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Butter
  2                     Eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  Flour
     1/2      teaspoon  Salt
  1                cup  Sugar
  4                     Bananas -- finely crushed
  1           teaspoon  Baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  Vanilla
                        ***MY REVISION***
                        Pecans or walnuts

Cream together butter and sugar. Add eggs and crushed bananas. Combine well. Sift together flour, soda and salt. Add to creamed mixture. Add vanilla. Pour into greased and floured loaf pan. Bake at 350 F, 60 minutes.

Keeps well, refrigerated. Yield 1 Loaf.

My notes: I made muffins, so changed title to include that. VERY moist and flavorful. Sticky. Big hit. We added pecans. In other bakings, I've added walnuts. Both are fantastic.

Bake muffins 16 -19 minutes.

Additional notes: I've made this using frozen and thawed bananas and it was perfect. But the best of all was "baking" it in the rice steamer. Absolutely incredible!

Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                Fruit And Spice Breads          Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     Bananas -- very ripe
  1                Cup  Sugar
     1/2           Cup  Shortening -- butter
  2                     Eggs
  3               Tbsp  Yogurt -- or sour cream
  2               Cups  Flour
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  1                Cup  Walnuts -- chopped
                        Rum -- vanilla, or amaretto
                        -- optional

(1 loaf)

PROCEDURE
          (1)  Preheat the oven to 350 deg. F.  Cream  the  shortening and sugar.

          (2)  Mix in the bananas.

          (3)  Mix in the remaining ingredients.

          (4)  Pour into a greased loaf pan.

          (5)  Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 deg. F.

NOTES
If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the oven temperature and cook for a while longer. Otherwise, the crust comes out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost undercooked.

                 Barm Brack (Irish Yeast-Risen Tea Cake)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***SPONGE***
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/2      envelopes  active dry yeast -- (1 tablespoon)
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        ***DOUGH***
  1 1/2           cups  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  currants
     1/2           cup  diced candied orange or lemon peel
                        or a combination
  6        tablespoons  soft unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
  2              large  eggs
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

To make the sponge, in a small saucepan over low flame, heat the milk and water until just warm, about 110 degrees. Pour into a small bowl, whisk in yeast and stir in flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow sponge to rise for 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk.

Combine the raisins, currants and candied peel in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Drain fruit and spread it in a single layer on paper towels to cool and dry slightly while preparing the dough.

To mix the dough by hand, beat butter with sugar, salt and spices until soft and smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then continue beating until smooth and light. Stir in sponge and remaining flour. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

To make the dough in a mixer, use a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle and beat butter with sugar, salt and spices until soft and smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then continue beating until smooth and light. Beat in sponge and remaining flour. Continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

To mix the dough in the food processor, place butter, sugar, salt, spices and eggs in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 10 or 12 times at 1-second intervals to mix smooth. Remove metal blade and attach plastic blade; add sponge and remaining flour and pulse to form a dough. Process continuously for 15 seconds.

Place dough in a buttered bowl and cover with buttered plastic wrap, butter side down. Allow dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch dough to deflate and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Distribute fruit on dough

and knead it in evenly by continuing to fold dough over onto itself. Cover with plastic wrap or a dry towel and allow to rest 30 minutes.

Butter two 8-inch diameter by 2-inch deep cake pans and line the bottom of each with a piece of parchment or butter waxed paper, cut to fit. Place half the dough in each and press to make tops flat and even. Cover pans with buttered plastic wrap or a dry towel and allow Bracks to rise until doubled, up to 1 hour.

Once the Bracks have begun to puff visibly, set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. When the Bracks are completely risen, bake them for about 45 minutes, or until well risen and a deep golden brown. Test by inserting a thin knife or skewer near the center; if it is done it will emerge without any raw dough clinging to it. Cool on racks for 5 minutes, then unmold and place rack on racks to cool completely.

Yield: 2 8-inch cakes, about 20 generous servings

                        -- 1 1/2-pound:

     3/8           cup  water -- (3/8 to 1/2)

     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        -- 1-pound:
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water -- (1/4 to 3/8)
  1                     egg
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        -- or unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  RED STAR active dry yeast

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select "dough" setting, and press "start".

Once dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep. Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out dough onto a floured counter top or cutting board.

Follow directions for specific recipe.

No need to bake it in the oven. Remove the dough from your machine just before the final rise, quickly roll it out into a large rectangle, brush with some melted butter, sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar, roll up tightly and coil it back into your bread pan.
The bread will rise and bake in your machine as usual. We call them "swirl breads." They're fun and quite easy...you just have to have everything handy, work quickly, and be careful not to pull the pan out of the machine along with the dough because in some machines, that will shut them off.

NOTES : While a bialy is not a bagel, it is so closely related, and so much a part of the Jewish bread culture, that omitting it from a book on bagels would be a major gaffe. What is a bialy? It's a circle of soft dough with a center indentation containing a filling. The traditional filling is a mixture of mixed onions, poppy seeds and vegetable oil. Today, bialys can be purchased with different fillings.

Their origin is attributed to a Jewish baker from the Polish town of Bialystock, who served in the army in central Asia. He tasted one of their pastries, improvised and brought the recipe to America when he immigrated. Bialys are made with bagel dough, but they are not boiled. A softer version can be made with all-purpose flour. Try the recipe both ways and decide for yourself.

  1               tbsp  yeast
  1 1/4           cups  water -- cold
  5               cups  bread flour
  4                tsp  salt
  1               tbsp  oil and vinegar salad dressing -- safflower preferred

water and the rest of the flour. Knead 10-12 minutes.  Let rise 2 hours.
Punch down, knead another 7 minutes, and let rise another hour.  Cook
onions over very low heat for about 20 minutes - "sweat them".  Or -
microwave them for about 5 minutes.  Add poppy seeds and remaining 1 tsp salt.

Divide dough into 16 pieces, shaping them into balls.  Let sit and relax
for 1 hour in warm place covered with sprayed saran wraps they don't dry
out.  Preheat oven 450.  Flatter balls, dust with flour over the round.
Place thumb and forefinger in center and make depression - NOT a hole.
Place 1 tbsp onion-poppy seed mix in center of each bialy.  Place on
greased cookie sheet and bake 10-15 minutes.  When cool, fill center with
cream cheese, if you wish.>

NOTES : Possibly Paula's bagel with cream cheese in the center was a bialy. A bialy is a New York type roll like a bagel but flattened in the middle. Usually onions are placed there, but why not cream cheese? Try it and find out - they are good!

Serving Ideas : For use in Italian Bread (Pagnotta) [see recipe]

NOTES : Italian bread is simple, but making it is not. A good recipe is a two-day process. The first day you make "biga", a firm sponge using just flour, water and yeast. This sits in the fridge overnight. The next day you mix some of the biga with more flour, water and yeast to make the bread. (Leftover biga is frozen for future bread- making, so succeeding sessions complete in one day.) Note, no oil or sweeteners are used. The biga seems to supply the elasticity or chewiness that makes it something like French bread. It's delicious, but as I say, more work than you think.

A complete recipe follows, based on "The Il Fornaio Baking Book" by Franco Galli. Their recipe is a little more sophisticated, but I like the results I get from this slightly simplified procedure.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           Cups  blue corn meal
  1 1/2           Cups  boiling water
     3/4           Cup  all-purpose flour -- (3/4 to 1)

You will need a medium-sized bowl, a griddle or heavy skillet at least 8 inches in diameter, and a rolling pin. Place corn meal in a bowl and pour boiling water over. Stir to mix well. Let sit for fifteen minutes. Mix in one-half cup of all purpose flour. Turn this mixture out onto a bread board spread with 1/4 cup of flour. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, incorporating the 1/4 cup of flour into the dough (and if necessary, use a little more). The dough will be soft but not at all strong. Return the dough to the bowl and cover. Let rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into eight pieces. Between well-floured palms, make flat round patties out of each of the eight and set aside. Heat your griddle over medium high heat, making sure that it is hot before you cook the first tortilla. On a well-floured surface (as the dough is quite sticky), carefully roll out a tortilla until it is approximately 7 to 8 inches in diameter. (We find it easiest to first pat out the dough with our fingers or between our palms, and then to roll out the tortilla at the very last just to make it uniform in thickness). Cook the tortilla as you would a wheat tortilla, approximately one minute on each side. The tortillas will be flecked with brown on both sides. When cooked, remove and wrap in a kitchen towel. Stack one on top of another. Yield: Makes eight blue corn tortillas approximately 8 inches in diameter. Blue corn is one of many different varieties of corn grown by the Hopi and Pueblo Indians. It ranges in color from gray to blue to almost black, and is used in breads, dumplings, sauces, and in drinks. Blue corn tortillas are traditionally made without salt, as below, for salt is thought to mask the full but subtle taste of the blue corn. These tortillas are soft to eat, and not at all tough. Because they contain a little wheat flour, they are also relatively easy to handle; you can pat them out by hand, then roll them to an even thickness if need be. They are cooked quickly in a hot ungreased skillet, then wrapped in a towel to stay soft and warm until ready to be eaten.

                        stale bread

'I'd recommend you go to the day-old bread store in your area and buy $10 or $20 worth of unsliced bread. Thats a lot! Then, spend a morning or two just slicing,slicing, slicing. Thin, thick, medium, until you start getting some certainty. You can always turn the sliced bread into bread crumbs for future cooking projects (put them through a food processor and then dry them on cookie sheets at 200 F. for a couple of hours until they are dry, but not brown. These keep for months once dried & cooled.) If you don't want bread crumbs, think bird food.

Dough: You must use an electric mixer or bread machine to prepare this dough. Follow the electric mixer (or bread machine) instructions, but don't let the dough rise.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and allow it to rest, covered, for 15 minutes. Roll it into a 12 x 15-inch rectangle, allowing it to rest for 10 minutes it it "fights back." Brush with rectangle with olive oil, and sprinkle it with seasoning. Fold the dough in half crosswise with the seasoning on the inside, brush with additional olive oil, and sprinkle with more seasoning. Roll it out into a 12 x 15-inch rectangle, and cut 1/4-inch wide, 15-inch long strips. Twist the strips, and place them on lightly oiled or parchment-covered baking sheets. Let the breadsticks rise, covered, for about 30 minutes, until they look slightly puffy.

Bake the breadsticks in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15 to 18 minutes,until golden brown. Yield: about 48 breadsticks, depending on how this you cut them.

Grease or spray Pam in a bundt cake pan. Sprinkle the 1/2 cup brown sugar on bottom of pan. Now arrange the nuts and raisins over top of the brown sugar. Take your frozen roll dough and arrange in single layer on top of the nuts. Do not put the rolls too close together. From past experience, these rolls will rise and get very large. Now drizzle the melted butter or margarine over top of the rolls. Now sprinkle with the cinnamon. Sprinkle the pudding mix over the cinnamon and then sprinkle with 1/2 cup brown sugar over the pudding mix. Let rise overnight. If you want to use the same day you prepare it make sure you do it in the morning to give it at least 5 hours to rise. Bake 25 minutes at 325 degrees F. Unstick from the sides of the pan. Wait about 15 minutes then invert onto a platter. The cooler the syrup get the thicker it will become.

NOTES : Here is a wheat bread that has a wonderful texture. It's the first one that my entire family will eat. I've tried recipes that used more whole wheat but I ended up being the only one to eat the bread. The recipe calls for 1 3/8 cup liquid. I only use 1 1/4 cup in my machine so I'd suggest starting with that & then adding if necessary.

                       Buttermilk Whole Wheat Bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  warm water -- (105 - 115F)
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  warm buttermilk -- (105-115F)
                        Glaze:
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  water
                        sesame seeds

Proof the yeast by stirring the sugar into the warm water and sprinkling on the yeast. Stir to dissolve.

Add the flours, sugar, butter and salt to the processor, fitted with the metal blade. Pulse 3 or 4 times to blend.

Add the yeast mixture. Blend with 2 or 3 on/off turns.

With the processor running, slowly pour the buttermilk through the feed tube. Dough will form a ball on the blade. Process 60 seconds. Dough should be soft and moist, but not wet.

Remove dough to a floured board and knead for 2-3 minutes. Form into a ball.

Place dough in a bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise in a warm spot (80F) until doubled.

Punch down. Knead for a minute or two. Let rest for five minutes.

Shape into a loaf. Place seam side down in a buttered 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch pan. Or shape into baguettes.

Preheat oven to 375F. Brush top of bread with egg glaze and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 40-45 minutes.

NOTES : "A fine loaf for toasting or sandwiches. It has a soft texture and good crust. Makes 1 loaf."

I made this recipe many years ago, and my notes say "fantastic!". Today I'd use instant yeast and not bother with the proofing step. I also don't think the extra hand kneading is necessary.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                cup  White Flour -- Unbleached
  1 1/2            cup  Whole Wheat Flour
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  3               Tbsp  Sugar -- Or
                        Barley Malt Syrup
  2                Tsp  Salt
  2                Tsp  Dark Sesame Oil
  1                cup  Pureed Cooked Carrots
  1 1/2            cup  Lukewarm Water
  1               Tbsp  Cornmeal
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
                        Egg Wash -- Optional
                        Sesame Seeds -- Optional
                        To Sprinkle On Top

Asian flavors for a Jewish gem. Try these with a shmear of wasabi and sliced pickled ginger.

In a mixing bowl, stir together flours, yeast, sugar (if using), and salt. In another bowl stir together barley malt syrup (if using), sesame oil, carrot puree, and water. Combine both mixtures and mix to form a stiff dough. (Mixture will seem dry and shaggy at this point, but light kneading will bring it together.)

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough lightly into a smooth ball and return to bowl. Cover with plastic and set aside in a warm place for an hour to rest. (At this point the dough may be refrigerated for several hours. Set out at room temp for about 2 hrs before proceeding to step 3.)

Preheat oven to 400F. Lightly spray or brush a baking sheet with oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Set a large pot of water and 1 Tbsp sugar to boil.

On a lightly floured surface, turn out dough and divide in half. Return one half to bowl and divide the other into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a smooth ball. Flatten balls slightly, push thumbs through center, place index fingers inside, and roll into a smooth, open bagel shape. (Dough will rise to fill in hole if it isn't large enough.)

Drop 3 bagels into boiling water and boil gently, turning often, for 5 min.
Using a strainer or slotted spoon, remove bagels carefully. Rest spoon briefly on a towel to remove excess water and set bagels a few inches apart, on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining 3 bagels.

Brush bagels with egg wash and sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for about 30 min, until glossy and browned. Repeat with second half of dough.

Makes 12 bagels.

  2 1/2           cups  Whole wheat flour -- 3 cups
     1/4           cup  Popcorn flour -- *1/3 cup
  1         tablespoon  Bouquet garni -- **1 1/2 tablespoons

  1           teaspoon  Date sugar -- ***2 teaspoons

* Popcorn flour is a powder-soft flour ground from popped kernels of corn. It is something you must make yourself. Pop unflavored, unsalted popcorn, then grind the cooled, popped kernels in a blender or food processor until fine. Store it the same way you store all your flours. Approximately 3 1/2 ounces of unpopped corn yield 4 cups of unpacked flour.

** Bouquet garni is a combination of dried herbs including basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, savory, rosemary, dill, tarragon, and sage.

*** Date sugar is ground from dehydrated dates and is not actually a sugar. It is high in fiber and rich in vitamins, minerals, and iron. Date sugar can be used in baking when a textured sweetener is required. (I used granulated sugar in place of it.)

**** I replaced this with iodized table salt.

Carefully measure dry ingredients into pan. Add the beans, liquid ingredients, and yeast.

Use whole wheat mode.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough: -- *
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  oil
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2            tsp  salt
     1/2           cup  oat bran
     1/4           cup  cocoa
  4                cup  flour -- **
  2 1/2            tsp  yeast
                        Filling:
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  4        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  chocolate chips

*Dough--you can substitute your favorite rich/sweet bread or cinnamon bun dough recipe, or use this one for a 2-lb breadmaker:

**(I use all-purpose, bread flour works too, or half white/half whole wheat)

Mix and knead as usual (I use a bread machine, dough setting), and let rise twice. Divide in two portions.  Roll each 1/2" thick. Spread 4 oz softened cream cheese on each portion (8 oz total) Sprinkle 2 Tbs granulated sugar on each portion (4 Tbs total) Sprinkle 1/4 c chocolate chips on each portion and press in (1/2c total) brush water or milk around the edges of the dough roll up jelly-roll or cinnamon bun style and seal seam slice into 1" thick pieces and place about an inch apart, flat in greased pan (the recipe will fill two 8" round pans, with a little left over) let rise again for 30 minutes

Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, rotate them from front to back of oven, then bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until they turn brown (hard to see, since the dough is dark with cocoa). Delicious warm--mom took home the second pan of buns!

Apple-Cinnamon variation: substitute oat bran for cocoa (3/4 c total) mix, rise & roll out as above omit cream cheese and chocolate chips Mix together 4 Tbs sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 4 cored, chopped apples (and a little lemon juice if desired) spread apple mix over rolled-out dough roll and bake as above.



                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : My mom's a real chocoholic, so I made this variation on cinnamon buns for her on Mothers Day. These have gone to three potlucks, and I never get to take any home!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Chocolate Dough:
  1 1/2           cups  warm water -- divided
                        -- (110 to 115 degrees F)
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar -- divided
  2          teaspoons  dry yeast
  4 1/2           cups  bread flour
     2/3           cup  firmly packed light brown sugar
     2/3           cup  unsweetened alkalized cocoa powder -- sifted
  1           teaspoon  instant espresso powder
                        -- (such as Medaglia D'oro)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1              large  egg -- at room temperature
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
                        ---
                        Egg glaze:
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  water

YIELD: 2 loaves
DIFFICULTY: Easy
PREPARATION: 45 minutes plus rising, baking and
cooling times.

Make the chocolate dough:

1.In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the water with 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and set the mixture aside for 10 minutes, until foamy; if the mixture is not foamy, the yeast may be inactive and should not be used.

2.In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, place the flour, the remaining 2/3 cup of granulated sugar, the light brown sugar, the cocoa, the espresso powder and the salt. Using the paddle attachment, mix at low speed for 1 minute, until combined. Add the remaining 1 cup warm water and the egg to the yeast mixture, and add this to the flour mixture while continuing to mix at low speed. Increase the speed to medium and continue to beat the mixture for 2 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. At low speed, beat in the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is incorporated into the dough. Remove the paddle attachment and replace it with the dough hook. At low speed, knead the dough for 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium, and knead the dough for 2 minutes longer. Transfer the dough to a buttered bowl (the dough will be quite moist). Cover the bowl with a tea towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free place for 2 hours, or until almost doubled in bulk.

3.After the chocolate dough has risen, punch the dough down and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least eight hours, or up to two days.

4.Butter two 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-by-2 1/2-inch loaf pans. On a lightly floured work surface, divide the chocolate dough in two. Divide each dough half into six equal pieces, so that you have 12 equal pieces in all. With lightly floured hands, shape each piece into a perfectly smooth, round ball. Place six dough balls in each prepared pan in a zigzag pattern, pressing them lightly together if necessary. Cover the pans with a tea towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 1 hour.

5.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl whisk together the egg and water until blended. Using a pastry brush, brush the egg glaze over the tops of the loaves. Bake the loaves for 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake the bread for an additional 30 minutes. Cool the bread in the pans set on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Unmold the bread and cool the loaves on the rack completely.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour, up to 3 3/4 cups
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2           packages  FLEISCHMANN'S RapidRise Yeast
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  milk chocolate or peanut butter morsels
                        Decorations (optional)
                        jelly  beans, decorating
                        decorating  icing and/or carrot

In large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, cocoa power, undissolved yeast and salt. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120 to 130F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg, vanilla and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed, scraping bowl occasionally. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Divide dough in half. For body, knead chocolate morsels into 1 half, form into ball. Place on bottom end of large greased baking sheet; flatten to make 5-inch round. For head, remove 1/3 of remaining half; form into ball. Place on large baking sheet above body; flatten slightly, pinching to attach. For nose, pinch off 1/2-inch ball from remaining dough; lace on center of head. Divide remaining dough into 4 equal portions; roll each to form 6-inch rope. For arms, arrange 2 ropes across body; attach by tucking one end of each under body. Shape remaining ropes into ears; arrange above head. Attach by tucking one end of each under head. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Bake at 350F for 45 to 50 minutes or until done, covering with aluminum foil after 20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from sheet; cool on wire rack. Decorate as desired.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  FLEISCHMANN'S Bread Machine Yeast
                        Chocolate Glaze

Add all ingredients except chocolate glaze to the bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer, adding semisweet chocolate pieces with flour. (If dough is too dry or stiff or too soft or slack, adjust dough consistency - see Tip below. Drizzle the cooled bread with Chocolate Glaze.

Chocolate Glaze: Sift together 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon SPICE ISLANDS Pure Vanilla Extract and enough milk (2 to 3 teaspoons) to make glaze of drizzling consistency.

Recommended cycle: Basic/white bread cycle; light or medium/normal color setting.

Checking Dough Consistency: Check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; it should form a soft, smooth ball around the blade. If dough is too stiff or dry, add additional liquid, 1 teaspoon at a time, until dough is of the right consistency. If dough is too soft or sticky, add additional bread flour, 1 teaspoon at a time.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        1/4 oz pkgs  active dry yeast
  3              tbsps  honey
  1               tbsp  salt
  2 3/4            cup  high-gluten bread flour
  1 1/2            cup  golden raisins
  1               tbsp  ground cinnamon
  2              tbsps  sugar
  2                cup  whole wheat flour
     1/4           cup  yellow cornmeal

Make the dough the usual yeast dough way. Let rise once. Divide dough into twelve equal sections. Take a section and roll into ball. Poke thumbs into center and work around to make hole lager that size of a quarter. Repeat with remaining sections. Spread 1/4 cup cornmeal on each of two trays or wooden cutting boards and place eight formed bagels on each about 1" apart. Cover with clean dish towel and place in a warm draft-free spot for 20 minutes to rise. Remove towel and place boards or trays of bagels in refrigerator for 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400. In large pot bring 3 quarts of water and 1 tsp sugar to a boil. Prepare two cookie sheets by spreading them with some additional cornmeal. After refrigerating an hour, remove bagels and place them four at a time in boiling water. (kettling) The perfect bagel when kettled should sing to bottom of pot of boiling water and rice immediately. Boil for about 4 minutes, turning bagels over every 30 seconds or so with slotted spoon. If they don't sink to the bottom don't worry However if they sink to bottom and lie there whit until they rise to top and they will before timing your 4 minutes. After kettling remove bagels with slotted spoon and place them on top of clean towel for few seconds to drain. Then place bagels on cookie sheets (8). Bake 35 minutes or until golden. After taking them out of oven remove the bagel form cookie sheets and cool on rack 10 minutes.

                Fruit And Spice Breads          Hand Made


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  dark raisins -- (7.5 ounces)
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1              batch  WHITE PAN LOAVES, BIG BEAUTIFUL -- see recipe

Mix one batch of the White Pan Loaf dough according to instructions given in recipe.

Place the just mixed dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.)

While the dough is rising, place the raisins in a bowl or a plastic container and fill with warm water to come just below the top of the raisins. (If you use too much water, you will rinse away the natural sweetness of the raisins.)

Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick, and about 6 inches by 12 inches in size. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges.

Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle it evenly over the dough.

Drain the raisins and toss them with the remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Spread the raisins evenly over the dough and gently press them into it. Starting at a short side, roll the dough into a log. Roll the dough tightly, keeping the skin of the dough slightly taut, and tucking in any raisins that fall out, but don't stretch the dough so tight that the skin tears. Seal the seam of the log gently but tightly using the heel of your hand against the surface of the table, or pinch it shut with your fingers. Place the loaf in an oiled or buttered 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, and cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the loaf has risen almost 1 inch above the sides of the pans.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the loaf pan on the center oven rack. Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaf 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Spray the bread again after 2 minutes.

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is deep brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. The crust may color quickly because of the cinnamon and raisins in the dough; watch carefully and cover the top of the loaf loosely with foil if it is browning too fast. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove the bread from the pan and place the loaf on a rack to cool. Let cool completely before slicing, or the bread will fall apart. This bread keeps well for at least 2 days.

Yield: one plump 9 by 5 inch loaf

For large (1 1/2 pound)  loaf.

Place all ingredients except raisins in pan in order given.

Use nut/fruit setting, adding raisins when machine chimes.

If raisins do not mix into dough properly, try dusting them lightly with flour next time.  Also add raisins/nuts slowly, rather than all at once.

We actually prefer this bread made with dates instead of raisins.

NOTES : Ruth's notes: I use celery seed and onion powder in place of the flavored salts mentioned above. It is plenty salty without them. I mix the salt and spices in my blender before adding them to the breadcrumbs in an attempt to grind the celery seed. I use this on skinless chicken and it works just fine, and I don't usually grease the baking pan, either.

3.  Add liquid ingredients (e.g., water, milk, honey, yogurt, sour

4.  If using mixer, knead 8-9 minutes (approx)
5.  Remove dough to lightly-greased bowl; let rise until doubled
6.  Punch down; repeat rising
7.  Punch down; shape into loaves (or other forms); let rise
8.  Bake -- most standard yeast breads bake at 375-450 degrees
Fahrenheit, minus 25 degrees if you're using a convection oven. You can look at standard recipes that are similar and judge accordingly for the temperature. Bake until bread tests done (either by taking internal temperature of loaves or until loaves sound hollow when thumped -- rolls will bake for less time).

That's a very generalized sequence, but it always works for me. Differences might arise if I'm making a specialized type of bread, such as refrigerator dough, brioche, cinnamon rolls, etc., where you have rising time in the refrigerator, or special shaping methods, etc. Any good cookbook (esp. those specializing in yeast breads) will have recipes that can help you to learn the standard methodology for all of these techniques.

For simple conversion to hand from machine recipes...for almost any yeast
recipe.

Mix all ingredients.  Best if ingredients are at room temperature.
Knead for 20 minutes. Add more flour (1 TBS. at a time)if dough is sticky.
Cover with damp cloth.
Let stand (sit) for 10 minutes.

Knead again for 10 minutes. Add more flour (1 TBS. at a time)if dough is sticky.
Cover with a damp cloth or put into a well greased bowl and cover with
plastic wrap.
Let rise until double in size.
Punch down (lightly knead), then form into load.
Place into a loaf pan that has been greased and floured.
Let rise a second time until double in size.

Bake at 350 degrees. If using a glass pan, bake at 325 degrees. If using a convection oven, bake at 300 degrees. (Do not use a glass pan in a convection over as it will not brown, or cook well.)

Bake approx. 30 minutes. You can remove the bread from the pan (using kitchen gloves) after it is browned on top...thump the bottom to see if it sounds hollow...return it to the oven if it is not done (hollow sounding). NOTE: Breads with honey brown faster and darker than breads with white sugar. You may want to reduce the heat by 25 degrees in a standard oven for this recipe.

     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     3/4           cup  orange juice
  1 1/2           cups  light raisins
  1 1/2           cups  chopped cranberries
                        --fresh or frozen

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda into a large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Add egg, orange peel, and orange juice all at once; stir just until mixture is evenly moist. Fold in raisins and cranberries. Spoon into a greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack. If you choose, you may substitute cranberries for the raisins to have an all cranberry bread.

Makes 1 loaf.

Combine above ingredients by hand or in food processor. Divide mixture into 1/2 cup portions and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll out one portion at a time to approximately 1/8 inch thickness (flour work surface and rolling pin to prevent sticking). Cut out bite size biscuits (1 to 1-1/4 inch diameter) and place on ungreased cookie sheet 1 inch apart. Bake in 425 degree oven until light brown (10-12 minutes). Makes four dozen (allow at least 6 per person). Note: Uncooked biscuits may be frozen by placing entire cookie sheet in freezer. Remove biscuits to plastic bag when hard and store in freezer until ready to use. Thaw on cookie sheet before baking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Cups  Cake Flour
  1           Teaspoon  Salt
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  Sugar
  1           Teaspoon  Baking Powder
     2/3           Cup  Heavy Cream

Preheat the oven to 350F. Use an ungreased cookie sheet. Combine the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a bowl, stirring with a fork. Slowly add the cream while continuing to stir. Mix well until the dough holds together in a ball. (If the dough is still too crumbly, add another tablespoon of cream.) Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8 in. Using a cookie cutter or a large drinking glass, cut the crackers into 3 in rounds. Place the crackers on the cookie sheet, and prick the center of each cracker twice with the tines of a fork.

Bake on one side for 8 minutes, turn the crackers over with a metal spatula, and bake for 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the crackers have several golden spots and are slightly colored on the edges. Remove and place on a rack to cool.

NOTES : I have still to get better at baking crackers. You have to be as swift as when you are baking cookies.
Marion Cunningham has an excellent chapter on crackers in The Fannie Farmer Book of Baking.
Even if they are not picture perfect, they are way better than the store-bought ones.

* Date sugar is ground from dehydrated dates and is not actually a sugar. It is high in fiber and rich in vitamins, minerals, and iron. Date sugar can be used in baking when a textured sweetener is required. (I used granulated sugar in place of it.)

** I replaced this with iodized table salt.

Add flours, cornmeal, sugar, orange zest, salt, and chilies to bread machine pan.

Add water, oil, honey, and yeast.

Use whole wheat mode.

At the end of mixing cycle, add corn kernels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water -- (105 to 115 F)
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (or 2 scant tablespoons)
     1/4           cup  honey
  14              cups  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  cracked wheat
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        (or more for kneading)
     1/2           cup  roasted unsalted sunflower seeds
     1/3           cup  hulled raw pumpkin seeds
  1         tablespoon  poppy seeds
  1         tablespoon  raw sesame seeds
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil for greasing the bowl and
                        baking sheets

Makes 2 large or 3 small round loaves

In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, honey, oil, and cracked wheat and allow to proof about 5 to 10 minutes, or until the yeast is light and bubbly. Add the salt, whole wheat and white flours, and stir to combine.

Dump the dough out onto a well-floured surface and begin to knead, adding enough flour to make a nice soft dough. Knead about 10 to 15 minutes, sprinkling with more flour as necessary, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. You may want to use more flour depending on the dryness of the cracked wheat and the flours, as well as the general humidity.

Mix the seeds together and sprinkle them over the dough, reserving a few tablespoons to sprinkle over the loaves before baking. Then knead the seeds into the dough. Turn the dough into a greased bowl, cover with a dish towel, and set it in a warm place. Allow the dough to rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down. Let it rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough and shape it into 2 large or 3 small round loaves, and place them on lightly greased baking sheets. Let rise 25 to 30 minutes. Brush the loaves with a beaten egg and sprinkle on any remaining seeds. Bake the loaves in a preheated 375 F oven for approximately 30 to 40 minutes, or until the loaves are nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped. Remove the loaves from the oven and cool on wire racks.

NOTES : Cafe Latte is a bustling cafeteria and bakery tucked into one of St. Paul's oldest neighborhoods, not far from the wide, elm-lined Summit Avenue where F. Scott Fitzgerald grew up. Here, in this renovated Victorian storefront, Cafe Latte owners Linda and Peter Quinn mill their own wheat, rye, and cornmeal for daily bread specials. Dakota Bread is Cafe Latte's best seller, and patrons often call a week in advance to reserve loaves. It is a light, nutty bread studded with sunflower and pumpkin seeds from North Dakota.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***1 1/2-POUND RECIPE***
     3/4           Cup  milk -- PLUS
  2        Tablespoons  milk
  3        Tablespoons  water
  1              Large  egg
  3        Tablespoons  butter or margarine -- cut up
     3/4      Teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           Cups  bread flour
  1 2/3           Cups  whole wheat flour
  3        Tablespoons  sugar
  2          Teaspoons  FLEISCHMANN'S Bread Machine Yeast
                        ***FILLING AND TOPPING:***
  1 1/4           Cups  chopped pitted dates or prunes
     1/3           Cup  coarsely chopped walnuts -- toasted
                        *** -- (see How to Toast
                        -- Nuts tip below)***
     1/2           Cup  packed brown sugar
     3/4      Teaspoon  SPICE ISLANDS Ground Cinnamon
  1         Tablespoon  butter or margarine -- melted
                        ***GLAZE:***
     1/2           Cup  powdered sugar -- sifted
     1/4      Teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2          Teaspoons  milk -- to 3 tsp

Add dough ingredients to bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough/manual cycle. Meanwhile, for filling, stir together the dates, walnuts, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon. Set aside. When the cycle is complete, remove dough from the machine to a lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle. If dough is too elastic, cover and let rest for 10 minutes before shaping. [For 1 1/2-pound recipe, divide dough in half to make 2 braids.]

Roll dough into a 15x12-inch rectangle [two 12x12-inch squares]. With sharp knife, cut rectangle into three 12x5-inch strips [cut squares into six 12x4-inch strips]. Brush melted butter lengthwise down center of each strip. Sprinkle filling over butter. Fold long sides of dough over filling; pinch seams and ends to seal.

To shape, line up 3 filled ropes, seam sides down, 1 inch apart on greased baking sheet. Starting in the middle, loosely braid by bringing left rope under center rope; lay it down. Bring right rope under new center rope; lay it down. Repeat to end. Press ends to seal; tuck under. On other end, braid by bringing outside ropes alternately over center rope to center. Press ends to seal; tuck under. Cover. Let rise in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, 20 to 30 minutes. Bake at 350F for 30 to 35 minutes or until done, covering with foil after 20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Cool slightly. Drizzle with Glaze. Makes 1 braid [2 braids].

Cycle: Dough/manual cycle.

Making a Glaze: Combine 1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon SPICE ISLANDS Pure Vanilla Extract, and enough milk (2 to 3 teaspoons) to make glaze of drizzling consistency.

How to Toast Nuts: Toasting nuts brings out their full flavor and helps keep them crisp in breads. Spread the chopped nuts in a shallow baking pan large enough to accommodate a single layer. Bake the nuts at 350F for 5 to 15 minutes or until lightly toasted, stirring several times and checking often. Be sure to cool the nuts before adding to the bread machine.

  1                med  shaker of grated parmesan cheese -- *

*  (I don't have the oz measure because I tossed out the container after I made the brownies for last weekend's agility trial.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cover cookie sheet with foil, coat with cooking spray, sprinkle lightly with corn meal and set aside. Process liver and garlic in food processor or blender until it looks like milk chocolate. Pour into large mixing bowl and blend in the rest of the ingredients. Spread evenly onto cookie sheet (the mixture will be thick) and sprinkle lightly with corn meal. Bake until no pink is left. I usually bake them for about 30 min for one pan and then turn the oven
off but leave the brownies inside until they are cool. Cut in pieces and be ready to be loved by your dog(s).

Dump everything into a VERY large bowl. Mix this whole mess together (I use my hands, AFTER I take my rings off, another story), pat onto greased cookie sheets
& bake at 325 for 1 hour. After 1 hour turn oven off, crack oven door & allow cookies to cool in oven. Break into whatever size you want (mine like LARGE).

These freeze really well. My guys love these, they sit in front of the oven waiting.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  oatmeal
  1                cup  rye flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  melted butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  milk

Combine oatmeal, 3/4 cup of the rye flour, sugar and butter together. Slowly add the milk till a firm but slightly sticky dough forms. Scrape out dough onto a wooden board or counter. Knead in the rest of the rye flour till the dough stiffens a little. Wrap in saran wrap and chill for one hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough till 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into shapes ( I like to use scotty dog cutters). Place on lightly greased cookie sheets.
Bake for 15 minutes. Turn off oven and let biscuits rest till cool in oven with the door closed. Store in air-tight container for up to 2 weeks.

NOTES : I was happy to have a request for my recipe and it's now organized to send. There are those who say " You make the dog's biscuits? Since his diet is homemade, and mostly organic, it's natural to do the treats also for my 11yr. old Black Lab. King Arthur Bakers Catalog has a really good dog biscuit mix for the ABM. This was the beginning. I researched the dog books nutritional chapters with recipes as well. Knew I was doing it right after reading More Bread Machine Magic's good dog biscuit recipe. It's fun to watch the Food Network's Three Dog Bakery program (very gourmet). Each weeks recipes are available see: www.foodtv.com for all the cooking shows -- Bakers Dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                Pkg  Dry yeast
     1/3           cup  Warm water
  1 1/2            cup  Milk
     1/3           cup  Vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  Sugar
  2                Tsp  Salt
  2                Tsp  Nutmeg
  2                     Eggs -- Lightly Beaten
  4 1/2            cup  Flour
     1/2           cup  Melted butter
  1                cup  Sugar -- Mixed With
  1                Tsp  Cinnamon

1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it dissolve for 5 minutes. Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and heat until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm.

2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk mix. Sift in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour. Beat briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour and beat until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1 hour.

3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto it. This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent sticking, but is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 3 inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts, placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1 inch apart. These don't spread much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F. Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered. Bake about 10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted butter and a brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar. Brush each doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon sugar. Serve hot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  filtered or bottled uncarbonated water
     1/2           cup  1% low-fat milk -- warmed
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
  20 1/2          cups  flour -- (41/2 to 5)
     1/2           cup  sugar
    1/16      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- (1 stick) softened
                        Cornmeal for sprinkling

Yeast Mixture:

Mix and let proof about 5 minutes:
1 package active dry yeast
1/4 cup filtered or bottled uncarbonated water


Stir in:
1/2 cup warm 1% milk


With a fork, beat in eggs 1 at a time:
3 large eggs, room temperature


Dough:
Blend on low speed in mixer to combine:
41/2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/12 teaspoons salt


Add and blend on medium speed until mixture resembles coarse crumbs:
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened

Slowly add the yeast mixture and beat until a ball of dough is formed.  Let the dough rest in the mixer for about 5 minutes then beat it again for about 3 minutes,  adding up to an
additional 1/2 cup flour only if the dough is runny or soupy.  The dough is ready to be removed from the mixture when it holds it's shape when you pinch it
together.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and soft.
Cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.  Then knead the dough again for 3 to 4 minutes, until no longer sticky, and shape into a ball.

Place in covered bowl coated with oil.  Let dough rise until doubled in size, about 2 to 21/2 hours.

Punch down the dough and knead for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky. Divide the dough in 1/2. Set one 1/2 aside in a covered bowl.

Roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle. Use a 31/2 inch round cutter to cut out circles, place on a towel. Set the scraps aside and repeat with remaining dough. Gather the scraps together, roll out, and cut more circles to make a total of 24.

Cover the circles with a towel, let rise for 25 minutes.

Preheat an electric skillet to 350 or heat a cast-iron griddle. Sprinkle a 1/2-inch-deep bed of cornmeal over the bottom of the skillet or griddle. Place 4 or 5 of the circles on the cornmeal, spacing them 1 inch apart to allow for expansion. Cook until brown on the bottom and puffed, about 4 minutes. Turn over, and cook until brown on the other side, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the muffins to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining dough.

Freezing the dough:

To freeze the dough for future use, place it in a Ziploc bag that has been sprayed with cooking oil spray. Seal and freeze up to 3 months. To use remove the dough and place in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Let the dough thaw and rise until doubled in size.

(A Modern Version)

* (There is some confusion about the "fitches" called for in the original recipe. Apparently, the fitches referred to a herb. Cumin, fennel and nutmeg have all been suggested as the mistranslated "fitches". Take your pick or leave them out. Any of them will add a unique taste to your homemade bread.)

Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water and 1 tablespoon of honey. Set aside 10 minutes. Combine the next five ingredients. Blend lentils, oil, honey and a small amount of water in a blender. Place in a large mixing bowl with remaining water. Stir in two cups of (mixed) flour. Add the yeast mixture. Stir in salt and remaining flour. Place on floured bread board and knead until smooth. Put in oiled bowl. Let rise until double in bulk. Knead again, cut dough and shape into four large loaves. Place in greased pans. Let rise. Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes to one hour.

Debra Ridings is a friend of my daughter. She researched the bread described in Ezekiel and has been making bread as a hobby for quite some time. Word spread about her Ezekiel bread and she has quite a few customers including two health spas, and an Emory professor.

I talked with Debra to get permission to post the article below and her name. She told me she was not interested in becoming a company, and makes bread in her home because she enjoys it and anyone coming to her door wanting food will be given bread free.

She had really done a lot of nutritional research and, as she said, this bread has to contain all essential vitamins and nutrients to keep Ezekiel alive for 2 years on nothing but this bread and pure water. In order for the bread to have all this nutrition the grains must be ground, and used, on the day the bread is made. Any leftovers can be frozen for later use. She said shipping the bread was cost prohibitive (she only makes $.32 per loaf profit), but that she will be happy to share her recipe with anyone wanting to take the time to grind the grains and make the bread. If you live close enough you can buy the bread - it's $3.50 per loaf, or flour ground to your specifications, using any or these grains and beans can be purchased (I have my order in for 5 lb.). By the way she's going to Idaho to pick up 4,000 pounds of beans and grain because they can't get it to her by the time she needs it. The beans are sealed in 20 lb. buckets, and have a shelf life of about 7 years if unopened.

EZEKIEL FASTING BREAD

"TAKE WHEAT AND BARLEY, BEANS AND LENTILS, MILLET AND SPELT: PUT THEM IN A STORAGE JAR AND USE THEM TO MAKE BREAD FOR YOURSELF." (EZEKIEL 4:9 NIV)


This bread is moist and cakelike in texture. It contains 14.5 grams of protein and 2.5 grams of fiber for each 100 grams of flour. It is rich and robust in flavor, more so than any made with whole wheat flour. It should be well chewed. Ezekiel was commanded by God to lie on his left side in the town of Jerusalem for 360 days (the year calendar of the Jewish people). Then he was to lie on his right side for 360 days. This was to make a point to the people of Jerusalem that God would punish them for their sins if they did not repent. Ezekiel was sustained on this bread alone, consuming only one quart of water per day and 1/2 of a loaf of this bread. It was witnessed by the people of Jerusalem after the two year period, that Ezekiel got up and walked away, in perfect health.


The ingredients used to make the "Ezekiel" flour are as follows: Hard Red Wheat, Spelt or rye, barley, millet, Green Lentils, Great Northern Beans, Red Kidney Beans and Pinto Beans. The bread is made with this flour, water, honey, yeast and olive oil. It is all natural and the flour mixture was milled fresh, just before making the bread.

This bread contains all of the protein, amino acids, fiber, vitamins and minerals to support life, along with pure water. I hope you enjoy this treat. I know your body will thank you!

                          Farmhouse White Bread

Recipe By     :Good Housekeeping on Homearts
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads                          Daily Bread Mailing List
                Hand Made                       White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge Starter:
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  active dry yeast
                        Dough:
     3/4      teaspoon  active dry yeast
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        about 3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour

This recipe yields 2 loaves of dense, crusty bread, perfect thickly sliced and topped with jam, or filled for sandwiches. First, prepare the sponge starter 15 to 24 hours before mixing the dough, then allow 5 to 17 hours of rising before the loaves go into the oven. Don't be put off by the total amount of time needed; most of it is for rising, not active work. Yields: 2 loaves, 12 servings per loaf
Work Time: 1 1/2 hours plus rising and cooling Total Time: 1 hour and 55 minutes, plus rising and cooling

1. Prepare Sponge Starter: Into large bowl, measure flour, yeast, and 1 1/3 cups warm water (105 to 115 degrees F.). With mixer at low speed, beat 3 minutes to develop a smooth, elastic batter. Scrape starter into large bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate between 15 and 24 hours. (Starter is ready to use when it has thinned out slightly, the volume has tripled, and small bubbles appear on the surface.)

2. When starter is ready, let stand, covered, 30 minutes at room temperature before using. Meanwhile, prepare Dough: Into very large bowl, measure 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F.); stir in yeast and sugar and let stand until yeast mixture foams slightly, about 10 minutes.

3. Add starter to yeast mixture in bowl, breaking up starter with hand (mixture will not be completely blended). Stir in salt and 3 cups flour. With floured hand, knead to combine in bowl.

4. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 to 12 minutes, working in more flour (about 1/3 cup) while kneading if necessary.

5. Shape dough into a ball and place in greased large bowl, turning dough over to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place (80 to 85 degrees F.) until doubled, about 1 hour.

6. Punch down dough. In same bowl, shape dough into a ball. Cover and let rise again until doubled, about 1 hour.

7. Turn dough onto floured surface and cut in half; cover and let rest 15 minutes for easier shaping. Sprinkle large cookie sheet with flour.

8. Shape each half of dough into 7-inch round loaf. Place loaves, about 3 inches apart, in opposite corners on cookie sheet. Cover and let rise in refrigerator at least 3 hours, or up to 15 hours.

9. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Remove loaves from refrigerator. Sprinkle loaves with flour. With sharp knife, cut 2 parallel lines, 1 1/2 inches apart, on top of each loaf, then cut 2 more lines, perpendicular to first lines (pattern should resemble a tic-tac-toe board). Place 12 ice cubes in 13" by 9" metal baking pan. Place pan in bottom of oven. Bake loaves on middle rack 10 minutes. Turn oven control to 400 degrees F. Bake 15 minutes longer or until loaves are golden brown. Cool loaves on wire rack.

                  Food Processor Bread Making Technique

Recipe By     :The Best Bread Ever, Charles Van Over

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

Van Over has developed a very precise technique for making bread dough in a food processor. He details the procedure, including pictures, in his book. He also explains how to convert your favorite bread recipes to his food processor method. The book contains over 60 bread recipes.

This is absolutely one of the best books on bread making ever! [IMHO] Van Over thoroughly discusses all phases of making bread, from measuring to decorating. (And it's a good bread baking primer, even if you don't use a food processor.) I highly recommend that your friend read this book and become familiar with the exact technique. I can't begin to relay all aspects of it here, but here's a summary to help get you started: (Also see the Best Ever Baguette recipe in this digest.)

1) Put the dry ingredients in the food processor, fitted with the steel blade. (This includes the yeast; there is no need to proof the yeast first, especially if using an "instant" yeast.)

2) With the machine running, pour all but 2 tablespoons of the liquid through the feed tube. Process for 20 seconds, and add the remaining liquid if the dough does not form a ball during this time. (Use cool liquids; the combined temperature of liquid and flour should be 130F.)

3) Continue processing for another 25 seconds, for a total time of 45 seconds. (The temperature of the dough should be between 75-80F. If the dough is too hot, refrigerate it for 5-10 minutes. If too cool, process for another 5 seconds.)

4) Remove from processor and place in a bowl to rise. Follow your normal procedures for rising, shaping, and baking.

(Note that Van Over discusses temperature of the ingredients, the dough, the proofing environment, etc at length. To create a truly exceptional loaf, refer to the details in the book.)

Once you've mastered the technique, you can use most bread machine recipes in your food processor. (A food processor suitable for making bread dough will handle 3-4 cups of flour -- the same quantity as most bread machines.) If the recipe calls for last minute additions (nuts, raisins, chocolate chips, etc), I'd add them by hand because the FP blade will pulverize them.

                        -- 1 loaf batch:
  1               pkg.  yeast
     1/4           cup  water (110-115 degrees)
                        -
  1                cup  water

  1           teaspoon  salt
                        -
  2 1/2           cups  flour -- (2 1/2 to 3)
                        ---
                        -- 2 loaf batch-
  1               pkg.  yeast
     1/4          cup.  water
                        -
  2               cups  water
                        -
  2        Tablespoons  shortening
  2        Tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        -
  25 1/2          cups  flour -- (51/2 to 6)

The water can be: milk, soup, tomato juice, potato water, sour cream, buttermilk, eggs, or???

The shortening can be butter, oil, bacon drippings, mayonnaise, oleomargarine, or ??

The sugar can be: white sugar, brown sugar, honey, molasses, maple syrup, leftover frostings, dark or lite corn syrup, or??

The flour can be: all white, whole wheat, light, medium or dark rye, pumpernickel rye,
corn meal, rolled oats or oat flour, millet meal, sunflower seed meal, graham flour, all bran, wheat germ, buckwheat. Just don't put more than three types of flour in one loaf or you lose the identity of whatever else you add.

Additional flavorings: Cardamom, caraway, fennel, anise,cinnamon, nutmeg, orange peel, lemon peel, nuts of all kinds, dried fruits of all kinds, just so it doesn't create an
undesirable color or effect.

For a four loaf size, you just double the two loaf batch recipe. Use what you have on hand, just follow basic bread directions, relax and have some fun inventing your own personal loaf.

NOTES : For those who are interested in making bread by hand, rather than ABM, here is a formula I have had for at least 30 years that is very useful. I think it originated with Minnesota's Super Cook Bea Ojakangas but I am not positive!

NOTE: I rewrote the recipe to follow order of my machine. It works wonderfully in my Panasonic.

This bread tastes like stuffing! It is WONDERFUL!!!! Here are some hints from the book: 1. Use dried herbs that are flaked and not ground. If using ground, reduce the amt. by half. If using fresh herbs, double the recipe.

2. This recipe can be made with the regular, rapid, or delayed time bake cycles.

This recipes comes from "Bread Electric" from the Innovative Cooking Enterprises. I make the regular size loaf in my machine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2       teaspoon  Active dry yeast
  3               cups  Bread flour
  3        tablespoons  Wheat germ
  3        tablespoons  Wheat bran
  1 3/4      teaspoons  Salt
  2        tablespoons  Sugar
  2        tablespoons  Vegetable oil
  2                     Garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  Chopped fresh parsley
                        -- OR 3  teaspoons  dried
  1 1/4           cups  Water

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions. For DAK/Welbilt, use White bread setting. Let the loaf cool before slicing. Serve plain or toasted. "This is good bread for a steak sandwich, French dip roast beef, or a grilled mozzarella cheese and tomato sandwich. Baking the garlic right in the bread lightens the garlic flavor. If this is not a strong enough garlic statement for you, add another clove."

NOTES : I made this bread 5-16-98. Missed adding the 2 tablespoons of sugar, but it still turned out okay. I had oat bran on hand, so I used that instead of the wheat bran. I will add the additional garlic clove as specified at the end of the recipe next time. It was a good, hearty loaf and it did very nicely in my Toastmaster Bread Box.

I re-made this on 5-18-98, remembered the sugar this time and added the extra clove of garlic. The sugar must make a difference, the top of the loaf almost hit the viewing window on my machine!

                          Golden Semolina Bread

Recipe By     :King Arthur's Catalog, Winter, 1998

                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/3           cups  semolina flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  regular instant yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  nonfat dry milk powder
  4        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     3/4           cup  water, plus
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                     egg
                        sesame seeds, for crust

This tasty sandwich loaf has a beautiful golden interior, and its crust is coated with a crunchy layer of sesame seeds. It makes lovely toast and sandwiches--especially grilled cheese!

In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients except the sesame seeds, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, till it's smooth and supple. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.

Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and shape it into a log. Grease an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch bread pan, and sprinkle it heavily with sesame seeds. Place the log in the pan, brush it with a bit of beaten egg white, and sprinkle it with additional sesame seeds. Cover the pan with a dough cover, or lightly greased plastic wrap. Allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1 inch above the rim of the bread pan.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350 F oven for about 40 minutes, or until its interior registers 190 F on an instant-read thermometer. Yield: 1 loaf.

                        ***1-POUND LOAF***
     1/2           Cup  crumbled feta cheese
     2/3           Cup  milk
  1         Tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4      Teaspoon  salt
  2               Cups  bread flour
  3        Tablespoons  pitted ripe olives -- sliced
  2          Teaspoons  sugar

If the feta cheese is packed in brine, drain it well and pat dry. Crumble cheese lightly into measuring cup (do not pack cheese). Add ingredients to bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer, adding the cheese and the ripe olives with flour. (Cheeses vary in moisture content. If dough is too dry or stiff or too soft or slack, adjust dough consistency - see Adjusting Dough Consistency tip below.) Store bread in the refrigerator; bring to room temperature before serving.

Recommended cycle: Basic/white bread cycle; medium/normal color setting.

NOTES : This zesty bread will dress up any meal. Save leftovers to create croutons for a salad. Just cut the bread into bite-size cubes and spread in a single layer in a shallow baking pan. Lightly brush cubes with oil, if desired. Bake at 300F for 10 to 15 minutes or until crisp and dry, stirring once or twice.

Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads     Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Coarse Wholemeal Flour
  1                cup  Fine Wholemeal Flour
     1/2           cup  Granulated Sugar
  1               tsp.  Baking Soda
  1               tsp.  Salt
     1/4           cup  Butter
  1               tsp.  Malt Extract
  1 1/4           cups  Buttermilk
  1 1/4           cups  Guinness

Makes 1-8 x 8 Loaf

Place wholemeal flours, sugar, baking soda and salt in a large mixing bowl. Blend in butter, lifting well to give the mixture air. Stir in malt, buttermilk and Guinness. Mix until the bread is a porridge-like consistency. Do no over mix. Turn into a well-greased 8 x 8 square baking pan that has been sprinkled with wholemeal flour. Sprinkle additional flour on top. Bake for 30 minutes in a pre-heated 375-F degree oven. Bread is done when it springs back after gently pressing the top. Turn off the oven and allow the bread to cool slowly with the door open for 30-minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack. Can be served immediately.
Hint: The Guinness you select makes a difference. Guinness from a bottle will produce a "flatter" loaf. Guinness from a tin will produce a "fluffier" loaf because of the Nitrogen capsule that is enclosed in the can raises your bread. Pour your Guinness about 1-minute before you need it in the batter to get an accurate measurement and let the foam rise as the dark ale settles. Over-mixing will result in a pancake-like loaf, so make sure you keep some air in the mixing!

Hint: If you can't find Malt Extract just substitute 1 tsp. of Vanilla Extract.

                        Text on high altitude bread baking below

"At high altitudes above 3,000 feet, dough rises faster. Therefore, when baking at high altitudes some experimentation is required. Follow the suggested guidelines. Use one suggestion at a time and remember to write down
which suggestions work best for you.

Guidelines:

1. Reduce the amount of yeast by 25%. this will inhibit the bread from over rising.

2. Increase salt by 25%. The bread will rise slower and have less of a tendency to sink.

3. Watch your dough as it mixes. Flour stored at High Altitudes tends to be drier. You might add a few tablespoons of water, until the dough forms a nice
ball."

                Miscellaneous & Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  hard whole wheat flour -- or more as
                        necessary
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
                        Optional toppings:
                        Grated Parmesan
                        Cayenne
                        Coarse salt
                        Sesame seeds
                        Cumin seed

You will need a food processor, several 10- by 14-inch baking sheets or pizza pans, a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, and a clean spray bottle. Place the flour and salt in a food processor and process for 10 seconds to mix thoroughly. With the motor running, add the water in a steady stream, then process for 10 seconds longer. The dough should have formed into one large ball; if not, feel the dough: If it feels very sticky, add 3 to 4 tablespoons more flour and process briefly until a ball forms. If the dough feels dry and floury, start the processor again, add 2 to 3 tablespoons more water, and process until a ball of dough forms. Once you have a ball of dough, process for 1 minute more, no longer. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 30 seconds or so. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, and place two racks near the center of the oven.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the other pieces covered. On a lightly floured surface, with lightly floured hands, flatten a piece of dough with your palms. Then roll it out to a very thin rectangle or round, as even a thinness as possible to ensure even cooking. Gently lift the dough from your rolling surface and place it on a large baking sheet or pizza pan. Sprinkle on one of the optional toppings or leave plain. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut through the dough to make rectangular crackers. (Don't worry if they are not all exactly the same size. Variations in size and flavor will make your crackers interesting.) Spray the dough lightly with water and place on the upper oven rack. Begin rolling out the next piece of dough, keeping an eye on the crackers already baking. (Crackers brown from underneath.) Check on them 2 1/2 to 3 minutes after they go in. As soon as the thinnest patches of the dough have started to brown, take them out. If necessary, continue baking, checking every 30 seconds, but it is better to take the crackers out a little early than too late.

You will soon get a feel for timing and degree of doneness. Variables that affect timing are the heat of your oven and how thin you managed to roll out your dough. When they come out of the oven, some of the crackers will be crisp, while others will need a little time in the air to crisp up. Transfer to a large bowl, breaking up any incompletely separated crackers. Roll out the remaining dough, season, and bake. When completely cool, crackers can be stored in a well-sealed plastic bag or cookie tins for up to a month.

Yield: Approximately 13 dozen very thin crackers of varying size, averaging
1 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches

  1               part  baking soda

  1               part  starch
                        -- ie - arrowroot or tapioca or potato

The baking powder formula that works for me, & in all recipes from about 1945 on, is very simple.

Thoroughly mix equal parts of baking soda, cream of tartar & starch. The starch can be arrowroot, tapioca, potato, rice, or whatever you can eat or have at hand. I usually use tapioca starch these days. If you remember to convert when using it, you can even leave the starch out, which I tend to do for the cabin & camping.

  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

US all-purpose flour and UK plain-flour can be substituted for one another without adjustment. US cake flour is lighter than these. It is not used much anymore, but if it does come up, you can substitute all-purpose/plain flour by removing three tablespoons per cup of flour and replacing it with corn starch or potato flour.

Self-raising flour contains 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt for each cup of flour.

US whole wheat flour is interchangeable with UK wholemeal flour.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  boiling water
     3/4           cup  cracked wheat
     1/3           cup  honey
     3/4           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 F)
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (or 2 scant tablespoons)
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  whole wheat flour -- up to 4
                        Vegetable oil for greasing the bowl and
                        baking sheet

Makes 2 to 3 loaves.

Cracked wheat, milled from wheat berries that have been broken apart by a coarse grindstone, is high in protein, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. In this recipe the cracked wheat adds a nutty flavor and texture to a wholesome loaf of bread.

In a large bowl, mix together the boiling water, cracked wheat, and honey to soften the wheat; let cool, then add the warm water. The entire mixture should be "baby bottle" temperature (105 to 115 F). Stir in the yeast and let this stand about 5 minutes, or until the surface becomes foamy. Add the white flour and beat 100 strokes. Let this rest 45 minutes, then stir it down and add the salt and enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough. It should clean the bowl as you stir.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead about 10 minutes, adding as much flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. When the dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a lightly greased bowl. Cover it with a towel and allow to rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down, cover it, and again allow it to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down once again. Turn it onto a lightly floured board and knead it several turns. Shape it into 2 or 3 oblong loaves and place them seam side down on a lightly greased baking sheet. Allow these to rise about minutes.

Make diagonal slashes using a sharp knife on top of the loaves. Bake the loaves in a preheated 350F oven for 35 minutes, or until they sound hollow when tapped. Remove the loaves from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

Tested in a Toastmaster Bread Box.

Assemble ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions. The bread is good warm, cool, or toasted. It stales faster than store-brought white bread, so wrap the loaf well and use quickly or
freeze.  Makes 1-1/2 pound loaf.

NOTES : This is a really yummy bread. It is from a recipe I modified. The original had too much liquid and I experimented adding the vitamin C powder and ginger...read somewhere that it enhances the dough. Well, I don't know what it does, but this loaf almost hit the top of my machine! We love the mellow taste, not sure if it is the butter or the honey?

Put all ingredients except currants or raisins in bread pan and process on dough stage. Add currants or raisins at beep or after first kneading. [Sometimes I just knead them in by hand after dough cycle complete.] Lightly oil a 9 inch square pan or 10 inch round pan for smaller recipe, a 9 x 13 inch pan or two 8 x 8 square pan for larger.

When dough is ready, remove from pan and punch down. Cut smaller recipe into 12 to 16 equal pieces, the larger recipe into 18 to 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place each ball about 1/2 inch apart in baking pan. Cover loosely and set in warm place to rise until doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375F. With a sharp knife or razor blade, cut a cross in the top of each roll. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the roll comes out clean.

Make a glaze of 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 Tbsp milk or cream and 1/2 tsp lemon. Add sugar or mild if needed to give it a consistency to drizzle over the rolls. Let rolls cool slightly but not completely. drizzle icing in a cross, following cuts in the top of bun.

     1/2           tsp  nutmeg
  2               TBSP  milk -- (approx)

(1 1/2 lb recipe)

Place milk, eggs, butter, salt, flour, sugar, spices & yeast into bread machine pan in the order suggest in your manual. Process on the dough cycle.

When the cycle is complete, transfer dough to lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle. Knead in currants & peel.

Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball & place on large greased baking sheet. Cover & let rise in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 15 - 20 minutes. lightly beat together egg white & water: brush over tops of buns. If you don't want to add icing to your buns, at this point, cut a cross into the top of them. For a decadent touch you can use marzipan to form a cross now - be warned that marzipan grows when it bakes so use a very stingy log ( 1/8-inch ). Put the marzipan on top of the egg-wash so it will stick.

Bake at 375F for 15 to 18 minutes ( my oven does them in 12 to 15 minutes ) or until done. Remove from baking sheet & cool on rack. ICING - In a small bowl, mix icing sugar & enough milk to make icing of desired consistency. Pipe on in the form of cross on each or smooth over the top if marzipan used.

     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4 1/2    tablespoons  yeast
     1/2           cup  dried currants
  1                     egg white -- beaten
                        ---
                        FROSTING
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  margarine, unsalted
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1         tablespoon  milk -- possibly 2

ROLLS
Place ingredients in machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Use the "dough" setting and press "start." When the machine beeps remove the dough and proceed as follows.


In my previous post I omitted one important bit of information in the recipe for hot cross buns. Do not place the currants in the machine with the rest of the ingredients. Also, don't use the "Raisin Bread" setting. The currants are too tender and usually get badly torn up. Instead, after removing the dough from the machine, gently knead in the currants by hand so they stay in one piece, then proceed as outlined.

Preheat oven to 375F.

Grease a 15x10x1 inch baking pan. Punch dough down (if your machine hasn't already done so) and divide into 24 equal parts. Shape into balls, place into baking pan and brush tops with beaten egg white. Let rise until doubled in bulk. Bake 15 to 20 min until golden brown.

ICING
In a small bowl combine all frosting ingredients. Beat well adding enough milk to achieve the proper consistency. Let buns cool slightly, then using a cake decorator pipe a cross on the top of each bun.

NOTES : Every Easter I make several pans of these the day before, divide them into the appropriate breakfast sized portions and deliver them that afternoon to various family members for their Easter breakfast. The grand kids rave about them so, having passed the grand kid test, I suppose they're petty good, and as you know, grand kids always tell it like it is. Hope you like them.

                Rolls                           Sweet Breads & Cakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry yeast
     1/3           cup  warm water
     2/3           cup  milk -- cold
  5        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  cloves
  3               cups  flour
  1                cup  currants
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        ***ICING***
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
  2 1/4      teaspoons  water

PREP: These famous yeast buns, full of currants and fragrant spices, can be baked in advance and frozen. If you freeze them, glaze and frost after reheating. They are best when served slightly warm.

Suggestion: Let the dough rise inside a 1-gallon plastic bag closed with a twist tie. See tips.

TIME: Prep About 7 minutes; stand 1 hr.; bake 18 mins.

INSTRUCTIONS: Sprinkle yeast over warm water. Let stand until a thin film forms, about 3 minutes, then combine with the cold milk in a sufficiently large liquid measure (e.g., 2-cup Pyrex).

Use the dough blade to mix the butter, sugar, salt egg, spices and flour, about 10 seconds. With the machine running, slowly pour the yeast-milk mixture through the small feed tube as fast as the flour will absorb it and knead for about 45 seconds (**) Add the currants and pulse just to combine, about 5 pulses.

Place dough in a floured 1-gallon plastic storage bag, squeeze out the air and close at the top with a twist tie. [see tips] Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes.

Use a 1/3 cup dry measure to divide the dough into equal pieces and shape into round balls. Place on a greased baking sheet and use a serrated kitchen knife to make an "X" across each bun. Cover, drape loosely with plastic wrap and let rise 1 hour, or until almost doubled.

Preheat oven to 375F. Bake 2 inches apart on a well greased baking sheet for 18 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let cool on a wire rack, and while still warm, brush the tops lightly with honey.

ICING: Stir the powdered sugar and water until smooth. Drizzle icing over the "X" on each roll.

KNEADING NOTE **Sweet dough is stickier than regular bread dough; it does not form a ball or clear the sides of the bowl. Forty-five seconds is adequate kneading time.

TIPS: Place dough in bag. Push the excess air from the bag. Twist the top of the bag from the dough ball to the end of the bag and tie it off about 1 inch from the edge. Dough will rise and fill the 'twist' space. ALT: Placing the dough in an oiled glass bowl, turning it over and covering.

NOTES : I have a recipe for * Injera (Ethiopian Bread) * I saved from the Philadelphia Inquire in 1983 after having dinner at a restaurant reviewed. But, "this version has been adapted for the American kitchen and won't take three days to make". I will search the Inquire archives for the original article.

The initial response to the Digest inquiry (in 1986) was more authentic.

  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  caraway seed -- optional

  1                cup  buttermilk
  1                     egg

Set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt and stir well to mix.

Add the butter and rub in until the butter disappears into the dry ingredients.

Stir in the caraway seeds if used and the raisins.

In a small bowl, whisk the buttermilk and egg together and mix into the dough mixture with a rubber spatula.

Turn the dough out on a floured work surface and fold it over on itself several times, shaping it into a round loaf. Transfer the loaf to one cookie sheet or jelly roll pan covered with parchment or foil and cut a cross in the top. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, until well colored and a toothpick plunged into the center emerges clean.

Cool the soda bread on a rack and serve with plenty of sweet butter and bitter orange marmalade.

Yield: One large loaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  1                cup  currants
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda

  2                     eggs
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk

PREP: This recipe takes under 5 minutes to prepare. Turning this traditional bread into muffins shortens baking time too. Whole wheat flour adds wholesome fiber and buttermilk provides low calorie protein and an interesting flavor.

ALT: The batter works equally well in bread form; just bake in a high, 9" round cake pan for about 55 minutes.

TIME: Prep about 5 mins; Bake about 20 mins.

INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350F. Prepare (spray or oil) standard (2 3/4" diameter; 1/3 cup capacity) muffin tins.

Use the metal blade to mix all ingredients except the last two, about 5 seconds. With the machine running, add the eggs and buttermilk through the small feed tube. Mix 10 seconds. Do not overmix.

Fill the muffin tins 3/4 full with batter. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            tsp  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  7               cups  bread flour

Mix yeast with warm water and let sit till creamy, about 15 minutes. Measure flour into bowl, stir in salt, then add yeast mix, cool water, and biga. Mix until thoroughly combined, then knead 15-20 minutes by hand (instead, I use a bread hook on my KitchenAid for several minutes). Shape into a ball, place in bowl with covering, and let rise till doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down, fold edges into the bottom to make a ball again, then let rise again till doubled (about an hour). Sprinkle cornmeal on a baking sheet. Divide the dough into two, form each half into a round or oval, place on baking sheet. After 30 minutes start the oven at 425, with a baking stone inside if you have one. Let dough rise 45 minutes or so, till the dough springs back slowly when indented with a finger. Mist the oven with a spray bottle containing water. Put the bread tray in and mist again. After 5 minutes mist one more time, and reduce the oven to 400 degrees. Bake another 40 minutes or so, till done.

NOTES : Italian bread is simple, but making it is not. A good recipe is a two-day process. The first day you make "biga", a firm sponge using just flour, water and yeast. This sits in the fridge overnight. The next day you mix some of the biga with more flour, water and yeast to make the bread. (Leftover biga is frozen for future bread- making, so succeeding sessions complete in one day.) Note, no oil or sweeteners are used. The biga seems to supply the elasticity or chewiness that makes it something like French bread. It's delicious, but as I say, more work than you think.

A complete recipe follows, based on "The Il Fornaio Baking Book" by Franco Galli. Their recipe is a little more sophisticated, but I like the results I get from this slightly simplified procedure.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           Cups  water -- 110F
  1         Tablespoon  honey
  1                Cup  all-purpose flour
  1         Tablespoon  yeast
  3               Cups  bread flour
  1                Cup  all-purpose flour
  2        Tablespoons  kosher salt -- or
                        -- 1 tablespoon salt, plus
                        -- 2 teaspoons regular salt
  1         Tablespoon  olive oil -- not extra virgin
  1                     egg white
                        -- beaten w/ 1/4C cold water
     1/2           Cup  sesame seeds

Note* This will be a very stiff dough and will be slow to rise.

Combine the first four ingredients and mix together well. (This is a sponge, a mixture that helps the yeast develop and increase volume during baking.) Let the mixture sit covered with plastic wrap until very bubbly and it falls back on its own, about 20 to 30 minutes depending on the room temperature.

Add the next four ingredients and mix by hand or on a mixing machine with a dough hook for 8 minutes at low speed.

After mixing, place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise in a warm draft- free place until double in size. This will take about 1 hour. After it has risen, punch it down and repeat the process one more time.

Pre-heat oven to 400F.

Beat the egg white with the water and set aside.

After the rising process, place the dough on a floured surface and divide in two equal pieces. Now divide each ball in three. Roll the pieces into 3/4 inch by 18 inch strips. Place 3 strips parallel with each other and 2 inches apart. Pinch the dough together at one end and begin to braid the dough. If you don't want to braid the dough you may form the dough into two round loaves. Place the loaves on greased baking sheets. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise for 40 minutes. Carefully and slowly remove the plastic wrap, brush the dough with the egg white mixture all around and sprinkle liberally with the sesame seeds. *(Note if you have formed round loaves---Make 4 deep slashes with a razor blade or sharp knife across the top of the dough, being careful not to tear and deflate the dough.)

Place in the pre heated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, turning the baking pans around after 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks. Enjoy when slightly cooled with your favorite Italian dish and Virgin Olive oil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3          cup.  lukewarm water
  1               tbs.  olive oil
  2               cup.  bread flour
                        -- (I have used all-purpose)
     1/4          tsp.  salt
  1 1/2           tsp.  sugar
                        freshly ground pepper -- (optional)
  1               tsp.  dried basil
  1               tsp.  dried oregano
     1/2          tsp.  thyme -- (optional)
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced (2 to 3)
  1               tsp.  active dry yeast
                        white cornmeal

Makes one 15" pizza shell

Place all ingredients except cornmeal in breadmaker; set on dough cycle. Remove dough when done and turn out on counter sprinkled with cornmeal. Shape into circle with your hands. Dust wooden peel with cornmeal and lightly roll out circle to fit on peel. Sides can be raised if desired. Lightly brush with olive oil and pierce every inch or so with fork to prevent bubbles. Allow to sit in warm place for 20 minutes. Cover with favorite toppings and sauce. When pizza stone is at 500 degrees, open oven, mist sides of oven with water sprayer quickly, and jerk pizza off of peel onto stone. Pizza will only take a few minutes to bake. Remove with large, wide restaurant spatula.

Note: Two teaspoons of dried rosemary can be substituted for Italian herbs. I use this variation when making white pizzas. Dough can be made ahead and refrigerated in a plastic bag for up to 3 days.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
  1 1/4         sticks  butter -- softened
                        -- (12  tablespoons)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     egg yolks
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (or 2 scant tablespoons)
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (about 105 to 115 F)
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        ***APRICOT OR PRUNE FILLING***
                        -- (Makes about 1 3/4 cups.)
  2               cups  pitted prunes or dried apricots
  1                cup  orange juice
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3          teaspoons  grated orange rind
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        (or orange juice)
                        Confectioners' sugar for dusting

Makes about 24 buns.

Claimed by Czechs and Poles, these sweet buns are served with morning and afternoon coffee. Fillings of prune, apricot, poppy seed, or cottage cheese are folded into an envelope of dough and baked until golden brown, then sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.

Scald the milk by bringing it just to a boil, then remove it from the heat, and add the butter, sugar, and salt. Cool to room temperature and beat in the egg yolks. Dissolve the yeast in warm water and add to the milk mixture with 2 cups of the flour. Beat this for 5 minutes, until smooth. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a very soft dough. Cover the dough with a towel and allow it to rise in a warm place until double in volume, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, make the filling. Chop the fruit and mix with the orange juice, water, and sugar in a medium-sized saucepan over medium-low heat until the mixture becomes thick, about 15 minutes. Cool, then stir in the orange rind and liqueur (or orange juice). Pour this into a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until the fruit is coarsely chopped.

Stir the dough down with a wooden spoon. Turn it out onto a lightly floured board and knead it with floured hands for several minutes. Divide the dough in half. Cut each half into 12 pieces. Lightly roll or pat each piece into a small rectangle and place on a greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Place a dollop of filling on each rectangle, then fold each corner up toward the center to cover the filling, but allow some of it to peep through. Let these rise about 45 minutes, or until double in size. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve warm.

                             Kummelweck Rolls

                Rolls                           Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/3           cups  high-gluten flour
  1 1/3           cups  bread flour
  2        tablespoons  non-instant nonfat dried milk powder
  2        tablespoons  potato flour
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     egg
                        Kummelweck Topping:
                        caraway seeds, kosher salt , pumpernickel)

Combine all of the ingredients except the topping, and mix, knead and raise the dough as instructed in the recipe for Golden Semolina Bread.** Divide the dough into six 3 1/4-ounce pieces, and shape them into smooth, slightly flattened rounds. Place them on a baking sheet, covered, to rise for 1 hour, or until they're good and puffy.

Brush the rolls with a bit of melted butter, and sprinkle lightly with the topping. Use more or less topping, according to your taste tolerance for salt.

Bake them in a preheated 425 F oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until they're golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack; they're best served the same day they're made, though they do reheat nicely. Yield: six large rolls.

**In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, till it's smooth and supple. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.

  1 3/4           Cups  (10 1/2 ounces) dried figs -- diced
     1/2           Cup  (4 Ounces) Warm Water -- (85-90F)
  2 2/3           Cups  (12 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 2/3           Cups  (6 1/2 ounces) cake flour
  1 3/4           Cups  (5 1/4 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats

     1/2           Tsp  Kosher Salt
  1 1/3           Cups  (11 ounces) maple syrup
  1 1/3           Cups  (11 ounces) milk
  4              Large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  2              Large  egg yolks
     3/4           Cup  (6 ounces) canola oil
  2               Cups  (8 ounces) walnut pieces -- toasted
                        Additional maple syrup for glazing

Recipes courtesy of Amy Sherber from her book Amy's Bread

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 F.

Put the diced figs in a medium bowl and add the warm water. Let soak until softened.

Whisk the unbleached flour, cake flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.

Put the maple syrup, milk, eggs, egg yolks, and canola oil in a medium bowl and stir with the whisk to combine. Add the mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a spoon just until all the flour is moistened. This should be a wet batter, because the oats absorb a lot of the liquid during baking.

Fold the walnuts and figs into the batter (the figs do not need to be drained). Divide the batter evenly between two oiled 9- by 5-inch loaf pans. Bake for about 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (If your oven bakes unevenly, rotate the pans from left to right and front to back about halfway through the baking time.)

Remove the pans from the oven and use a pastry brush to glaze the tops of the loaves with maple syrup. Set them on a rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Turn the loaves out of the pans and set them on the rack to cool completely before serving. Wrap any leftovers tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. They may also be frozen, wrapped first in aluminum foil and then in plastic wrap or a heavy-duty freezer bag.

Yield: 2 (9- by 5-inch) loaves

Several years ago I took a bread baking class and the teacher told us how to make our own "Pam" for bread pans by using 1 part liquid lecithin to 2 parts oil and mix together in a plastic squeeze bottle - I use a plastic honey bottle with a lid that pops up and down. When I clean it between fillings I use dishwasher detergent since the lecithin is pretty thick. I have used this "Pam" for years now on all my cake pans, casserole dishes and bread pans. It works great. The bread falls out so easily and the dishes clean up in a snap.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                cup  whole millet
  1 1/4            cup  hot water -- to soak the millet
  3           packages  dry yeast
  2                cup  warm water
  2               Tbsp  honey
  1                cup  unbleached white flour
  6                cup  whole wheat flour -- to 7 cups
  3               Tbsp  corn oil
  1               Tbsp  salt
  1                     egg -- plus
  1               Tbsp  milk as egg wash

Start the millet soaking in the hot water. Use very hot tap water, not boiling water, which will make the millet too soft.

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl. Then, stir in the honey, white flour and 1 1/2 cups of the whole wheat flour. Beat vigorously with a spoon to form a smooth thin batter. Cover and set aside to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.

Stir in the corn oil, salt and millet, including any of the water that has not been absorbed. Then fold in about 3 cups of the whole wheat flour, 1/2 a cup at a time, giving the bowl a quarter turn between folds to approximate kneading. When the dough is too thick to fold in any more flour, turn out onto a floured work surface, and knead, adding only enough flour to prevent sticking.

When the dough is smooth and elastic, after 5-8 minutes of kneading, place it in an oiled bowl, turn it over to coat the top and cover. Let it rise until doubled in size, 45 minutes. Punch the dough down and let rise again, about 35 minutes.
Shape the dough into two loaves and place in oiled bread pans. Let them

until doubled in size. about 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F, brush the tops of the loaves with the egg wash. Bake until nicely browned on the top and sides, about 50-60 minutes.

Oh yes, I like millet!

NOTES : The whole kernels of millet give this wheat bread a crunchy texture and a grainy sweetness.  It makes exceptionally good toast, grains of millet take on a nutty taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dry Ingredients:
     2/3           Cup  Whole-wheat flour -- preferably
                        stone-ground
     1/3           Cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           Cup  oat flour -- or other flour
                        -- corn meal or barley
                        -- buckwheat or millet
  2                Tbl  Wheat germ
  2               tsp.  sugar -- optional
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2          tsp.  baking soda
     1/4          tsp.  salt -- optional
                        ---
                        Wet Ingredients:
  1                Cup  buttermilk -- (or Yogurt)
  1 1/4            Cup  or more skim milk
  1                     Egg white -- (optional)
  1              Whole  egg -- (optional)
  1                Tbl  Vegetable oil
     1/4          tsp.  vanilla extract -- (optional)

1. Mix together all the dry ingredients in a medium bowl.

2. In a second bowl, combine the wet ingredients, whipping them enough to beat the egg white and whole egg lightly. Add these to the dry ingredients, stirring just to combine them. The batter can stand for 10 minutes out of the refrigerator or for an hour or more refrigerated.

If you do not have oat flour or an alternative, add another 1/4 Cup of whole-wheat flour to the dry ingredients.

Note: I just use an 8 oz. Dannon Vanilla Yogurt cup and leave out the sugar and vanilla. I usually add a little more milk, the batter according to directions is very thick.

NOTES : Since there's been some interest in pre-mixing, here's a recipe for pancakes that does very well with premixed dry ingredients. I make up a bunch of zip-lock bags of the dry ingredients; it saves a lot of time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  whole milk
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (or 2 scant tablespoons)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  7 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  butter -- softened
                        plus a little more for greasing the bowl
                        and bread pans

Makes 2 loaves.

Scald the milk in a saucepan by bringing it just to a boil and quickly removing it from the heat. Cool to "baby bottle" temperature (105 to 115 F), pour it into a large bowl, add the yeast and sugar, and let it "proof" (become foamy on top) for about 5 minutes. Then add 3 cups of the flour, the salt, and butter, and beat the dough until smooth. Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead it until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, sprinkling with flour as needed. Then place the dough in a bowl lightly greased with butter, turning the dough so it is also lightly greased. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes. Punch the dough down and shape into 2 loaves. Place these loaves in lightly greased 9-inch bread pans and allow them to rise 1/2 inch above the pans, about 45 minutes. Bake the loaves in a preheated 400F oven for about 45 minutes, or until the loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove the bread from the oven, turn out of the pans, and cool on a wire rack.

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips
                Vegetable & Herb Breads         Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/2            Tsp  Baking Powder
  2                     Eggs
     1/3           cup  Milk
  15 1/4            Oz  Corn
  1              Whole  Kernel Corn, Drained
  1               Tbsp  Butter Or Margarine -- Melted
                        Oil -- For Deep-Frying
                        Confectioner's Sugar
                        Maple Syrup -- Warmed

The recipe is actually from The Old Tavern in Unionville, Ohio. See the notes at the bottom for changes I made to it.

In a bowl combine flour and baking powder; set aside. In another bowl, beat the eggs and milk; stir in corn and butter. Stir into dry ingredients just until blended. In a deep-fat fryer or electric skillet, heat oil to 375. Drop batter by heaping teaspoonfuls into hot oil; fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioner's sugar. Serve with syrup.

Yield : about 2 dozen.

Notes : I used only 11ounces of corn and it turned out great. I tried the full 15-1/4 ounces and it was too much corn. Also, we just used the confectioner's sugar, the syrup made it way too sweet for us. If you want, put a little confectioner's sugar into a bowl and dip a little before you eat it.

  1               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast -- Or
  1         1/4 Oz Pkg  Yeast
  1 1/2            cup  Water -- Lukewarm

  3                cup  Bread Flour -- Plus
                        Extra For Kneading
     1/2           cup  Whole Wheat Flour
  2                Tsp  Coarse Salt
  2        Lg   Cloves  Garlic -- Minced
     1/4           cup  Finely Chopped Kalamata Olives
  1                Tsp  Minced Fresh Rosemary

Flatbread, called fougasse, is enjoyed throughout Provence. This assertively flavored fougasse can be cut into small squares for an appetizer or larger squares to be served with a meal.

In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over water and stir with fork to dissolve. Let stand 5 min. Whisk in 4 Tbsp olive oil.

In separate bowl, mix bread flour, whole wheat flour and 1 tsp salt. Add flour, one cup at a time, to yeast mixture, stirring well after each addition. When dough begins to come away from sides of bowl, turn out onto lightly floured work surface. Knead in garlic, olives and 1/2 tsp rosemary. Continue kneading, adding more flour as needed, until dough is shiny, elastic and no longer sticky, about 10 min.

Transfer dough to lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat all sides with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside until dough triples in volume, about 2 hrs.

Punch down dough and place in a greased 13 x 9" baking sheet. Press and pat dough until it covers entire surface of pan. Cover with a towel and let rise until dough reaches top edge of sheet, about 45 min.

Preheat oven to 400F. Just before baking, dimple dough with fingertips and drizzle surface with 2 Tbsp olive oil. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tsp rosemary and remaining 1 tsp salt. Place on middle oven rack. Put an empty baking dish on lower rack. Quickly pour 1 C boiling water into empty dish and close door. Bake until bread is well risen and golden 20 - 25 min. Remove bread from pan to wire rack. Brush surface with remaining 1 Tbsp oil. Cut into squares and serve warm.

Makes 16 servings

NOTES : I have found that a slightly different (and possibly authentic??) texture is achieved in Italian recipes, such as the "Olive Rosemary Flatbread" posted by Reggie Dwork, if I use Pasta flour instead of strong bread flour. The pasta flour seems to give a crumblier and more 'fragile' result and seems very good with high oil breads. [Vernon Webster <vernon@the-spa.demon.co.uk>]

  2                cup  Buttermilk

Prep: 35 min plus rising and cooling
Bake: 30 - 35 min
Makes 2 loaves, 8 servings each

In 10" skillet, melt margarine over med heat; add chopped green onions and cook, stirring frequently, 5 min or until tender. Remove skillet from heat; stir in chopped parsley and dill. In large bowl, combine yeast, sugar, salt, 1/2 C cornmeal, and 2 C flour. In 1 qt saucepan, heat buttermilk and 1/4 C water over low heat until very warm (120 - 130F).

With mixer at lower speed, gradually beat liquid into flour mixture just blended. Increase speed to med; beat 2 min.

Beat in 1/2 C flour to make a thicker batter. Beat 2 min longer, scraping bowl frequently with rubber spatula. With wooden spoon, stir in green onion mixture and remaining 1 1/2 C flour to make a stiff batter. Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap; let rise in warm place (80 - 85F) about 1 hr, until doubled. Grease two 1 1/2 qt round casseroles; sprinkle evenly with cornmeal.

With wooden spoon, stir down batter; divide in half and turn into casseroles. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let rise in warm place about 45 min, until doubled.

Preheat oven to 375F. Sprinkle tops of loaves lightly with cornmeal. Bake 30 - 35 min, until loaves sound hollow when lightly tapped with fingers. Remove loaves from casseroles; cool on wire rack.

NOTES : Sweet or savory batter breads are the easiest of all yeast breads to prepare. The dough is simply beaten - not kneaded - and turned into a casserole or baking pan, so no shaping is required. For best results, use a wooden spoon to beat the batter (which will be stickier than standard yeast-bread doughs) until it's very stiff - you should be able to stand a spoon in it.

NOTES : I have still to get better at baking crackers. You have to be as swift as when you are baking cookies.
Marion Cunningham has an excellent chapter on crackers in The Fannie Farmer Book of Baking.
Even if they are not picture perfect, they are way better than the store-bought ones.

  1 1/4           Cups  water
  3               Cups  bread flour
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  2          Teaspoons  dry yeast

Place into the bread machine in the order given. Place on dough or pizza cycle. Both work well. Remove when finished and shape into a round in a pie pan which is oiled. Let rise approximately 30 minutes. For pizza bread...put finger holes in top. Rub with olive oil, salt and pepper. Bake at 400F for 20-25 minutes. (This produces a flatten bread which I believe ended up being named Focaccia! with some additional toppings.) For a loaf of bread, I do the same thing, except that I do not punch holes in the top. I lightly rub the top with olive oil...not necessary and bake at 400F.
For pizza....this will yield two pans of thin crust. Top and bake this at 425F.

NOTES : This bread is not good baked in the bread machine.
A friend sent me this recipe. She stated the pizza bread is a long time tradition in our family. She uses the bread machine to make the dough and then hand forms it and bakes it in the oven. Do not make this into a loaf of bread in the machine.

Let rise as usual, punch down, form rolls, place on cornmeal coated pizza peel, let rise, slide onto pre-heated pizza stone (pre-heat on broil for 20 minutes at least), turn down oven, to about 400F, bake, spraying with water two or three times. Take out when done. Slather with butter. Eat.

These rolls remind me of the brotchen I ate in Germany years ago.

NOTES : The pizza dough is the same one on the Fleischmann's Yeast Bakers' site. I usually make a double batch, and that makes 16 rolls. No, I do not have a fancy oven, I use a spray bottle and spray the rolls and the oven several times in the baking. Also, I read somewhere that it is *not* a good idea to throw ice cubes in the oven. The recipe (which is supposed to make two thin crust pizzas) is something like:

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Pkg  Frozen Puff-Pastry -- (17 1/4 Oz)
  3                 Lg  Egg Yolks -- Beaten
     3/4           Tsp  Salt
     1/4           Tsp  Freshly Ground Pepper
     1/4           cup  Poppy Seeds

The dough for these sticks is easiest to shape when it's firm. If your pastry becomes too soft, place it in freezer until it has hardened again.

Heat oven to 425F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Dust a clean work surface with flour, and roll each piece of puff pastry into a 10 x 14" rectangle, lass than 1/8" thick. Transfer the rolled-out dough to baking sheets; refrigerate for 15 min.

Remove dough from refrigerator, and generously brush one puff-pastry sheet with egg yolk. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the sheet, then cover with poppy seeds. Brush the second pastry sheet with egg yolk, and place on top of first, yolk sides together. Gently press the two sheets together so the poppy seeds stick between them. Return the pastry to refrigerator, and chill another 15 min.

Remove the pastry from the refrigerator, and brush the top generously with the remaining egg yolk. Using a pizza wheel or a long sharp knife, cut the dough into 10" long strips that are 1/4" wide. Hold a piece of dough in the middle, and start twisting in the direction of each end; twist until entire piece of dough is tightly coiled. Transfer twist to a baking pan; press the ends to metal. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Bake until the sticks are golden brown, about 8 min. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, and store in an airtight container up to 1 week.

Makes 2 round loaves

Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium and cook for 15-17 minutes or until tender. Drain potatoes, reserving the cooking liquid, and set both aside to cool.

Transfer 1/2 c. lukewarm potato-cooking liquid to breadmaker pan. Add 3 tbs. olive oil, bread flour, whole wheat flour, salt, pepper, thyme and yeast. Process on dough setting. When cycle is complete, turn dough out onto well- floured surface. *Mix diced potatoes into dough until evenly distributed. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise for 30 min. longer.

Sprinkle wooden pizza peel (or back of baking sheet) with cornmeal. Place baking stone on middle rack in oven and preheat to 450. Place dough on well- floured work surface. Divide into two 10"-12" circles. Brush the top of the dough with the remaining 1 tbs. olive oil, cover with sliced potatoes (if desired) and sprinkle lightly with coarse salt, Asiago cheese and more thyme. Transfer to the prepared pizza peel. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for another 15 minutes.

Using spray bottle, spritz the oven walls with water. Work quickly so the oven does not lose heat. Slide the dough onto hot baking stone. Bake for 14-16 minutes, or until bread turns golden brown. Transfer to a rack to cool.

Note: If mixing dough by hand, place potato water and olive oil in large mixer bowl; sprinkle yeast over and allow to sit for 2 minutes. then add flours and mix for 6-8 min. with dough hook or until dough is silky and elastic. Add salt; knead one minute. Add pepper and thyme; knead for 2-3 minutes. Transfer dough to oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place for 1 hour until doubled. Continue at star*.

NOTES : Having enjoyed so many of the bread recipes posted here, I feel it necessary to pay back with one of my family's favorites. Only the dough is made in the bread maker, but it is well worth the shaping and baking after.

Made this the first time in 1997 to go with our cheese-stuffed tortellini, artichoke heart and black olive summer salad. Everybody loved it; the following day we all took cold wedges of it to work for lunch. I didn't add the sliced potatoes on top the first time. The recipe is actually called Potato Focaccia, but it resembles a peasant bread much more, hence the change for our purposes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Rye Blend
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur's Special Bread Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
  1                cup  currants or raisins

In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients except the currants and pecans, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough, by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, till it's smooth and supple, kneading in the currants and pecans during the final couple of minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quiet puffy, though is may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.

Shape the dough into a ball, and place it on a lightly greased sheet pan. Cover the pan with a dough cover, or some lightly greased plastic wrap. Allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it's puffy.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350 degree F oven for about 40 minutes (Tenting it lightly with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes) until its interior registers 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Yield: 1 loaf, about 16 servings.

                International Breads            Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         batch  Amy's Crusty Italian Bread -- see recipe
  3        tablespoons  fresh rosemary -- chopped

A variation on the Crusty Italian Bread

Mix the dough according to the instructions given in the recipe. After the dough has taken its first rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (or overnight) it can be shaped into a fougasse. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a long narrow rectangle. Sprinkle a layer of chopped rosemary over the surface of the dough being careful to cover the edges too. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter, the top third over the middle of the dough, then the bottom third over that, completely overlapping the two. Press the 3 open sides of the fougasse tightly shut. Cover the bread well with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.
Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone.
Sprinkle a peel or upsidedown baking sheet generously with cornmeal and place the fougasse
on top, stretching it slightly to make it into a square. Cut a decorative pattern, such as a leaf or a ladder, into the dough with a dough cutter. Spread and stretch the loaf until the cuts form large openings. Be sure the fougasse is loosened from the peel, then carefully slide it onto the baking stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the bread with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later.
Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaf sounds slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the bread will soften as it cools.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
Yield: 1 fougasse

* (if you use other flour brand, add 2 tbs. vital gluten powder)
** (dry drink mix.  You can use instant coffee, but the Postum adds an additional "grain" flavor.)

Light crust setting.
This step is optional.  Again, I take this from the machine after the last
knead, hand knead in barley flakes and groats.  I like to bake mine in the
oven in the traditional round loaf style if I have time.  But, it may be
returned to the machine and baked.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  toasted saffron threads -- *
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (or 2 scant tablespoons)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 F)
  1              stick  butter -- softened
                        -- (8  tablespoons)
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Vegetable oil
                        Raisins for garnish
                        Melted butter for brushing the tops of
                        the buns
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Makes 20 to 24 buns.

Toasting the saffron threads before steeping them in hot milk gives the bread its intense flavor and rich color.

*Place the saffron in a dry, heavy skillet and toast over medium-high heat for several seconds, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the threads become slightly darker.

Scald the milk in a small pan by bringing it just to a boil and removing it from the heat; then set it aside, add the saffron threads, and allow to cool to lukewarm. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. In a large bowl, combine the milk, yeast, butter, egg, salt, and 3 cups of the flour. Beat the mixture until smooth. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it until smooth. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down and divide it into 24 parts. To make Lucia Buns, lightly form each piece into a rope; place one rope on top of another to form an X. Place a raisin at the end of each X. Put the buns on a greased cookie sheet. Brush the tops with melted butter and allow them to rise until doubled.

Brush the egg-and-water mixture lightly over the buns. Sprinkle the buns with the sugar and bake them in a preheated 350 F oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks.

NOTES : The Swedish name Lussekatter means "Lucia's cats," from the pagan belief that Lucia's light helped send off the evil spirits who, disguised as cats, lurked in dark corners on bleak winter nights. The stylized shape of these open-cross buns is thought to ward off the devil. The dough is also shaped into a braid made to hold candles and used as a centerpiece on the Saint Lucia Day table.

                           Salt Rising Bread #4

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***STARTER***
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        ***BREAD***
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  2          teaspoons  salt
  5               cups  bread flour -- plus up to
  2               cups  flour -- if needed

TO MAKE THE STARTER: Stir cornmeal and sugar blend. Warm milk and mix with cornmeal mixture. Set in a warm spot for 24 hours to allow fermentation. The starter should then have expanded and have a nice odor. If the mix is not light and bubbly, give it another 24 hours or add half a cup of your sourdough starter and set aside in a warm spot for an additional 12 hours. It must be kept warm at all times.

TO MAKE THE BREAD: Pour complete starter, buttermilk, sugar, salt and 3 cups of the flour into a large bowl. Mix thoroughly, cover with plastic wrap, and let ferment an additional 3 to 4 hours, sometimes longer if the area is cool. When it is light and bubbly, add remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

Grease bowl and place dough back in it for a third rising. When about double in bulk, or when a finger hole stays in the dough after it has been pressed, divide dough into two equal pieces. Roll out remaining air in the dough. Shape and place dough into 2 well-greased 9-inch loaf pans, or make 2 round loaves and place on a cookie sheet. Let rise once again until doubled in bulk. Bake in a 375-degree oven for 35 minutes or until loaves are lightly browned and sound hollow when "thunked" with your fingers. Remove from pan and cool bread on wire rack.


Notes: Food News 20 May 1998 <http://www.press-enterprise.com/> Joel "Dutch" Dortch, executive director of Happy Trails Children Foundation in Apple Valley, wrote that he, too, has been looking for salt-rising bread. Dutch grew up in Birmingham, Ala., back in the 1950s, eating salt-rising bread made by a neighborhood deli/bakery. Later in Southern California he bought the bread made by the Van de Kamp's Bakery at Stater Bros. markets. Since Van de Kamp's bakeries went out of business he has been unable to find the bread. Dutch feels many bakeries are missing a great opportunity by not making this bread available. He is certain it makes the best toast of any bread including sourdough, raisin or English muffin. Dutch shares this recipe taken from the current issue of American Cowboy magazine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  potato -- peeled
                        and thinly sliced
  2               cups  boiling water
  2        tablespoons  cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- divided
  2           packages  dry yeast
  1                cup  milk -- scalded
  7               cups  unsifted flour
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda

STARTER: To make the starter place the potato slices in a bowl. Pour the boiling water over the potato slices. Stir in cornmeal, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set the bowl in a warm place (such as gas oven with pilot light on or an electric oven with the interior light on), not covered for about 24 hours to develop the starter.

DOUGH: Strain the starter mixture and discard the potato. Add enough water to make 1 3/4 cups of liquid. Add dry yeast and stir to dissolve. Stir in 3 cups of the flour, milk, oil, 1 teaspoon salt and the baking soda. Beat well. Cover and let rise in a warm place until very light, about 1 hour. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Divide dough in half. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Shape into 2 loaves. Place in greased 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pans. Let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake in a 375-degree oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when rapped with the end of wooden spoon. Turn out of pans onto rack to cool. Makes 2 loaves.


Notes: Food News 20 May 1998 <http://www.press-enterprise.com/> "When I was a young girl my mother and I had Van de Camp's salt-rising bread for breakfast every morning. The last 8 to 10 years we have not been able to find it at any stores. My mom found this recipe that most resembles the Van de Kamp's bread," Kathy Latimer of Riverside wrote in answer to a request made by Betty Smith of Riverside, whose parents used to buy salt-rising bread from Van de Kamp's bakery. Kathy's recipe may not use the old method for making salt-rising bread, but who can question success?

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***STARTER***
  12            ounces  red boiling potatoes -- thinly sliced
                        do not peel, about 2-oz per potato
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  white cornmeal -- water-ground only
  2        tablespoons  flour
  4               cups  boiling water
                        ***SPONGE***
  4               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        ***DOUGH***
     3/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter
  5               cups  flour -- plus
  1                cup  flour -- or as needed

TO MAKE STARTER: Combine the raw potato slices and the salt, sugar, cornmeal and flour in a large bowl. Toss well and pour the boiling water over the mixture. Stir around to to dissolve the dry ingredients. Cover and put in a warm place 15 to 18 hours, until frothy and sour smelling. If you have any doubt, it is not ready. Strain the fermented starter well. Gently press the potatoes but do not break then up or force through the strainer. Discard the potatoes.

TO MAKE THE SPONGE: Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the starter and beat very well. Cover and let rise until doubled. Reserve 1 cup of the sponge and refrigerate for the next batch if you intend to bake again soon. It will not hold more than 2 or 3 days.

TO MAKE THE DOUGH: For the dough, heat together the milk and butter until the butter melts. Reserve 2 tablespoons of this liquid for glazing the loaves. Add the rest of the liquid to the sponge along with the flour. Beat well until a stiff dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead very well, at least 10 minutes.

Divide into 3 loaves and place in greased loaf pans, cover, and let rise about 2 hours or until doubled. Slash the top of the loaves with a very sharp knife, brush with reserved milk/butter mixture, and bake in 400-degree oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for 40 minutes more.

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Hand Made
                Nut & Seed Breads               Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           Cup  sugar
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  2           Packages  active dry yeast
  4 3/4           Cups  all-purpose flour
  4        Tablespoons  margarine or butter -- softened
  2              Large  eggs
  1         Tablespoon  sesame seeds
  1                Cup  water -- warmed

1. In large bowl, combine sugar, salt, yeast, and 1 1/2 cups flour. In 1-quart saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons margarine or
butter (1/2 stick) and 1 cup water until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F.). Margarine or butter does not need to melt completely.

2. With mixer at low speed, gradually beat liquid into dry ingredients just until blended. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula. In cup, refrigerate 1 tablespoon egg white for brushing on rolls later. Into flour mixture in bowl, beat in remaining eggs with 1/2 cup flour to make a thick batter; continue beating 2 minutes, scraping bowl often. With wooden spoon, stir in 2 1/4 cups flour to make a soft dough.

3. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, working in more flour (about 1/2 cup) while kneading. Shape dough into a ball; place in greased large bowl, turning dough to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place (80 to 85 degrees F.) until doubled, about 1 hour.

4. Punch down dough. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Cut dough into 4 pieces; cover and let rest 15 minutes for easier handling.

5. Grease 13" by 9" metal baking pan. In small saucepan, over low heat, melt 1 tablespoon margarine or butter. Roll 1
piece of dough into a 16-inch-long rope. Cut rope into four 4- inch-long rolls. Repeat with remaining dough to make 16 rolls in all. Brush rolls with melted margarine or butter and arrange in pan to make 2 lengthwise rows of 8 rolls
each. Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.

6. Preheat oven to 400 F. Mix reserved egg white
with 1 teaspoon water. Brush rolls with egg-white mixture; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake rolls 15 to 20 minutes until golden and rolls sound hollow when lightly tapped with finger. Cool rolls in pan on wire rack 10 minutes. Place second rack on top of pan; invert rolls onto rack, then invert back onto first rack so rolls are right-side up. Serve rolls warm. Or, cool rolls to serve later. Reheat if desired.

* I used all purpose plus 1T vital wheat gluten after reading their description of Italian style bread which is "between that of a typical American all-purpose flour.....and a pastry flour"

I used by bread machine for mixing, kneading, and the first rise, ie the "dough setting

Removed it from the machine after the first rise and divided into 3 logs, braided and let it rise again. When "doubled and puffy looking" I brushed it with the egg white and at this point it collapsed and did not recover. Sprinkled it with the seeds and baked at 400F for 18 to 20 minutes. It was delicious but dense.

Guess I will try spraying it with water next time and hope the seeds stay on.

Categories    : Bread Machine                   Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  seven-grains cereal
  1 1/2           cups  boiling water
     1/4           cup  honey
  3        tablespoon.  olive oil
  3               cups  bread flour
  1          teaspoon.  salt
  1        tablespoon.  Vital Wheat Gluten
  2          teaspoon.  active dry yeast

Put the cereal in the baking pan and add the boiling water. Let the mush cool to just warm unless your machine has a separate yeast dispenser (like my Panasonic). Add the honey, olive oil, flour, and salt. Top it off with the yeast unless directed otherwise by your machine. Bake on full, whole wheat, or multi-grain cycle. Since it has no eggs or milk, it should do well on an overnight cycle too though I haven't tried this yet (but I will soon).

NOTES : I just cooked a 7 grain cereal bread in my ABM the other night. It turned out great. The whole family loved it.

I used 7-grain Hot Cereal from Arrow Head Mills which I found in the 'organic' foods section of a local (and big) grocery store. The recipe is an adaptation.

Here's a recipe for one of my family's favorite rolls. Whenever there's a family gathering, everyone looks for Karen's rolls. Been making these for about 4 years, I think the recipe came from the internet.

                        gluten)
  2               Tbsp  gluten
  1 1/2            tsp  kosher salt
                        -- (you could use 2 tsp)
     1/3           cup  lukewarm water -- (1/3 to 1/2)

Put the starter in the bowl of a heavy duty mixer with dough hook. Drizzle in the sticky, gooey malt syrup. Mix thoroughly at slow speed. Mix together the flour, gluten and salt.
Add to the starter mixture and mix at slow speed until it is a shaggy mess. Add 1/4 cup water while mixing; keep adding more a little bit at a time until the flour is almost all incorporated. Raise speed a notch and add a little more water as necessary to make a stiff, plastic dough. The dough will weigh 2 pounds when ready.

Turn out on your kneading surface and knead until completely smooth. Little or no flour should be required to keep it from sticking. Form into a ball and let it rest, covered with a floured towel for about 15 minutes. Keep the dough you are not working on covered with the towel while you cut the ball in half, then quarters and eighths. You will have 8 equal triangular bits of dough. Keep them covered while you take out one at a time and shape it into a ball. Put that one back under the towel and do the next one. After all the balls are shaped let them rest while you prepare the pan or pans they will rise in.

I use two STRAIGHT SIDED 9 inch cake pans which I can stack without the top one nesting into the lower one. This is because of limited horizontal space in my refrigerator.
You could use one large rectangular pan or baking dish, just so it has sides about 2 inches deep. Dust the bottom with about a tsp or so of semolina. And have some plastic wrap ready to cover it.

Shape the balls into bagel shapes. You can do this by rolling them out into ropes about 10 or 11 inches long, without tapering the ends, then overlapping and pinching the ends and rolling against the kneading surface with your hand in the hole until it is well sealed and uniformly thick. I find this tedious and prefer to poke a hole in the center of the ball and stretch it into shape. This makes less perfect looking bagels, but once they are covered with a topping, no one is the wiser. If I were baking them plain, I would use the rope method.

Place each in the pan(s), leaving plenty of space between them. You don't ever want them to touch as they rise because it will be difficult to cut them apart without deflating and mishaping them. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap so it will never touch the bagels. Refrigerate for 12-15 hours. They will not appear to have risen much at all.

Remove pans from fridge and leave them, covered, in cool place for another couple hours, until they are puffy. To test for readiness, drop one in a bowl of cool water. It should float. If not, wait longer and test again.

Meanwhile, prepare your boiling water; preheat your oven, with tiles or stone, to 450 degrees; and prepare your toppings. You will need at least three inches of rapidly boiling water in a large pot and a skimmer or flat strainer, also cake racks and a peel.

Put your toppings in soup bowls. I like to use sesame seeds with a pinch of kosher salt. A mixture of sesame, a pinch of kosher salt, a little poppy and some sunflower seeds is good.
You can also add caraway, fennel, cumin, whatever; or start with one and add others after dipping some bagels so you end up with a variety. The seeds will stick easily to the freshly boiled bagels. Onion and/or garlic topping needs to be handled differently, more about that later.

I boil one at a time; any more creates the danger of over boiling. Drop one bagel into the boiling water and press it under the water with the skimmer. Boil for 20 or 30 seconds, just until the dough becomes a little puffy. Remove with the skimmer and flip it into the bowl of seeds top side down. I use a chopstick in the hole to remove the bagel otherwise I end up with burnt and sticky fingers. Place the bagel on the cake rack. When all are boiled, wait a minute or two for the last ones to dry a little. Steam the oven while you're waiting.
Then transfer them all to a semolina dusted peel for deposit onto the tiles or stone. Bake for about 15 minutes. Remove with peel and cool on racks.

For onion topping: Thinly slice an onion or two and cut into little pieces, not too long, but not chopped or square either. Saute in a little olive oil until soft but not brown. Mix with as much poppy seed as you want. Just before topping the bagels, add a little kosher salt. I make this topping right after I put the dough into the refrigerator and let it sit out to dry a little during the 12 hours the bagels are in the fridge. Because of the oil, the onions won't stick like seeds do; so pat the onion topping onto the bagels while they rest on the racks (after boiling and before baking.)

Blueberry bagels could be made by adding chopped DRIED blueberries to the
flour. I think 1/2 cup would be right. I have not tried this.



                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : I thought I made great bagels, but I just modified my recipe to use sourdough and they are even greater now--lighter but still very chewy.

Here's my recipe: Don't try to double it, if you value your mixer.

Don't let the length of this recipe deter you; it is really easy and not time consuming at all.
Once you have gone through it, you will have the routine down. I can, and probably have, done them in my sleep. I never buy bagels anymore, mine are as good as, if not better than, the best bakery bagels (which by the way are NOT Noah's.)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        The day before:
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                cup  sourdough starter
     2/3           cup  milk
                        ---
                        The morning of:
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  shortening

Place the shortening in the freezer the night before.

This is perfect for the food processor, using the dough blade.

The day before:
Stir together 1/2 cup flour, sugar, sourdough starter and milk in non-metal mixing bowl until smooth. Cover loosely with waxed paper and let stand in a warm place (80-85 degrees) at least 18 hours.

The morning of:
Stir batter down. Stir together 2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Blend in starter mixture. Add more flour if necessary to make a soft dough. Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 30 seconds. Roll out 1/2-inch thick. Cut out biscuits with floured cutter. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake in preheated 450 degree oven 10-12 minutes.

NOTES : This morning I just learned another neat thing about this recipe. The last time I made biscuits, I didn't need as many as the recipe makes. So, I placed the cut biscuits (unbaked) on a cookie sheet and froze them. When frozen, I put them in a Ziploc bag in the freezer. Today, I took out as many as I needed, and put them, still frozen, in the preheated oven. They still raised up nice and golden.


4. When starter is ready it is bubbly and spongy looking and has a good sour aroma. Starter should be kept in the refrigerator after this five day period.

5. To use starter bring to room temperature and allow it to get bubbly again before using it.

6. Replenish starter after each use with equal portions of milk and flour. Example: If using 1 1/2 cups add 1 1/2 cups each: milk & flour.

7. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3.

Use the 1-pound recipe if your machine pan holds 10 cups or less of water. Add ingredients to bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. (If dough is too dry or stiff or too soft or slack, adjust dough consistency - see Adjusting Dough Consistency tip below.) Recommended cycle: Basic/white bread cycle; medium/normal color setting. Timed-bake feature can be used.

*Sourdough Bread Baking Tips:
The sourdough starter should be the consistency of thin pancake batter; if necessary add enough water to get the desired consistency before measuring.

To assure accuracy, measure the starter while it's chilled, then let it come to room temperature before using it. (The starter will expand as it warms
up.)
Before trying the timed-bake feature, make a loaf using the basic/white bread cycle to better determine the amount of liquid and flour needed for the right dough consistency.

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips
                Starter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  skim milk
  3        Tablespoons  plain yogurt

SOURDOUGH STARTER

1. Heat 1 cup skim (nonfat) milk to 90F to 100F.

2. Stir in 3 tablespoons plain, fresh, high quality yogurt.

3. Pour mixture into a 1-quart glass or ceramic crock, jar,
or bowl. Cover with a non-metallic lid; set in a warm place (between 70F to 100F) for 24 hours. On a warm day you can place the starter outside in the sun or on the kitchen counter. On cooler days, place it in a gas oven with a pilot light, on top of the water heater, or on a heating pad set on low.

4. After 24 hours, the milk will thicken and form curds. At
this point, gradually stir in 1 cup white flour until well blended. Cover with lid and set in a warm place again until it ferments and bubbles and a clear liquid forms on top, about 2 to 5 days. Stir daily.

5. Starter is now ready to use. Stir, cover loosely, and
refrigerate.

IF AT ANY POINT IN THE PROCESS THE STARTER TURNS PINK, SMELLS RANCID (NOT JUST SOUR), OR DEVELOPS A MOLD, THROW IT OUT AND START OVER.


REPLENISHING THE STARTER

Every time you use some of the starter you must replace it with a like amount of milk and flour. For instance, if you use 1 cup of starter, return 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of flour to the jar. Follow the directions for feeding the starter.

FEEDING THE STARTER TO KEEP IT ALIVE AND HEALTHY

A starter should be used as often as possible, at least every 2 to 3 weeks. If you are not using it that often, plan to feed it once a month to keep it going.

1. Bring the starter to room temperature. (You can place it
in a bowl of warm water to speed the process.)

2. Add equal amounts of warm milk (90F to 100F) and flour
(1/2 to 1 cup each)

3. Cover with lid and allow to stand in a warm place (70F
to 100F) for 12 to 24 hours until bubbly and a clear liquid has formed on top.

4. Stir, cover loosely (set lid on jar but do not tightly
seal; gases must be allowed to escape), and refrigerate.


REJUVENATING A NEGLECTED STARTER

If you forget to feed your starter monthly, don't throw it
away thinking it's gone bad.  Chances are you can still
revive it.

1. Pour off the liquid and discard all but 1 to 2
tablespoons of the starter. Temporarily place reserved starter in a bowl.

2. Wash out the starter container with hot water.

3. Put the starter back into the container.

4. Follow the directions for feeding the starter using 1 cup
warm (90F to 100F) nonfat milk and 1 cup flour.

5. You may have to repeat this procedure once or twice to
bring it back up to a bubbly, sour smelling starter again.


SOURDOUGH FACTS TO KEEP IN MIND

. Use only wooden utensils and glass or ceramic containers.
The acid in the starter will corrode any metal with which it comes in contact.
. Store loosely covered in the refrigerator; do not put in a
tightly sealed container. The gases must be allowed to escape.
. The yellowish or grayish-beige liquid that rises to the
top is the "hooch". Just stir it back in before measuring out starter for a recipe.
. You can refresh your starter once a year or so with a few
tablespoons of fresh, plain, good quality yogurt. . For the sourest taste when making bread, mix the room
temperature starter with the liquid and half the flour called for in the recipe. Cover and allow to stand in a warm place until bubbly and sour smelling, about 12 to 24 hours. At that point, combine the mixture in the bread machine with the rest of the ingredients in the recipe. . Your starter can be frozen up to 3 months. Before using
it again, let it thaw completely at room temperature for 24 hours until bubbly. You may need to feed it once to bring it back to the bubbly stage after freezing.

                          Sourdough Starter Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

After you put a live starter in the fridge it will separate into two components. The gray looking liquid on top is the alcohol which was formed in the fermentation process. It was called "hooch" by the miners in Alaska and the Yukon and some miners were known to drink the stuff after their supply of whiskey ran out and they had nothing else alcoholic to drink. The white stuff on the bottom is the residue of the flour after the protein has been fermented out.

All you have to do is stir your starter up real good and combine a small portion of of it with flour and water. Allow it to ferment at about 85 degrees until it is all bubbly and sour smelling and your starter is ready to bake with again.


The method I use is as follows:
Stir the old starter up real good and place one tablespoon of it in a small bowl along with 1/2 cup of 85 degree water and 1/2 cup of flour. Beat vigorously to incorporate lots of air. After about 7 or 8 hours it should be bubbling real good so double it. In other words, add 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of flour beating again as before. After about 7 or 8 hours it should be bubbling again so once more double it by adding 1 cup of water and 1 cup of flour. Just keep on doubling your starter until you have enough to bake with. I usually start preparing the starter a day ahead of my baking day so the last fermenting will take place over night and I can bake first thing in the morning using the 2 cups of starter that were produced. I then take one tablespoon of starter from the new batch and place it in a small jar along with 1/2 cup of 85 degree water and 1/2 cup of flour. Beat it well and allow that to ferment for 8 hours then chuck the jar of new starter in the fridge. After a few days it will separate as you have already discovered but it is still good. An alternate to this last step could be to just make a little more starter than you actually need for your baking, measure out the amount you need in your recipe and save the rest for your next project.

By the way, I never keep the old starter after using it to create a new batch for baking. I just keep producing new starter. I know this method sounds a little involved and time consuming, but it guarantees you the freshest and most vigorous starter possible every time you bake and that's really crucial to successful sourdough baking.

  1                tsp  salt

(Makes one 1 1/2 lb. loaf)


Place ingredients in bread pan per ABM manual. Add handful of raisins, nuts, whatever at the "beep."

NOTES : I've never made bread using soy products, but when making *any* bread in the ABM, it's important to bear in mind the solids-to-liquid ratio. I use 1 1/4 c. liquid to 3 - 4 cups flour.

               Spiced Pear, Date, Oat And Whole Wheat Bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            cup  pears -- whirled to death
                        into mush in the Cuisinart
                        -- (ok ok - I pureed 4 pears)
  1         tablespoon  oil
                        -- (cold expelled extra virgin olive oil)
  1         tablespoon  honey
  4                cup  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  oats
  2          teaspoons  gluten, wheat
  3           teaspoon  yeast
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  2           teaspoon  cinnamon
  2           teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  chopped dates

My dates were whole with the pit in them, so i chopped them in the Cuisinart. What i did was to sprinkle them with the cinnamon and nutmeg so they wouldn't all stick together on the blade. I figured they were dusted enough and I put them on the very top of the flour. I am just not one to wait for the beep. So in about 4:10 hours, i should know if this worked or not. I am aiming for a 2 lb loaf since my machine can handle that size. This was redicated on the need to either use the pears or watch 'em rot before I got them all eaten. hence making a virtue of a necessity.

NOTES : I went off to Bookstar and had me a gander at THE BREAD MACHINE MAGIC BOOK OF HELPFUL HINTS as recommended to me by Daby and written by Linda Rehberg and Lois Conway. I was stunned by a number of references to San Diego, where I reside in the Land of Perfect Weather. I was also surprised to see a recipe by Jim Bodle who was a regular poster on the Home hearth Food Digest and I mostly remember him for his love affair with Spam (the so-called meat product, not junk email).

So I sorta took bits and pieces of this recipe and that and aimed at an overall right proportion of wet to dry and I'll let ya know later how it came out.

                            Spicy Spiral Bread

Recipe By     :King Arthur's Baker's Catalog, winter, 1998

                Vegetable & Herb Breads         Want To Try


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  yellow cornmeal
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  chipotle or red chili powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Filling:
  16            ounces  refried beans
  8             ounces  shredded Monterey jack cheese
  1         tablespoon  Mexican bread topping -- *
                        -- (1-3 tablespoons)



* use the lesser amount for mild flavor, more for hot

Optional filling add-ins include 1/2 cup diced raw onion, sliced black olives, diced jalapeno peppers, 1/4 cup salsa, chopped fresh cilantro, or 1/2 cup cooked and drained ground beef. If you use more than three of the preceding options, you'll probably have leftover filling (which is delicious served in taco shells or burritos). The filling should be firm, and should total around 2 cups altogether.

Dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, yeast, salt, chili powder, sugar, olive oil and water. Mix until a rough dough forms, then knead: 10 minutes by hand, about 8 minutes by machine. The dough is soft;
work with it gently. Turn the dough into a greased bowl, cover it, and lit it rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until it's doubled in bulk.

To prepare the dough in a bread machine, place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your machine according to the manufacturer's instructions, and program the machine for Dough or Manual. Let the machine complete its cycle.

Assembly: Roll the dough into a long, 8 x 24-inch rectangle. Spread it with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the filling. leaving a 1-9inch margin along the edges. Fold in the two short ends, and roll the dough into a 24-inch log. Pinch the dough to seal it well.

Keeping the seam side down, ease the log, in a loose spiral, into a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Pat the spiral down so it's flat and even across the top. Cover the dough and let it rise till it's even with the top of the pan or slightly crowned above the lip of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 45 to 50 minutes, till golden brown. Serve warm, hot or cold, with a salad, if desired. Yield: 8 large servings, 10 medium servings.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg

                              Sponge Starter

Recipe By     :BAKERS' DOZEN AMY SCHERBER SHOW #BD1A53
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Starter


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  very warm water -- (12 ounces)
                        -- (105 to 115 degrees)
     1/4      teaspoon  active dry yeast
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (16 ounces)
                        -- 2-quart clear plastic container

Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat elastic batter has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options:

If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It's best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much.

If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but don't let it collapse to much before you use it.

It tastes the closest to store-bought wheat bread with the denser texture of machine made.

Traditional Greek bread usually served with 1 coin hidden inside which superstition says bestows luck upon the finder. Do not add a coin to your machine but you may add a single raisin at the beep. This is a delicious sweet bread and makes wonderful sandwiches. This is really one of our favorites.

Recipe originally from "Kay L. Hitchcock" <HITCHCOC_K@popmail.firn.edu> to The TNT Recipes List.
~~~~
Because of the milk and eggs in the recipe it is not recommended that you use the delayed bake option.

Set the bread machine for Sweet Bread (8 for an Oster machine). Add ingredients according to the recommendation of the machine.

When I made this, I had no lemons, so I used orange peel. It tastes great with the orange peel. I will have to try it with lemon some day.

                Rolls                           Sweet Breads & Cakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  2 1/4      teaspoons  instant yeast
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  warm water
     1/4           cup  non-instant nonfat dry milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        Filling:
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
                        Glaze:
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1                cup  chopped pecans
     1/2           cup  sticky bun sugar -- **  mixed with
     1/2           cup  brown sugar

Dough: In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, till it's smooth and supple. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point. It should be soft and slightly sticky. Put it into a well greased bowl, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.

Shaping and filling: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or oiled work surface, and roll it into a 16 x 12-inch rectangle. Spread the dough with 2 tablespoons soft butter and sprinkle with the cinnamon mixture. Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a 16-inch log. Slice the log into 16 pieces.

Glaze: Spread the melted butter in a 12-inch square pan, 14-inch round pan, or two 9-inch round pans. Sprinkle with the pecans, then the sugar mixture. place the buns in the prepared pan, cut sides down. Cover the pan and allow the buns to rise till doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Bake the sticky buns in a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, tenting them with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes to prevent over-browning. Remove the buns from the oven and invert them onto a cooling rack. Scrape any of the sticky topping that has remained in the pan onto the buns. Yield: 16 sticky buns.

**Sticky bun sugar is a combination of glucose, dextrose and vegetable oil sold by King Arthur

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Hand Made
                International Breads            White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  500            grams  Bread flour
  2 1/2          grams  Ascorbic Acid -- (optional)
  175            grams  Iced Water
  7 1/2          grams  Dry instant yeast
  5              grams  Salt
  100            grams  Sugar
  50             grams  Butter
  50             grams  Shortening
  30             grams  Fresh Milk
  100            grams  Egg yolks

1. Using part of the water from the recipe, combine it with the yeast and 50 grams of the sugar. Set aside.

2. Using the dough hook attachment of your machine mix together the bread flour and remaining sugar.

3. Pour in the yeast mixture, continue mixing at slow speed. Add water and milk in a thin stream until mixture looks completely wet. Add more water as necessary.

4. Increase the speed and add in the butter and shortening in pieces until mixture looks completely lubricated. Add egg yolks then the salt. Continue mixing at high speed until dough leaves the sides of the bowl clean.

5. Continue mixing until gluten is developed. Test the dough by getting a small piece and stretching it, it should not break easily and should feel elastic. The dough will be VERY sticky.

6. Rest the dough in a large greased bowl (turning dough once to grease top). Cover with plastic. Do not disturb for about 30 minutes.

7. At this point you can shape the dough into anything you want. For Filipino Ensaimada: Divide the dough into two. Divide each half into 50 gram pcs. Roll up each dough tightly into a bun. Place in a greased tray, cover with greased plastic and set aside for 10 minutes. Roll each dough into a rectangle and slather generously with butter. Cover the entire surface with grated cheese (edam works excellently) and roll up on the long side into a thin baton. Coil this baton into a tight cinnamon bun shape and place in round, greased fluted molds OR in large muffin tins. Butter the tops and set aside to let it rise until double. This might take between 1 to 2 hours (depending on the temperature of your kitchen - for faster rising, place inside an empty cabinet).

8. Just before baking brush tops GENTLY with egg beaten with a few tablespoons of water. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F oven for approximately 18 to 25 minutes. Tops should be just golden. Because the dough is so rich the bread will turn brown easily.

9. Remove immediately to cooling racks. Brush with more butter and sprinkle with a little sugar and more grated cheese.

NOTES : This is my first time to post in this list, so please bear with me :) I don't own a bread machine and usually just bake bread by hand when I'm at home. I used to work for a food ingredients company that sells (among other things) bread improvers for the local baking industry. This recipe was a favorite of ours and I've scaled it down considerably. I don't know how to make it in a bread machine, but for those with a Hobart mixer, there should be no problems with it. I've demonstrated this bread many times and people usually ask me for the recipe. It's very versatile and can be shaped into almost anything you wish, plus, the dough, although very rich, can accommodate addition of other ingredients.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      envelopes  yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  warm water -- for the yeast
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  walnut oil
  2               cups  pecans -- see directions
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- PLUS
  1 1/2           cups  flour -- as needed
  8              large  whole pecans -- for garnish
  1                     egg yolk -- mixed with
  2          teaspoons  water -- for glazing

WHOLE PECANS, light toast or dry-pan roast the pecans. Cool completely. Reserve 8 for garnish. Grind in a good processor and measure as indicated.

Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Stir in the salt, walnut oil, and ground nuts. Add the first measure of flour and stir into the water. Add additional flour as necessary to form a dough that is firm enough to turn out of the bowl onto a floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is elastic, soft, but not sticky. (About 6 to 7 minutes.)

Place the dough in an oiled bowl (walnut oil would again be nice). Cover with a towel, place in a warm place, and let rise for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 loaves and place each in an oiled 4-1/2X8-1/2 inch bread pan. Cover with a towel and allow to rise again for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the dough mounds slightly over the rim of the pans. Preheat the oven to 375F.

Brush the loaves with the egg yolk glaze. Arrange 4 pecans decoratively at the center of each loaf. Bake for 50 minutes. Cool. Cut into thick slices and use as toast.

  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds

In small bowl, stir together yeast, water, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons flour. Set mixture aside until bubbly, about 10 minutes.

In large mixing bowl beat 3 eggs. Mix In remaining sugar, remaining salt, cooled scalded milk and cooled melted butter. Stir in yeast mixture and vanilla. Mix in enough of remaining flour to form stiff elastic dough.

NOTES : I don't bake Easter eggs into my tsoureki because I don't care for the red dye that bleeds into the bread. So that the wreath doesn't bake shut, grease a small metal or oven-proof glass bowl, pit it in the center of the baking sheet and place the wreath around the bowl.

  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        warm water

The original recipe produced eight babkas; this recipe is adapted for a single loaf. Bake the babka in a clean 3 pound coffee can or a large kugelhopf mold.

Bring 1/3 cup milk to boil and gradually add to 2 tablespoons flour, beating thoroughly until smooth. Set aside. Dissolve I teaspoon of the sugar in the lukewarm water, then mix in yeast and stir until the yeast is completely dissolved. Stir in milk-flour mixture. Mix well. Cover mixture and st aside in warm place until light and bubbly, about 10 minutes.

In large mixing bowl beat together until light the egg yolks, 1 egg, remaining sugar and salt. Beat in melted butter, vanilla and citrus zest. Add yeast mixture; mix well. Stir in enough remaining flour to form very soft dough. Knead dough in bowl 15 minutes. Sprinkle raisins over dough and very gently knead raisins into dough. Cover bowl and let dough rise in warm place until doubled, about 2 hours.

Punch down risen dough, knead slightly, cover and let rise again until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Generously butter 3-pound coffee can or large kugelhopf pan. Coat pan with fine bread crumbs. Place dough in pan, cover and let rise in warm place until dough reaches brim of pan, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly beat remaining egg with 2 tablespoons milk and brush over top of dough. Bake bread for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake for 30 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 275 degrees and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. (If necessary, cover bread with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning.)

Let bread cool in pan 10 minutes. Very gently tip bread from pan onto layers of soft cloth. (Bread may collapse if handled roughly, or If cooled on hard surface.) Cool bread completely.

Stir together 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Add enough warm water to form glaze. Ice cool bread with lemon glaze. Makes 1 babka.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  milk -- warmed
     1/4           Cup  butter or margarine
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  3               Cups  bread flour -- or less, see note
  1            Package  dry yeast
                        ***ADDITIONS***
     1/2           Cup  finely chopped red onions
     3/4           Cup  chopped walnuts

MAKES 2 baguettes or 1 standard loaf.

STANDARD LOAF: [1] Add butter to warm melt stir to melt. Place in the bread bin. Add sugar, salt, flour, and yeast (in that order). Set machine for 1-1/2-lb standard loaf (light or medium crust).

[2] During the second kneading, add onion. When that is incorporated, start adding the nuts, a third at a time -- or wait for the machine's signal to add nuts.

SHAPED LOAVES: Proceed with step [1] above BUT reduce flour to 2+3/4 cups and use the dough cycle. [2] Remove dough to a floured board; punch down and knead in the onions and walnuts until evenly distributed. Cut in two, and shape into long, thin loaves (BAGUETTES) about 1-1/2 inches thick. Let stand 45 minutes uncovered in a warm draft-free spot. Place the loaves on parchment paper on baking sheets and bake at 400 degrees about 25 to 30 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.

REVIEW: Very tasty bread with good texture. Recipe was translated for the machine and tested. Original recipe calls for 2+3/4 cups plus flour for kneading. Tested with butter; and again with margarine (not lowfat).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  bread flour
  2 1/2         pounds  whole wheat flour
  2 1/4           cups  seven grain cereal
  270               mL  Brown Sugar -- (compacted)
  405               mL  Wheat Gluten
  35                mL  Salt
                        -- (2 Tbsp. + 1 Tsp.)
  270               mL  Bread Enhancer -- *
                        ---
  3 1/2           cups  the mix -- (see above)
     3/8           cup  milk
                        -- (I may substitute powdered milk some
                        time)
     3/4           cup  water
  1 1/2           tbsp  olive oil
  1               tbsp  yeast

The recipe I used was modified from Carris' Wheat Bread found on page 36 of The Bread Machine Cookbook III by Donna German. I got a 2-gallon plastic paint bucket and lid from Home Depot, and uncerimoniously dumped the contents of a 5-lb sack of white bread flour into it. I then weighed 2.5 lbs of whole wheat flour and added it to the bucket. I then weighed 3 cups of the mix and found that it weighed 385 grams (0.85 lbs). 7.5 lbs. of flour mix translates to 3405 grams, which, when divided by 385 grams means that that 7.5 lbs of flour mix will make 8.8 loaves. Call it 9. I did. I then multiplied the remaining ingredients by 9 to get the amounts to add. In order to use a measuring cup for measuring the remaining ingredients, I converted the British units to metric, using 5 mL for each Tsp, and 15 mL for each Tbsp.

Since my measuring cups, and yours (don't deny it), are graduated in both British and metric units, I use whichever system best fits my calculations, so excuse the mixture of units. To the flour mix in the bucket I then added:

2.25 cups 7-grain Cereal
270 mL Brown Sugar, (compacted)
405 mL Wheat Gluten
35 mL Salt
- (2 Tbsp. + 1 Tsp.)
270 mL Bread Enhancer,*

*Made from 1 cup lecithin granules, 2 Tbsp. citric acid**, 1 Tbsp. ground ginger

** I used Fresh Fruit Protector, made by Ball, found with the mason jars, pectin, etc. in the local supermarket. It consists of an unspecified mixture of citric acid, ascorbic acid and sugar.

I then took the bucket out in the garage and mixed the dry ingredients using my cordless drill with an auger-type paint mixer (clean, of course and never used to mix lead-containing paint).

Done! Snap lid on to bucket so almost-2-year-old Emily-Claire can't get into it.

Now for the fun part.  Measure out:
3.5 cups of the mix and add
3/8 cup milk
- (I may substitute powdered milk some time)
3/4 cup water
1.5 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp yeast

. . . and push the button.

Now when I want to make my weekly loaf, I just measure out the above ingredients, push the button and get on with life.

NOTES : The bread has a light texture and is somewhat sweet. Emily got the top, which is the fluffiest part, of the first loaf. She looked up at me and said her most complex sentence yet, "I like this bread." That's good enough for me.

Over the past few years, I have found myself making a light whole-wheat bread mostly for sandwiches, and thought it might save me some time if I could "batch" the mix. I like eating home-made bread, and let's face it, using an ABM is a pretty mechanical process, in order to save myself time, here's how I proceeded.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4            cup  water
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  shortening -- butter or margarine
                        ---
                        Combine in mixing bowl:
  1                cup  oatmeal
                        -- (old-fashioned or quick-cooking)
  2           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
                        -- or one package
  3                cup  all-purpose flour -- or bread flour
  1                cup  dry milk
                        optional ingredients: -- *
     1/4           cup  oat bran
     1/4           cup  wheat bran
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
     1/4           cup  vital wheat gluten
                        -- (may use one- some - or all)

* (if you don't have them, leave them out and add more flour in the kneading).

Combine the first ingredients and heat in microwave on high for 2 minutes or on the stove until the shortening/butter melts: (should be very warm, but cool enough to hold one's finger in the liquid)

Add hot water mixture to flour mixture and beat thoroughly.

Gradually add more flour until dough is kneadable (about 3 c). (Total amount of flour is about 6 1/2 cups).

Knead on well-floured surface until dough is not sticky but still a little tacky. Let rise in covered greased bowl in warm place until double. Punch down, form into two (2) loaves and place in greased bread pans (9" x 5" or 8"x 4"), and let rise, covered, until double again.

Uncover, place in oven and set oven for 350 degrees F. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until golden brown, loaves sound hollow when tapped, and/or the internal temperature of the bread on an instant-read thermometer is 200 degrees F. If tops of loaves brown too fast, tent them loosely with aluminum foil. Remove from pans when done and let cool completely on a wire rack.

Slice, eat and enjoy!

Option for this bread: Decrease water to 1 3/4 cups and add 2 eggs, lightly beaten, when combining the liquid and dry ingredients. You may need to adjust the amount of flour to get the right texture.

NOTES : I have been developing and fine-tuning the following recipe for years.  I figure is is time to share the recipe with the world!

This can be considered a simplified version of "Ruth's Daily Bread," http://www.upword.com/bread/daily.html using ingredients that the average home cook should either already have at home, or can easily get at a local market (except perhaps the optional ingredients, which I want to stress are optional).

                Hand Made                       White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               cup.  milk
  2                 T.  vegetable shortening
                        -- or softened unsalted butter
  3                 t.  salt
  2              Tbsp.  lemon juice
  1               cup.  lukewarm water -- minus 2 Tbsp.
  2                 T.  quick-rise yeast
  2                 T.  sugar
  6               cup.  bread flour -- approximately (6 to
                        -- 7)
  2                 T.  butter -- melted

Warm the milk in a saucepan to soften the shortening or butter for a few moments. Add the salt, lemon juice, and the lukewarm water.

In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 c. flour and yeast and beat for 3 minutes at medium speed in an electric mixer. Gradually add 2 more cups flour, and continue beating for 3 minutes.

Turn off the mixer and add about 2 more cups flour. Work it in until the dough becomes stiff. Knead for about 8-9 minutes with dough hook.

Divide dough in half and shape the balls. Let rest under a cloth for 5 minutes to allow dough to relax. Form the loaves by pressing each into an oval, roughly the length of the baking pan. Fold the oval in half, pinch the seam tightly to seal, tuck under the ends, and place seam down in the pan. Brush the loaves with melted butter.

Place pans in a warm, draft-free location. Cover with tea towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes (hence, the recipe name).

Place pans in cold oven, turn to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for 45 minutes or until loaves are brown. When done, they will sound hollow when tapped on the bottom with a forefinger. If the crust is soft, return to the oven without the pans for approximately 10 minutes. If using a convection oven, temperature should be dropped by 50 degrees.

Place loaves on racks to cool thoroughly.

This bread freezes very well.

                Hand Made                       White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  very warm water -- (2 ounces)
                        -- (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
  1 3/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (20 1/4 ounces)
  2 1/4      teaspoons  Kosher salt
  1 1/4           cups  cool water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cool water -- (11 ounces)
                        -- ( 75 degrees)

In a small measuring cup, mix the warm water and yeast with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the cool water. Using your fingers, mix the dough into a sticky mass.

When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. The dough should be sticky and will not look smooth. If the dough feels stiff or dry, knead in additional cool water, a tablespoon at a time.
Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes.

Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to 8 minutes. The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will become supple but not too firm.

Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.) Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges. Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up, overlapping them slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and fold the top down and the bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape the dough into a log shape by rolling the loaf down two to three times and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Roll the loaf back and forth on the table to smooth out. Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5 inch loaf pan. Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the pan, and cover it with oiled plastic wrap.

Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge of the pan. Meanwhile preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then shut the oven door. After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again.

Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees and bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden brown. Remove the loaf from the pan it should come out with ease. The bread should sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the sides of the loaf should be brown. Immediately place the loaf from the pan on a wire rack to cool. Serve slightly warm, with butter and lots of homemade jam!

Yield: one 2 pound loaf

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
     3/4          cups  dry milk powder
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1                cup  Crisco -- (See notes below)
  1                tsp  salt

Mix all ingredients together. Makes 8 cups of mix. Store in air-tight container.

Biscuits: 3 cups mix, 1 cup water. Mix well. Divide into 16 biscuits. Use greased baking sheet and bake at 425 for 10-12 minutes. (Recipe may be halved)

Pizza crust: 1 Tbsp yeast, dissolved in 1/2 cup hot water. Add 2 1/4 cups mix. Knead on floured surface. Let rise 10 minutes. Spread on greased pizza pan sprinkled with cornmeal. Bake at 425 for 10 minutes, then add sauce and toppings of choice. Return to oven and bake until hot and the cheese is melted.

**NOTES: You can substitute and use ALL whole wheat flour.

About Crisco, I despise it, all those hydrogenated and saturated fats...*yuch*,
so I use butter, but I have to store it in the fridge. I have used with cup for cup for Bisquick and it turns out pretty well.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/8           cups  warm water
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
     1/3           cup  dry milk
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1 1/3         ounces  butter -- or margarine
  1                cup  white flour
  2               cups  flour, whole-grain wheat

This recipe is scaled for large bread machines. I recommend using the dough cycle and baking the bread in an oven.

Put the ingredients into the bread machine and mix on the dough cycle. The bread should be a little soft and sticky after the first knead, but whole wheat flour will take up extra water as it rises.

At the end of the dough cycle, remove the bread dough and put it on a lightly floured surface. Shape into about 4 small loaves, about 6 inches in diameter on greased cookie sheets or oiled planks. Let rise until doubled (this bread has a small amount of yeast in it and may rise slowly).
Cut a cross in the top of the loaves and allow to rise an additional 10-15 minutes. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes and reduce the heat to 325 for another 15 minutes.

Each loaf will serve 30-50 communicants. The bread freezes well sealed in plastic bags.

NOTES : We have used for church (Episcopal). We generally make loaves about the size of a small hamburger bun. The size is convenient for moderate sized groups, and more than one piece can be used for larger occasions. These freeze well and store until needed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  very warm water -- (2 ounces)
                        -- (105 to 115 degrees F)
  3 3/4           cups  organic whole wheat flour -- (18 1/2 ounces)
                        -- or more if necessary
  2 3/4           cups  organic unbleached all-purpose flour -- (12 1/2 ounces)
  2               cups  organic old-fashioned rolled oats -- (6 ounces)
  2        tablespoons  Kosher salt -- (3/4 ounce)
  1 1/2           cups  Sponge Starter -- (12 ounces)
                        see recipe
  2 1/2           cups  cool water -- (20 ounces)
                        -- ( 75 degrees F)
  3        tablespoons  honey -- (1 1/2 ounces)
  3        tablespoons  molasses -- (1 1/2 ounces )
  2        tablespoons  Canola oil -- (1 ounce)
                        -- (or other vegetable oil)
  2               cups  pecan pieces -- (8 ounces) toasted
                        Additional rolled oats for topping
                        Two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans -- oiled

Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for about 3 minutes. Whisk the whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, oats, and salt together in a medium bowl.

Add the sponge starter, cool water, honey, molasses, and oil to the yeast mixture. Mix with your fingers for 1 to 2 minutes, just long enough to break up the sponge (the mixture should look milky and be slightly foamy). Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Don't be concerned if the dough feels very sticky at this point.

Lightly flour a work surface. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, until it becomes compact and elastic. It should be very moist but not mushy. If it feels too stiff to knead, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have a soft, malleable dough. If it's sloppy wet and impossible to knead, add another 1/4 to 1/3 cup (1 1/4 to 1 2/3 ounces) of whole wheat
flour. Shape the dough into a loose ball and let it rest, covered with plastic wrap, on the lightly floured work surface for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)

Flatten the dough and stretch it gently into a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the pecans and raisins evenly over the dough. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead and fold it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading. Some of the nuts may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the dough has softened.
Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose nuts. Turn the dough to coat the top with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (You can also refrigerate this dough overnight and shape it and bake it the next day: Let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature, or until it looks slightly puffy but not doubled, before refrigerating. The next day, let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature before shaping it.)

When the dough has doubled, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured hands and gently pour it onto a floured work surface. Press any loose pecans into the dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a log. Spread the oats for topping on a flat plate or baking sheet. Use a pastry brush or a plant sprayer to lightly moisten the top of each log with water, then roll the tops of the loaves in the oats. Place each loaf seam side down in an oiled 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Cover them with plastic wrap and allow to rise for about 2 hours, or until they have doubled in size (a finger pressed into the dough will leave an indentation).
Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone.
When the loaves have doubled, place the pans on the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves quickly 6 to 8 times then shut the oven door. Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later.

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tipped out of the pan and tapped on the bottom. The sides and bottom of the loaf should feel firm and slightly crusty. If the tops are browned but the sides are still somewhat soft, place the loaves directly on the stone to bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer the loaves from the pans to a rack and allow to cool completely before slicing.

Yield: 2 large loaves

DOUGH ROLLS
This recipe can be divided into 2 dozen pieces and shaped into rolls. Place in a square pan with rolls touching and sprinkle with oats. Let rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours and bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 15 to 20 minutes.

NOTES : A sponge starter bread
Mildly sweet and slightly crunchy, our version of whole wheat oatmeal bread is great for tuna sandwiches. Cut in thick slices, it's perfect for French toast. Shape it into rolls for a dinner party or a family picnic. For variety, add one and a half cups (seven and a half ounces) of golden raisins to the dough and shape half of it into twists; crusty and delicious, they're good for breakfast-on-the-go and afternoon snacks. This versatile bread is sure to become one of your favorites.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sourdough starter
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
     3/4           cup  water
                        ---
     1/3           cup  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oil
     1/2    tablespoon  honey
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
     1/4           cup  gluten, wheat
  1           teaspoon  salt
               handful  pumpkin seeds
                        -- or sunflower seeds
                        -- or poppy seeds
                        -- or flax seeds

First, you need a good starter. I bought a sample from a woman in Jerusalem who makes whole wheat sourdough for her restaurant. I have also used the Russian starter from Sourdoughs International with good results. I have never heard anything positive about the Gold Rush starter and would not waste my time on it. I'll assume you know how to handle a starter. I keep mine in a plastic Rubbermaid container.

I use exclusively organic stone ground whole wheat flour for feeding my starter and baking. The evening before baking, I take my starter out of the frig and feed it with a couple Tbsp flour. The following morning, take 1/2 cup of starter, 1 cup flour and 3/4 cup water, mix thoroughly in a glass bowl and leave at room temperature during the day. In the evening, add this mixture to your ABM. The order of addition of ingredients depends on the machine.

I add 1/3 cup water, about 1-1/2 Tbsp oil and about 1/2 Tbsp honey to the bowl of the ABM, and then add the starter. Then, add 1-1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup gluten (vital wheat gluten), 1 tsp salt, and a handful of pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, or poppy seeds (any others will do, as well). Bake on French bread cycle. This means a 5 hour cycle on the WS machine. You may have to add or subtract from the 1/3 cup water depending on your flour and the weather in your area. THe dough should be moist and just short of sticky. If in doubt, it's always best to start too moist and gradually add flour. Adding water to a dough that is too dry is a pain and rarely comes out good due to poor mixing.

Variations: 1 Tbsp spice (basil, oregano, etc.)

This bread is great with any kind of spread, especially good with shmeared avocado. I have NEVER had a problem with spoilage. I keep the bread out until I cut the first slice and thereafter I keep it in a food storage bag at room temperature. The bread lasts for a week with no problem.
