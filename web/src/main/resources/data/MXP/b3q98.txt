NOTES : I made this recipe last night and it was sooo light I couldn't believe that it came out of my machine! This is the first wheat bread that I have made that wasn't very heavy or like hockey pucks. I encourage everyone to try it.

Also this recipe gives you the weight of the flours equivalent to the measurements and that is how I made the bread. It makes a difference in the quality of the bread. If you don't weigh the flour you will probably have a heavier bread according to the book. Not all flours weigh the same. I didn't believe it until I tried it and a friend of mine didn't weigh her flour for the Light Rye Bread and it came out like a hockey puck and mine was moist and light and good.... ;~

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                  C  warm water
  2               Tbsp  barley malt syrup
  1               Tbsp  SAF instant yeast
  2                Tsp  salt
  5                  C  bread flour*
  3             Quarts  water
  2               Tbsp  barley malt syrup
                        Toppings
                        Cornmeal

1) Mix the syrup with the water in a large mixing bowl. Then fold together the flour, yeast, and salt in another bowl, reserving half a cup of flour or so for kneading. combine dry ingredients with water/syrup mixture.

2) After the dough has consolidated in the bowl, knead vigorously for 10-12 minutes. If you want your bagels to be really chewy, you have to work for it! Use reserved flour as necessary

3) Roll the dough into a log and cut into 12 equal sections. Shape each section into a ball, and make a hole in the center with your thumb about the size of a quarter. Let rise on floured surface about 25 minutes.

4) About 20 minutes into the rising, start the 3 quarts of water boiling. Add the syrup and mix well. Kettle the bagels four at a time for about four minutes. Turn the bagels gently with a wooden spoon every now and then.

5) While the bagels are kettling, prepare a baking sheet with cornmeal (or you
may use a baking stone if you have one for an even better crust). Use a slotted spatula or similar tool to transfer bagels to the baking sheet. Put on toppings as desired.

6) Bake in a 425F oven for about 20 minutes, or 450F for a darker crust.

NOTES : ( Note that all these bread-machine recipes can also be made the old-fashioned sweat-of-the-brow way, or the way I do, which is to do the messy mixing and kneading of the dough in my bread machine, and the shaping, final-rising, and baking in pans of my choice, in my oven.)

                       Better Bread Using Old Dough

Recipe By     :doggie@teleport.com (steve knight)
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  yeast

One way I have come across to improve my bread is to use old Dough. Now what I mean is I make a 6 cup batch of plain dough. yeast water and flour. I let it rise twice nice and slow. then put it in the refrigerator. So before I make bread I bring it out and let it warm up. The amount of the old dough in the new is not super critical. I use about 4 cups of it to 12 cups of flour. I then use far less yeast. about a teaspoon compared to a tablespoon.

This will change good bread into great bread. It is not sourdough so it does not really change the taste of bread. just makes it better. Makes the dough handle better too.

I take a small piece and make a batch of dough with 5 cups flour and about 2 tsp yeast. let it rise most of the day and then back into the fridge.

NOTES : I decided to try these muffins when the last portion of my raisin bran cereal was no longer in nice flakes. The muffins have a lighter bran taste than using bran buds & were very good. According to the book, you can keep the batter in the refrigerator for several weeks in a covered container & bake as needed. I didn't try this, however.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 1/2           cups  flour -- approximately
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast -- or one package
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        (or 4 tablespoons buttermilk powder
                        plus 1 cup water)
     1/3           cup  shortening
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Sesame or poppy seeds

In a larger mixer bowl stir together 2 cups flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and yeast.

In a microwave-proof bowl, combine water, buttermilk, and shortening. Microwave on high for 1 to 1.5 minutes, until the liquid is between 120- and 130F. Gradually add the liquid to the dry ingredients and beat for two minutes, using the flat beater. Add 1 cup flour to make a thick batter, and beat for another 2 minutes.

Remove the flat beater and replace with a dough hook. Add flour gradually, until the dough is soft, but not sticky. The dough will pull cleanly away from the sides of the bowl when it has enough flour. Knead the dough for about 8 minutes.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and put in a warm place (80 to 100F) until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Grease two medium (8.5- by 4.5-inches) loaf pans.

Punch down the dough and cut into two pieces. Turn the cut side under and gently press and pat the dough into an oblong shape that will fit tightly into the loaf pan. Cover with wax paper and return to a warm place for about 45 minutes, or until the dough has risen about 1 inch above the edge of the pan.

Preheat the oven to 375F about 20 minutes before baking. About 3 minutes before baking, brush the top of the loaves with egg, and sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden-brown. The loaf will sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. If it does not, you may return the bread to the oven without the pan for another 5 or 10 minutes. Place loaves on wire racks to cool. Makes two loaves.

Commercially available candied peel is quite suitable for this recipe. Sift the flour, baking soda, salt and sugar together; Add the unbeaten egg and the milk. Stir the liquids quickly and lightly into the dry ingredients, then add the nuts. Pour the batter into a loaf pan approximately 9 by 5 inches. Make sure it is well greased and dusted with flour. Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for about one hour. The bread is done when the crust is brown and no particles stick to a wire cake tester on a tooth-pick thrust into the centre of the loaf. Loosen the loaf from the pan with a knife, remove it from the pan and cool on a wire rack. The bread should not be sliced until it is thoroughly cool.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chapatti flour -- (ground wheat)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        hot water
                        Ghee for spreading
                        plain flour for rolling

Preparation time 10-15 minutes

Put the chapatti flour into a bowl, add the oil and mix lightly. Add enough hot water to make a soft dough. If the mixture is too sticky, add a teaspoon of ghee to the bowl and continue to knead.

Devide the dough into walnut sized pieces. Set your griddle on a medium setting. If you don't have a griddle then a heavy frying pan or a tavi will do. You will also need a wire rack set on an open flame or a very hot radiant ring.

Flatten a piece of dough between your palms and dip it in the plain flour. Now roll out to a thin round chapatti, aproximately 15 cms, 6 inches in diameter.

Cook for 1 minute on the griddle (or frying pan), turning once. Do not add any butter or oil to the frying pan as chapattis are cooked dry.

Turn onto a wire rack over a hot flame. the chapattis should, at this stage, bubble up into a round balloon. Turn quickly to avoid burning. When lightly browned on both sides, put the chapattis one at a time onto a warm plate and spread each one with ghee, placing them on top of each other as you make them. Do not worry if your chapattis do not bubble up completely. They will be quite acceptable if you cook them on both sides without broning them.

                        plain flour for dusting

Serves 6

Put the chapatti flour and salt into a large bowl, Add the oil and rub in with the fingertips. Add enough of the hot water to form a soft pliable dough. Devide the dough into tangerine sized balls. Roll each ball out on a floured surface to a 15 cms, 6 inch diameter disk.
Brush melted ghee over the round shape and dust with a little plain flour. Fold in half and repeat the last process twice more. You should end with a rough triangular shape. Do the same with the rest of the balls.
Now heat a tavi or non-stick frying pan over a low to medium heat. Carefully flatten each layered piece of dough on a floured board to about 5 mm, 1/4 inch thick. Try and keep a basic triangular shape as you roll. Cook each chapatti slowly on the tavi or frying pan, turning frequently, until it has bubbled up and is marked with golden spots all over. Brush a little ghee on the cooked chapattis and cool on a wire rack. Make all the chapattis in this way.

  1         tablespoon  Salt
                        Cornmeal to dust

Add yeast to sifted flour and slowly mix in the water. Beat for five minutes. Place in a bowl and brush with olive oil. Cover and leave to rise in a warm place until tripled in size (5-24 hours). Now chill.

Stir the warm water, milk and olive oil into the chilled mixture. Slowly add this mixture to the 1 1/4 lb of flour, adding the yeast and salt.

Using either a food processor or those at the end of your wrists, form into a dough and then knead on a floured surface until springy . Put dough in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size.

Divide into four and stretch dough into rectangles, pressing flat with your knuckles. Cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm place for 2 hours. Pre-heat oven to 450 F. Heat baking sheets in oven. Dust baking sheets with cornmeal and place dough on top.

Bake for 25 minutes, sprinkling with water three times during the first 10 minutes.

  4                  C  Bread Flour
  2 1/2            Tsp  Yeast
                        Filling:
     1/2             C  Butter -- Softened
  1                  C  Brown Sugar
  4                Tsp  Cinnamon
  1                  C  Brown Sugar
  4                Tsp  Cinnamon

                        Chopped, Roasted
                        Raisins -- To Taste

Rolls: Place ingredients in machine following the specifications of that particular machine. Set for dough cycle. After complete on dough cycle, remove from machine and roll out to 17x10" (approx.) rectangle.

Filling: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread softened butter over dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over top. Roll tightly from long end, pinching edges closed when completely rolled. Slice rolled dough into 1/2" slices (or large if a larger bun is preferred). Place into greased cake pans or a cookie sheet. If using cake pans, use 3 9" pans. Let rise until doubled. Bake at 350F for 15-20 minutes, until golden. Do not overbake.

Frosting: Spread on very warm rolls. They are best when eaten fresh, but we have found that 10-15 seconds in the microwave rejuvinates them.

            Country French Bread (Sourdough Bread And Starter)

                Starter                         Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sourdough Starter:
  1                cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
                        The Bread:
  2                  C  sourdough -- see above or buy
  3 1/2              C  warm water
  4                  C  whole wheat flour -- (4 to 4 1/2)
  2           packages  active dry yeast
     1/4             C  warm water
  4                Tsp  salt
  4                  C  unbleached flour -- (4 to 6)
                        coarse cornmeal

The sourdough starter:
Foods including wheat sour because of the action of microorganisms which are always present in the air. The basic principle of making a sourdough starter, then, is simply to let some flour "sour" or "spoil" over the course of a few days. Mix 1 C water with 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour. Put the mixture in a plastic, ceramic or glass (but not metal) bowl, and leave it open to the air for 2-3 days. If a crust forms, stir it in. Add more flour to make a soft dough, cover and let it sit a couple more days. By this time, the dough should have a distinct sour smell. To promote the souring, use water in which potatoes, pasta, rice or other grains have been cooked. Some bakers like to add a small amount of active dry yeast to the initial batter.

The Bread:

Put the sourdough starter into a bowl with the warm water. Add 2 C of the whole wheat flour and mix well. Add another 2 to 2 1/2 C of the whole wheat flour to form a thick batter, (or sponge) and beat it with a spoon to incorporate lots of air. Cover and let it set overnight, 8 to 10 hours in a moderately warm place such as a gas oven with the pilot light lit. You don't need the warmth, but the dough will take a lot longer to sour.

In the morning, remove 2 C of the sponge and use it to replenish your supply of starter. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, and stir it into the remaining batter, along with the salt. Fold in the white flour, 1/2 a C at a time, turning the bowl a quarter turn between folds to approximate the action of kneading. When the batter becomes too thick to continue in this way, turn it out onto a floured board and knead for 5 to 8 minutes, until the surface is smooth and satiny. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn it over to make sure that the top is covered in oil; Then set aside in a warm place to rise until it has more than doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

Sprinkle cornmeal on a baking sheet. Punch the dough down, shape it into 2 round loaves and place them on the baking sheet with several inches of space between them to give them room to rise. Brush or spray the tops with water, and let the loaves rise until they have more than doubled in size, about 40 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425F and place an empty pan on the bottom shelf, so that it will be hot when the bread is ready to bake. Make several cuts in the surface of the loaves, to allow the bread to expand without tearing. We often make a "tic-tac-toe" cross-hatching of cuts about 1/2 an inch deep and an inch apart across the whole surface. Place the bread in the oven, and pour a cup of hot water into the hot pan in the bottom of the oven being mindful that it will immediately begin to steam. Quickly close the oven door to keep the steam in. Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until a solid crust has formed, well browned on the bottom and lighter brown on the top. The loaves will sound hollow when thumped. The water in the pan should have steamed away, so the bread finishes baking in a dry oven. If the water has not gone in 25 minutes, remove the water pan from the oven. Take the finished loaves and turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.

The Stone and Peel

If using a pizza stone and peel, put the stone in the oven on the top shelf at the same time as the empty pan goes on the bottom shelf, and allow both to preheat for about 20 minutes. Dust the wooden peel generously with flour then scatter cornmeal over the flour. Set the loaves on the peel to rise, and when they are ready, slide them onto the heated stone. Add the hot water to the empty pan and close the oven door quickly to trap the steam. It may take a little less time to bake the bread on the stone than on a metal tray.
Makes 2 loaves, about 2 Lb each.

NOTES : This sturdy bread, which has a distinct, sour flavour, uses both a sourdough starter and yeast for leavening. The starter, can be made at home from the recipe given here, or bought commercially which is then mixed with fresh flour and water to form a thick batter which sets overnight. The fermentation which takes place at this time is what gives the bread its sour flavor and smell. In the morning, a portion of the batter is removed to provide starter for future use.
Both whole wheat and white flour are used so that the bread has an ample wheat flavor without being too heavy. You can vary the proportions of flour and a baking stone is excellent for this bread. You may have to bake one loaf at a time, or change the shape of the loaves to fit. Instructions for using the stone and peel (wooden paddle) are given at the end of the recipe.

  200            grams  plain flour -- (7oz)
  25             grams  cocoa powder -- r (1oz)
  1               tbsp  baking powder
     1/2           tsp  salt
  115            grams  caster sugar -- (4oz)

  225      milliliters  milk -- (8fl oz)
  1                tsp  vanilla essence

Makes 10-12 muffins

1 Preheat the oven to 200C/fan oven 190C/Gas 6. Line a 12 hole bun tin with double paper cases. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Stir in the sugar and chocolate chips, then make a well in the centre.


2 In another bowl beat the eggs with the oil until foamy.

Gradually beat in the milk and vanilla essence. Pour into the well and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.


3 Spoon the batter into the prepared cases, filling each about three-quarters full. Bake for about 20 minutes until risen, golden and springy when pressed with your fingertip.

Put the tin on a wire rack to cool for about 2 minutes, then remove muffins from the tin and put on to the wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Categories    : Bread Machine                   Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- large loaf
  9                oz.  Water -- (9 to 11)
                        -- (including any residual tomato-soaking
                        liquid)
  1 3/4      teaspoons  Salt
  2        tablespoons  Butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  Pre-chopped dried tomatoes -- soak
                        -- (of chopped pieces *before* soaking)
  4               cups  Bread flour
  2        tablespoons  Sugar
  2        tablespoons  Powdered nonfat milk
  1         tablespoon  Parisiennes Bonnes Herbes -- *
  2 1/4      teaspoons  Active dry yeast

*Note ==> the PBH is from Penzey's and is a blend of (dried): chives, dill weed, French basil, French tarragon, chervil and white pepper (as listed on the label). I'd think any blend of dried herbs you especially like would also work just fine.

Place ingredients in machine in appropriate order (liquid is given as a range to allow for differences in machines and humidity/temperature, etc. -- I start with 10 oz. when using this recipe, and adjust as needed.); use Large/Light cycle (3 hrs., 10 min. total time on my machine) setting. Be prepared for the rather unusual color of this bread -- the tomatoes 'run' and it usually comes out a pinky-orange! We're especially fond of using this bread for grilled-cheese sandwiches.

                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : I often make this bread, which is a (slight) adaptation of the 'Classic White' bread recipe in the booklet that came with my Regal Kitchen Pro machine. I snip into small pieces and pre-soak the dried tomatoes (in water), using any leftover liquid as part of the water in the recipe. Please bear in mind that Regal machines tend to use *less* liquid than others, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid to suit your own machine. (The loaf size is listed as 'large' in the recipe book, and I'm guessing that it's what other recipes refer to as a 2# loaf, based on the amount of flour used. If you want a smaller loaf, you can probably use a white or wheat recipe that works for you, adding the tomatoes and herbs and making any minor adjustments needed. There are just two of us in our household, and this bread *never* has a chance to go stale!)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2              C  All-Purpose Flour -- To 4 C
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  1                  C  Milk
     1/4             C  Sugar
     1/4             C  Butter Or Margarine

                        Slightly Beaten
  1               Tbsp  Water

In a large mixing bowl combine 1-1/2 cups of the flour and the yeast; set aside. In a medium saucepan heat and stir the milk, sugar, margarine or butter, and salt just till warm (120 to 130F) and margarine almost melts. Add to the flour mixture. Then add the 3 egg yolks.

Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can.

On a lightly floured surface, knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Place in a greased bowl; turn once. Cover; let rise in a warm place till double (about 1 hour).

Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half. Then divide each half into 12 pieces. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, grease baking sheets. To shape rolls, roll each piece into a 12- inch rope. Tie in a loose knot. Tuck top end under the roll. Then bring bottom end up and tuck it into center of roll. Place 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly double (about 30 minutes).

Brush rolls with a mixture of one egg yolk and water. Bake in a 375F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or till golden. Remove rolls from baking sheets and cool on a wire rack.

Makes 24

NOTES : This is my favorite recipe and I use it all the time, the bread has small air pockets in it that hold the butter well and it makes wonderful toast.  It is called English Muffin Bread but it really does not taste like english muffins.

NOTES : This one is different in that it calls for the legumes to be cooked first. Also, since this is an ABM recipe, I suspect this creates more of a traditional yeast bread dough, while the other two I posted are basically batter breads.

  2 1/2           cups  hard red wheat
  1 1/2           cups  spelt or rye
     1/2           cup  hulled barley
     1/2           cup  millet
     1/4           cup  green lentils
  2        tablespoons  great northern beans
  2        tablespoons  red kidney beans
  2        tablespoons  pinto beans
                        ---
  4               cups  lukewarm water
  1                cup  honey

  2        tablespoons  Red Star Yeast
                        ---
  2          teaspoons  salt

Stir the first ingredients very well. Grind in flour mill.

Then measure the next ingredients into large bowl. Set aside for 3-5 minutes to allow yeast to grow.

Then add the salt and the fresh milled flour to yeast mixture.

Stir until well kneaded about 10 minutes. This is a batter type bread and will not form a smooth ball.

Pour dough into greased pans. You may use 2 large loaf pans or 3 med. loaf pans or 2-9x13 pans. Let rise in a warm place for one hour or until the dough is almost to the top of the pan. If it rises too much it will over flow the pan while baking. Bake at 350 for 45-50 minutes for loaf pans and 35-40 minutes for 9x13 pans.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat
  1 1/2           cups  whole rye
     1/2           cup  barley
     1/4           cup  millet
     1/4           cup  lentils
  2               Tbsp  great northern beans -- (uncooked)
  2               Tbsp  red kidney beans -- (uncooked)
  2               Tbsp  pinto beans -- (uncooked)
  2               cups  lukewarm water -- divided
                        ---
     1/2           cup  honey -- PLUS
  1           teaspoon  honey -- divided
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  salt

Measure and combine all the above ingredients in a large bowl. Put this mixture into a flour mill and grind. The flour should be the consistency of regular flour. Coarse flour may cause digestion problems. This makes eight cups of flour. Use four cups per batch of bread.

Measure four cups of flour into a large bowl. Store the remaining flour mixture in the freezer for future use.

Measure one cup lukewarm water (110-115 degrees) in a small mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of the honey and the yeast, stir to dissolve the yeast, cover and set aside, allowing the yeast to rise for five to ten minutes.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the following: olive oil, 1/2 cup honey and remaining cup of warm water. Mix well and add this to the flour mixture in the large bowl. Add the yeast to the bowl and stir until well mixed. The mixture should be the consistency of slightly "heavy" cornbread. Spread the mixture evenly in a 11by15 inch pan sprayed with no-cholesterol cooking oil. Let the mixture rise for one hour in a warm place.

Bake at 375 degrees for approximately thirty minutes. Check for doneness. Bread should be the consistency of baked cornbread.

This recipe has been adapted directly from Ezekiel 4:9

(There is some confusion about the "fitches" called for in the original recipe. Apparently, the fitches referred to an herb. Cumin, fennel and nutmeg have all been suggested as the mis-translated "fitches." Take your pick or leave them out. Any of them will add a unique taste to your homemade bread.)

I found this recipe in a little book I found at the checkstand of my local supermarket. It does not require you to grind your own grain and beans. It is a huge recipe, though. One would need a larger machine than even my KA. A Magic Mill might be able to handle it. Or we could make it by hand! What a concept! I have not yet made this bread.

                              Flour Tutorial

Recipe By     :Cookwise, Shirley O. Corriher
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

You need High Gluten = High-Protein Flour for
(Strength, Elasticity, Yeast Doughs)

Yeast breads
Strudel
Cream puffs, popovers, Yorkshire pudding
Puff pastry
Pasta (durum wheat)


You Need Low Gluten = Low-Protein Flour for
(Tenderness, baking Powder- and Baking soda-Leavened Batters)

Quick breads (baking powder or soda)
Cakes, muffins, pancakes
Pie crusts
Dumplings, Asian soft noodles


When gluten-or no gluten-really matters.

The right flour for the job can literally mean the success or failure of a dish. Take John Clancy's strudel, fur instance. John Clancy was the test kitchen chef for the Time-Life series Foods of the World, a series so outstanding that cooks and chefs rely on it because "the recipes always work."

When John taught in Atlanta several years ago, he prepared the magnificent strudel from Joseph Weschberg's The Cooking of Vienna's Empire. For strength and elasticity in a thinly stretched strudel, a high-protein flour makes the needed gluten. I assisted him and bought his groceries. For the strudel, I bought bread flour for strength and elasticity.

John was so thrilled, he hugged me. "Shirley, I did this strudel yesterday in Texas, and the only flour they had was Southern low-protein flour-not much gluten. My poor strudel looked like Swiss cheese!" Using the bread flour, John made a six-foot-long strudel so thin you could read the Washington Post through
it.

The right flour makes an incredible difference in the quality of a loaf of bread. A loaf made with a high-protein flour (like bread flour) will rise well in both risings and then bake into a light, airy loaf with good brown crust color. A loaf made with a low-protein flour (like Southern all-purpose or cake flour) will not rise well and will bake into a heavy, dense textured, pale loaf.

Different kinds of flour can solve many baking problems. A chef from a test kitchen, for example, told me the had a wonderful lemon square recipe, but she could not use it because the lemon squares were so tender that they fell apart. No problem-a little gluten will hold them together. She could change the flour from bleached all-purpose to unbleached all-purpose, which is a higher-protein flour and will form more gluten. Or she could cut the sugar, which interferes with gluten formation. Either way, the lemon squares will be perfect.

Gluten and water absorption

For thousands of years, cooks have known that some flours absorb more water than others, but they usually blamed it on humidity. Humidity really has very little influence. The gluten proteins join with each other and water to form gluten. It's primarily protein content that determines how much water a flour will absorb.

This difference in water absorption can be major. For example, 2 cups of high-protein bread flour absorb 1 cup of water to form a soft, sticky dough. However, 2 cups of low-protein Southern flour or cake flour and 1 cup of water make a thick soup. It takes 1/2 cup more low-protein flour to get the same consistency dough as with the high-protein flour. This means that even a small recipe with 2 cups of flour can be off by 1/2 cup if the wrong flour is used! This is a difference of 25 percent; commercial recipes with 20 pounds of flour could be off by 5 pounds. Regardless of measure by weight or volume, the type of flour will make a big difference.

Cooks are constantly faced with this problem. The person writing the recipe uses one kind of flour, and the person following the recipe uses another. When driving through Georgia, Mrs. Jones of Connecticut purchases a local church cookbook. When she gets home, she makes Miss Lolly's Cake. The recipe says 2 cups all-purpose flour. Miss Lolly always uses White Lily all-purpose, a low-protein, partially chlorinated flour, and her cakes are superb. Mrs. Jones uses her favorite local all-purpose, high- protein Hecker's, which makes great yeast bread but soaks in the cake liquids and makes a stiff batter and a dry cake. Mrs. Jones thinks this is the worst recipe she has ever followed.

As you might suspect, even worse problems can result when trying to translate foreign recipes containing flour. If there can be over 1/2 cup difference in a 2 cup recipe around the United States, just think about the possible difference in trying to follow a recipe written in another country!

Some time ago, when I was teaching at a chefs' training center in Vancouver, British Columbia, the young chefs were excited about Paul Prudhomme's Cajun cookbook. They loved his recipes, but they were having a real problem with his sweet potato pecan pie. The filling was delicious, but the crust was a disaster. What had they done wrong?

Chef Paul's recipe called for l cup all-purpose flour, and he was probably using a low-protein Southern flour. In Canada the flour called all-purpose is actually a very-high-protein flour. (Canada produces some of the highest-protein flours in the world. Carol Field, in her book The Italian Baker, mentions that a baker who wants to make very light bread will add Manitoba - a Canadian high-protein flour.) So when the young Canadian chefs tried to use it in Paul's recipe, the amount of liquid in the recipe did not even dampen the flour, let alone form a dough. When they added enough liquid to form a dough, the dough was so tough that they could hardly roll it out. "Oh, no!" I said. "What Paul meant was a flour like your cake and pastry flour." This second major type of Canadian flour is low in protein and just right for cakes and pie crusts. So flour labeled "all-purpose" may not suit your purpose at all. All-purpose flour from one place can be totally different from all-purpose flour somewhere else. In fact, the traditional cuisines of the Northern and Southern United States reflect this difference. The South is noted for its pies, biscuits, and cakes, which the low-protein flour from Southern wheat produces beautifully. Cookbooks from New England and the Midwest that date from before the extensive distribution of national brands of flour contain many fine yeast bread recipes, best made with high-protein flour.

Furthermore, flours labeled as all-purpose can differ from each other in the same geographical region. National brands can differ from regional brands in protein content, and unbleached all-purpose is usually different from bleached all-purpose. Two all-purpose flours that you can buy in most markets in the South - Pillsbury unbleached all-purpose, with 12+ grains of protein per cup, and White Lily all-purpose, with about 8.6 grams of protein per cup, vary by almost 1/2 cup of flour per 2 cup recipe in the amount needed to absorb 1 cup of liquid.

There are no easy solutions. Many recipes using flour are written with an approximate amount, such as "2 to 3 cups flour" or "6 to 8 cups flour." The amount of flour in a recipe is actually a ballpark figure.

The way flour absorbs water tells you a lot about the flour. A flour that absorbs a lot of water is high in protein and good for yeast doughs. They tell of old Cerman bakers who could shove a sweaty arm into the flour barrel and tell what kind of flour it was by how much clung to the arm!

You don't have to master this particular art, but you can perform a similar test by combining an unknown flour and water in the food processor. From the consistency of the dough, you can make a good guess at the protein content by using the following procedure.

Measure 2 cups and 1 tablespoon of bread flour and place it in the workbowl of a food processor with the steel knife. If you measure by scooping a dry measuring cup into the flour bag, filling it, and slightly packing the flour as you level it off against the inside of the bag, a little over 2 cups of bread flour will absorb 1 cup of water, producing a sticky dough ball when processed for about 30 seconds. Perform the same test with cake flour and you will find that it takes over 2 1/2 cups to form a similar sticky dough hall. This gives you a standard. You know that if a little over 2 cups of flour plus 1 cup of water make a sticky dough ball, the flour has about 14 grams of protein per cup. If the dough barely forms a ball and is wet, needing from 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour to reach the same consistency, it is an all-purpose flour with about 12 grams of protein per cup. If the dough is so wet that it does not form a ball at all and requires over 1/2 cup more flour to reach the same consistency, you have the equivalent of a Southern low-protein flour or cake flour with 8 to 9 grams of protein per cup, great for pie crusts.

Place ingredients in bread pan, select Dough setting, and press Start.

When dough has risen long enough the machine will beep. Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan and turn out dough on a floured countertop or cutting board.

Oil a 10 x 15 x 1 inch jelly-roll pan. With your hands, gently stretch and press dough to fit evenly into pan. Cover and let rise in warm oven 30-40 minutes until doubled. Remove pan from oven to preheat oven to 400 degrees.

With 2 fingers, poke holes all over the dough. In a medium bowl, combine the oil and garlic; drizzle over top of dough. Sprinkle with cheese and parsley. Bake 25-30 minutes until brown. Remove from oven. Cool on wire rack or cut into squares and serve warm. Wrapped in plastic it will keep fresh at room temperature for 2 to 3 days.

NOTE: I like to use a little basil in the dough, and also mixed with the
olive oil on top instead of the parsley.

  2                tsp  coarse sea salt
                        extra flour for dusting
                        extra oil for greasing bowl

* to use easy-blend dried yeast:-
Add one 7g sachet with the chopped rosemary
Put all liquid in the bowl at once and proceed with the recipe

a roasting or baking tin, about 25cm x 35cm

-    makes 1 loaf

1/   Cream yeast to a smooth liquid with half the water.
2/   Add 3 tbsp oil and the remaining water.
3/   Add salt, chopped rosemary and half the flour.
4/   Beat into the liquid with your hand.
5/   When combined, work in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft but not sticky dough.
6/   Knead for 10 mins until smooth and silky (or 5 mins slowly in a mixer with a dough hook).
7/   Leave to rise (doubled in size) at cool to normal temperature in a lightly oiled mixing bowl, covered with a damp tea towel - about 2 hours.
8/   Knock back and shape into a rectangle, then press into the base of the tin. Push into the corners and even out.
9/   Cover and let rise until about doubled (about 45mins).
10/ Flour fingertips and make 1 cm dimples in the dough at regular intervals.
11/ Cover and let double again - about an hour (I find it takes less time). **
12/ Press sprigs of rosemary into the dimples and fill with olive oil.
13/ Sprinkle with sea salt.
14/ **Bake in a pre-heated oven at 220C (425F) Gas 7 for 20-25mins or until golden brown then cool an a wire rack.

I love this with strong cheese!

                        French Bread, Blue Ribbon

Recipe By     :Bernard Clayton's New Complete Book of Breads
Serving Size  : 32    Preparation Time :3:45
Categories    : Breads                          Daily Bread Mailing List
                Hand Made                       International Breads
                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- up to 5 cups
  2               cups  hot water (120- to 130F)
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt

In a large mixing or mixer bowl, stir together yeast, dry milk, sugar, salt, and 2 cups flour. Pour in the hot water and add the butter. Blend for 2 minutes with the flat beater of the mixer. Stir in the balance of the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, switching to the dough hook after about 1 additional cup of flour has been added. The dough will be a shaggy mass, elastic, but not sticky; it will clean the sides of the bowl. If it continues to be moist, sprinkle on additional flour.

Place a kitchen towel over the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.

Turn the mixer to Speed 2 and knead for 10 minutes.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap to retain moisture, and leave at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 1-1/4 hours.

Punch down the dough and turn it onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 30 seconds to press out the bubbles, cut into two pieces, and form each into a ball.

For a round loaf, place the dough on a corner of a greased or Teflon baking sheet or in a small basket, lined loosely with a cloth and sprinkled with flour.

For a long loaf, roll the ball into a rectangle, about 10" x 16". Roll the dough until your palms into a long loaf which can be placed directly on a greased or Teflon baking sheet or in a long cloth-lined basket. Later, after it has risen, it will be turned from the basket directly onto the baking sheet.

Cover the loaves carefully with waxed paper and place in a warm place. Leave until doubled in volume, about 45 to 50 minutes (I've found its usually longer).

Prepare the oven by placing a large, shallow roasting pan under the bottom shelf of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400-degrees F. about 20 minutes before baking. Three minutes before placing the loaves in the oven, pour 1 pint hot water in the pan. Be careful of the steam that will suddenly erupt.

If the loaves have raised in baskets, simply tip the raised loaf into your hand and quickly turn the loaf right side up and onto the baking sheet. Brush with cold water and sprinkle with the coarse salt (or sesame seeds or poppy seeds).

With a razor blade or a sharp knife, slash the round loaves with a tic-tac-toe design, the long loaves with diagonal cuts.

Bake the loaves until they are golden brown, 45 minutes. Turn over one loaf and tap the bottom crust; a hard hollow sound means the bread is baked. If not, return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Midway during baking
and again near the end of it, shift the loaves on the baking sheets so they are exposed equally to the temperature variations of the oven.

Remove the loaves from the oven and place them on wire racks to cool.

  1 1/2       Packages  Active dry yeast
  2        Tablespoons  Sugar
  1 1/2           Cups  Warm Water
  3 1/2           Cups  All-Purpose Flour -- More As Needed
  2          Teaspoons  Salt

Soften yeast with 1 tsp. sugar in 1/2 cup very warm water. ("Very warm"
warm feels comfortably warm when run over wrist.) Let yeast-water mixture
stand 54 minutes, or until doubled in bulk and foamy. In food processor,
with motor running, add flour, salt, remaining 1 tsp. sugar and yeast
mixture.

Blend and slowly add very warm water up to 1 cup, or until dough forms a
smooth ball.  Turn out dough on lightly floured board or countertop. Knead
only a couple of turns; divide in two and shape into loaves.

Place in greased baguette pans. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in warm
place away from drafts 45 minutes, or until bulk doubles.

Bake in preheated 450F oven for 15 minutes, with shallow pan of water in
bottom of the oven.  Bread is done when hitting it with a knife give a
hallow ring.

Note:  Jill Cautions, "Most of the kneading is done in the food processor;
therefore, knead only a couple of turns as directed."

  1                     Cake of yeast -- or package
     1/4             C  lukewarm water
     3/4             C  milk

  4 1/2              C  sifted flour

Soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. Scald the milk and add the softened butter, sugar and salt. Cool to lukewarm and then stir in the eggs, yeast and flour. Knead until a smooth dough is formed. Place in a greased bowl and cover. Let the dough rise until it has doubled in bulk.

Divide the dough in thirds and roll out each piece into a 10 inch crescent. Cut each circle into 12 wedge-shaped pieces. Roll up each wedge, starting at the large and and rolling towards the point, which should end up on top. Place these rolled up wedges, which you slightly curve in at the ends, on a greased baking sheet. They should be placed several inches apart in their crescent shapes. Let them rise again until doubled in bulk, then brush with melted butter.

Bake in a preheated oven at 400F for about 15 minutes or until brown.

This should make 36 croissants.

NOTES : Although these croissants can be bought in many frozen sections in most food markets now, everyone loves the flaky, tender real French croissant. The classic method takes much time and patience. Here is a simplified version of the famous original recipe.

I love these and have made them several times.

                            Gnocchi, Homemade

Categories    : Bread Machine                   Daily Bread Mailing List
                Miscellaneous & Tips            Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3               cups  ricotta cheese
  1                     egg -- beaten
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  additional flour -- as needed
  3               cups  tomato sauce

Place water, olive oil & ricotta cheese in bread machine. Add beaten egg, flour & set machine to dough cycle. Start machine. (Tomaselli uses The Breadman machine, which, he said, takes 23 minutes to go through 3 kneading cycles.)

Be aware that humidity plays a factor in the kneading of gnocchi. Warm & humid weather tends to soften the dough and make it sticky to the touch. If this occurs, slowly introduce the additional flour as needed until the dough no longer feels sticky.

Remove dough from machine (it will come out as a ball of perhaps 8 inches in diameter). It will flatten to a disc-like shape by itself, resting on the work surface. Lightly flour & place in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Remove dough from refrigerator & place on floured working surface. Starting at one side of the disc, cut off 1/2 inch wide slices, one at a time. Roll the slice between your hands into the form of a rope, about 3/4 inch in diameter. Cut the rope into 1 inch pieces. Lightly roll each piece over the back of the prongs of a fork to create ridges in the surface of the gnocchi. (This helps the sauce to adhere to the gnocchi.)

Repeat this process until you have enough pieces to make 1 layer in a 9 x 13 inch floured baking pan. Sprinkle the layer with some flour & cover with a piece of wax paper. Continue with the rest of the dough, forming layers & sprinkling each layer with flour, then covering with wax paper until all the dough has been used. Cover the top layer with wax paper & refrigerate dough for 2 hours.

Bring a large pot (such as a 12 qt. stockpot) of water to a rolling boil, add salt to taste. Add gnocchi to boiling water. Gnocchi will rise to top. Wait until they have at least doubled in size, then cook an additional 6 to 10 minutes. Taste for desired doneness. If you take them out too early, they will be soft.

Using a slotted spoon, remove gnocchi. Place in a large bowl & serve with tomato sauce. Serves 4 to 6

Grinding: 3 cups (1 pound) of berries will yield about 4 cups ground flour.

Sprout: Rinse berries well with purified water.   Drain and place in jar
 that will allow for expansion 4x.  Leave top ajar and place in dark place.
 Twice a day rinse with purified water and drain.  Keep in dark.  In 3-5
 days there will be white root that is length of berry and berries will
 smell fresh and sweet.  They are now ready for baking.

Cook berries: Soak overnight 1 cup berries in 4 cups water.  Next day drain
 and place in saucepan.  Add 4 cups cold water.  Bring to a boil and cover.
 Simmer about 50 minutes or until berries are just tender.  Add more water
 as necessary.  Drain.  1 cup dry berries yields 3 cups cooked berries.

NOTES : This version, flavored with old-fashioned rolled oats and dark
molasses, is similar to the soda bread served at Ballymaloe House in County
Cork, Ireland.  Bake the bread early in the day and reheat it just before the
guests arrive. [Cox]

The directions say to knead a couple of times after mixing all the ingredients, but this was more like a brownie batter than a bread dough! I tried to knead it, but it was a ridiculous effort, even after adding almost another 1/2 cup of flour. I ended up using a wooden spoon to scrape the batter up and mound it onto a baking sheet.

The bread didn't rise much and it's basically a flat disc, about 1 - 1 1/2 inches high. I also could have let it bake a little longer as it is slightly goey in the middle. But the taste is wonderful! [Ellen]

Serving Ideas : Toast lightly & make ham salad sandwiches.

NOTES : I had some time yesterday to do some experimenting with my bread machine. I had some leftover ham I wanted to make ham salad out of but couldn't find a recipe for bread that I wanted to go with it, so I found 5 different recipes & started doing some experiments with the recipes. I kind of combined some of the ingredients from a couple recipes to make a single recipe. I had 4 really nice boat anchors & 1 really nice loaf that was excellent lightly toasted & used with the ham salad to make sandwiches. As I'm sure you don't want the boat anchor recipes I'll just post my successful recipe.

                             Olive Oil Bread

Recipe By     :The greens Cook Book, Deborah Madison
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads                          Daily Bread Mailing List
                Hand Made                       Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                  C  warm water
  1                Tsp  salt
  3               Tbsp  virgin olive oil
  1              pinch  sugar
  2 1/2              C  white flour -- or mixed whole
                        wheat and white
                        coarse sea salt

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the salt, olive oil, and sugar. Stir in the flour in 2 or 3 additions. Once a dough has formed, turn it out onto a board dusted with flour and knead it for several minutes, adding only enough flour to prevent the dough from sticking. When the dough is smooth and shiny, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it upside down to make sure the top is oiled. Put it in a warm place to rise, until it is doubled in size, about 30-40 minutes.
Turn the dough out onto the counter and form into shapes with a rolling pin either 1 large or 2 small loaves, about 1/2 an inch thick. Make several cuts in the top of the dough, in the center of the oval. Parallel or fan-shaped cuts, or many little diagonal slices. Then, pull the edges of the dough apart, opening the cuts to give the loaf a latticed appearance. If you are going to bake the bread on a pizza stone, transfer the loaf to a well floured peel. Otherwise, put it on a well oiled baking sheet. Brush the bread with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and set it aside to rise for 20 minutes.
Heat the oven to 450F and if using a pizza stone, warm it for 20 minutes.

After it has risen, slide it onto the pizza stone, or put the baking sheet in the oven. Bake in the top third of the oven, for 20-30 minutes, or until the bread is nicely browned. You can spray the bread and oven with a fine mist of water 2 or 3 times during the first 10 minutes of cooking to help give the bread a good crust. Serve hot from the oven, with or without butter.

Variations

Olive oil bread with green olives: Use about 2 dozen green nicoise olives.
After the dough has been rolled out into an oval, place it on a baking sheet or floured pizza peel. Use your fingertips to make firm indentations in the surface of the dough and place an olive in each indentation. Brush with olive oil and let it rise for 20 minutes, then bake according to the recipe. Instead of the olives, press chopped onion or rosemary or sage leaves into the surface before letting it rise.

NOTES : The author says,
We always make this bread for weekend dinners, varying it with additions of rosemary or sage leaves, olives, onions, and coarse sea salt. a flattish bread with toppings, it is almost like a very simple pizza. The dough tender and fragrant with olive oil is a pleasure to make. It is easy to handle and requires only one rise, making it fairly quick to prepare for lunch or dinner.
Olive oil bread can be shaped in a variety of different ways, usually we roll the dough into an oval, make a number of decorative cuts, then pull the edges of the dough to open the cuts to reveal a pattern. The dough can also be left uncut, covered with onions or studded with green olives. If you have a pizza stone, bake the bread right on it for a lovely toasty crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 lb loaf
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  3                  C  bread flour
  3         tablespoon  dehydrated onion flakes
  2         tablespoon  granulated garlic
                        -- (I used Trader Joe's granulated roasted
                        garlic)
  1                tsp  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4         tablespoon  nonfat dry milk
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                  C  water
  1              large  egg
  1                tsp  lemon juice

I did this on the manual setting and then let it do its final rise in a standard loaf pan and baked it at 325 for 25 or 30 or so minutes (until it was done...I didn't pay a lot of attention to the exact amount of time) with a pan of hot water on the lowest shelf of the oven. Apparently this did the trick, as we ended up with only one end slice for breakfast the next morning.

NOTES : I sort of invented as the result of not having all the ingredients to make Onion Egg Bread from Tom Lacalamita's ULTIMATE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK.

Even my husband, who doesn't normally like bread for its own sake, liked this one.

NOTES : I had made the orange scone recipe I posted last week, and used apricot instead of oranges (stronger taste-very good), but I apparently miscounted the cups of flour, and
probably left out a whole cup! The result took much longer to bake (obviously), but was outstanding!-it was kind of like a custardy egg thing, that I would not hesitate to serve at a brunch. I would keep it refrigerated if you try this.

FYI-I made the orange scones a second time, with the correct amount of flour, and used 1 tb butter and the rest lite cream cheese for the 1/3 cp butter, and they came out great-my hubby is already on his second piece this morning! [Nicki]

                        -- 1 1/2 lb. (medium)
  1 1/2           Cups  Water
  2        Tablespoons  Butter
     1/2           Cup  Honey
  2               Cups  Bread Flour
  2 3/4           Cups  Whole Wheat Flour
  1         Tablespoon  Cocoa
  1         Tablespoon  Sugar.
  2               Tsp.  Instant Coffee
  1               Tsp.  Salt
  1                     pkg.Yeast

  45             Drops  Blue Food Coloring
  30             Drops  Yellow Food Coloring

How does the bread get so dark? While you may notice the recipe includes instant coffee and cocoa, these ingredients will not give it it's deep dark chocolate brown color - not even close. Usually breads that are this dark -- such as pumpernickel or dark bran muffins -- contain caramel color, an ingredient often used in the industry to darken foods. Since your local supermarket will not likely have this mostly commercial product, we will make the caramel color from a mixture of three food colorings -- red, yellow and blue. Just be sure to get the food coloring in the little droppers so that you can count the drops as you measure. That's very important to getting the color just right. You may also opt to keep the color out. The bread will certainly taste the same, but will look nothing like the real deal. I suggest using a bread machine for the mixing and kneading, if you have one.

Add ingredients to machine according to manufacturer's directions.

Once the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the food coloring with 1/4 cup water and drizzle it into the mixture as it combines.

After the dough is done, let it rest to rise for about an hour. Remove it from the pan when the dough has doubled. Punch dough down and divide it into 8 even portions. Form the portions into tubular loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide.
Sprinkle the loves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie sheet. Cover and let rise for another hour.
Preheat the oven to 350F and bake loaves for 20-24 minutes. Loaves should begin to lightly darken on top when done.

  4                     unsifted all-purpose flour -- (4 to 4 1/2)

Dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl. Stir in the cream and the 2 C of flour, and beat until smooth. Cover, and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, (about 1/2 to 1 hour).

Stir in the egg yolks, sugar, butter, salt, cardamon, lemon and orange peels, raisins and almonds; Beat until thoroughly combined. Stir in 1 C of the milk and the rye flour until combined, then add all but 1/2 C of the remaining flour. Stir well to make a thick dough. Sprinkle the last 1/2 C of flour onto a board and turn the dough out onto the board. knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Butter the bowl and place the dough inside it, turning the dough over to grease the top. Cover lightly and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled in size.

Punch the dough down and work into a smooth ball. Place the dough, rounded side up, in 2 well greased, straight-sided pails, and let rise until doubled in size.

Bake in a moderate oven, 350F for 1 hour.

Before removing from the oven, test with a long straw or wooden skewer to make sure it is done all the way through. If the bread is well browned and sounds hollow when tapped with the fingers, brush the top of the loaves with butter and leave to cool in the pails for about 20 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. Cool completely. Cut the loaf into quarters and slice into about 40 triangular slices from both loaves. It is delicious served with cheeses such as Camembert, brie, or natural cream cheese. Hard cheeses such as Edam, Swiss or gouda are also excellent when served with summer soup.

NOTES : This aromatic sweet bread of Finland is traditionally baked in a small milk pail to symbolize abundance. The finished loaf resembles a giant mushroom. It's name comes from the Finnish word ""to get free" which is also the root of the word for Easter. You can bake it in two pails, such as children's sand buckets, (about 1 1/2 quarts in size) or in 2 Lb coffee cans. but do not use a galvanized pail.

  1           Teaspoon  sugar
                        No-sugar-added peach spread (optional)

1. Combine first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl; cut in margarine with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add yogurt and peaches to flour mixture; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened.

2. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour evenly over work surface. Turn dough out onto floured surface, and knead lightly 4 or 5 times. (Dough may be slightly sticky.)

3. Pat dough into a 5-inch circle on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Cut circle into 4 wedges; separate wedges slightly. Brush milk over dough, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake at 400 for 14 to 15 minutes or until golden. Serve with peach spread, if desired.

     1/4      Teaspoon  Garlic salt -- or powder
     1/4    Tablespoon  parsley, freeze-dried
     1/4      Teaspoon  Italian seasonings
  1              Pound  Bisquick. baking mix
  8 3/4         Ounces  Cold water
     1/4         Pound  sharp Cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/8           Cup  Butter or margarine

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix Bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes. After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.) Serve hot.

The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll have to
reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2 cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12 biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if desired.

                              Pizza Dough #7

Recipe By     :krisy@womansjournal.com (Kris Young)
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Pizza And Calzones


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
                        water

My pizza dough ingredients are really simple; I just use 2 1/2 cups flour (all purpose or bread flour, both give good but slightly different results), 1 teaspoon (or so) of each: active dry yeast, salt, sugar, and olive oil (plus a little more to oil the bowl), and enough water to make a nice dough in my Cuisinart. I actually only measure the flour and the yeast.

I like to use 2 1/2 cups of flour for each 14 inch pizza crust. In addition, a longer rise makes a much nicer crust than a short rise. My best crusts come from dough made a day or two in advance and refrigerated after the first rise. I just put it in a plastic bag and punch down if it rises too much in the refrigerator. Just take the dough out so that there is enough time for it to come to room temperature before you start making your pizza. Another hint is to prick the dough with a fork after rolling (or pulling) out so big bubbles will not form on your pizza wile cooking.


My pizza stone broke in half after using it several times and turned ugly and black. I just push the two pieces together at the broken edge and it still works great. Two pieces are actually easier for me to handle than the original one piece.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               Tbsp  oil
  2                  C  chapatti flour -- (ground wheat)
  1               Tbsp  dahi -- (natural yoghurt)
  4                 Oz  plain flour for dipping -- dusting and rolling
                        warm water
                        slightly salted butter -- softened

Mix the oil into the flour. Make a hole in the middle and add the dahi and enough warm water to form a soft pliable dough. Divide the dough into small tangerine sized pieces, flatten each piece between the palms of your hands and dip each one in flour. Roll out one at a time into circles. Spread lightly with softened butter and sprinkle with plain flour. Fold in half and repeat the process. Fold into a quarter and spread with butter again. Sprinkle plain flour on the quartered pieces sprinkle with flour again, gather up the 3 corners and roll gently between your palms to form a ball.

Roll out on a floured board to form a thick round shape---approximately 12 cms, 5 inches in diameter. Cook slowly on the griddle or heavy frying pan over a medium heat. Turn the parathas over until both sides are lightly brown.

  1                  C  warm whole milk
  1                  C  warm water
  1 1/2       packages  active dry yeast -- (3 1/2 Tsp)
  2               Tbsp  honey -- or sugar
  6                  C  unbleached white flour -- or 7
     1/2            Lb  small red potatoes
  3               Tbsp  corn oil -- or saffron oil
  1               Tbsp  salt
  1                     egg -- plus
  1               Tbsp  milk -- for egg wash
                        -- or water beaten

Combine the milk and water in a large bowl, stir in the yeast, and let it dissolve; Then, add the honey or sugar and 3 Cups of the flour. Beat vigorously with a spoon to form a thick, smooth batter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Wilst the dough is rising, boil or steam the potatoes, leaving the skins on if you like. Mash the cooked potatoes with a fork, and set them aside to cool. Once the dough has risen, add the potatoes, oil and salt and mix well.

Fold in about 2 more cups of flour, 1/2 a cup at a time, turning the bowl a quarter turn between folds, to approximate the action of kneading. When the dough becomes to thick to handle in this way, turn it out onto a floured surface and begin kneading. Knead the dough until the surface is smooth and satiny, 5 to 8 minutes, adding only enough flour to prevent sticking.

Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn it over so the top is also coated, then cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Punch it down and let it rise again, 35-40 minutes.

Shape the dough into two loaves place them in oiled pans, and let them rise until doubled, 25-30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F, and brush the tops with the egg wash. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until golden brown on all sides. Remove the loaves from the oven and turn them out onto a rack to cool.

  1 1/2           cups  water
  1             medium  chopped onion

Mix yeast with some warm water and proof (let it sit) for about 30 minutes. After yeast has frothed, dump it in mixing bowl with remainder of water, mashed potatoes, salt, caraway seeds and 4 cups flour. Mix and knead adding flour as necessary. Knead for ten minutes. Let sit covered in floured pot till doubled in size. This takes a few hours.

Beat down. At this point you can add chopped onions, dill, poppy seeds, or whatever you wish to have in the bread. Onions are great. Knead for 7 minutes. Place in pot that has been pam'ed and floured and cover. Let double in size which usually takes less time than the first rise. Moisten (spray) top with a little water and place in 375 oven for 50 minutes. Take out of stove and take bread out of pot at this point. If you let it sit, it can get stuck in pot.

I use a bread pan for 35 minutes, then remove bread from pan and finish on baking tile.

Serves 6-8
Cooking time, 10-15 seconds per batch

Rub the flour and ghee together. Add enough warm water to make a soft dough.
Divide the dough into small brazilnut-sized pieces. Flatten each piece between your palms and roll out on a floured board to small, fairly thin round shapes. Spread out on a clean tea towel.
Deep fry immediately in hot oil, turning once. The purees would normally blow up into a ball as soon as they are put into hot oil, but if they don't, just fry them until they are lightly brown on both sides.

NOTES : When purees are served to guests, they inevitably feel special. The reason for this is the time and patience it takes to roll out each individual puree to a perfect round. They are very versatile as they can be served with any curry dish and are often served with shrikhand as a sweet dish.

  3               cups  cracked rye grains -- (500 gr.)

This bread is very easy to make, in that it requires little work and no kneading at all. The finished bread is extremely heavy, very dark brown, and keeps well for about a week at room temperature. It's not very sour, but has a "dense" flavour that compliments good cheese superbly. We eat it with all kinds of toppings, and rugbroed is the only appropriate bread to have with pickled herrings or pate or coldcut meats in this country. Rugbroed is very similar to German Schwarzbrot (not pumpernickel), also a pure rye flour.

Making rugbroed is quite different from making any other kind of bread. You can't rely on your intuitions about texture or baking times. I've tried to make careful notes during my own baking process to assist first-time rugbroed bakers, but you should be prepared to attempt this a couple of times before giving up. The "difficult" element is getting the baking time and - temperature right, and no two ovens are the same. (After moving to a new apartment this sum- mer, I had to make rugbroed 4 times before I got it "right" again, simply because I had switched from an electric oven to a gas oven.)

If you haven't already got a sourdough starter, you need to allocate a week or so from you start till you are actually eating rugbroed. With a starter on hand it will take three days. (But I think it's worth it.)

Note: I'm including metric measures. I know they don't correspond
exactly to the American units, but if you follow all the metric units consistently, the proportions will be correct.

I'm unsure about some of the ingredients. If you can't find malt beer, use any dark beer (NOT Budweiser) or even just water and some malt powder. When I say "cracked rye" I mean rye kernels that are not whole, but chopped up into about 3-4 pieces on average. You could use whole rye kernels/berries, but then you must allow for at least 8 hours rising time before baking (to soften the kernels). "Rye flour" in the recipe is a rather coarsely ground 100% rye flour - with little bits of grain clearly visible in it. "Graham flour" is 100 % wheat with the texture of corn meal; it's probably called something else in other countries. You could omit it and just use rye flour in its place. The same goes for the cracked wheat (wheat grains chopped coarsely) - replace with cracked rye. But I must say that the presence of a little wheat considerably improves the flavour of the bread.

recipe for one 2-quart size loaf

Sourdough starter:

       1 cup buttermilk     (2 1/2 dl)
       1/2 cup rye flour    (1 1/4 dl)
       1/2 tsp salt

Mix buttermilk, rye flour and salt in a bowl, leave to stand uncovered on the counter. (The amounts are approximate - the mixture should be quite fluid. Add more buttermilk or water if the starter thickens too much.) You can also use a good plain yoghurt instead of buttermilk, but add some water if you do.

Stir the starter with a spoon at least once a day. Keep it loosely covered with paper or foil from the second day. Don't refrigerate.

From the second or third day, you should see little air bubbles forming in the starter, and it will pro- bably have a more grayish colour than it did at first. It should begin to smell slightly sour, but the smell disappears upon stirring.

Usually the starter takes about 5 days to make. It's ready when it has swollen somewhat in volume and the air bubbles are plentiful after resting for 6 hours or so. The quality of the starter is not terribly crucial; rugbroed doesn't (and shouldn't) rise very much during baking.

If mold forms on the starter just scrape it off. It's not of a dangerous kind. (So sayeth Fro, our all-purpose reference cookbook and my bread cookbook.)

If you don't plan to use the starter immediately, cover it tightly and refrigerate. It will keep for several weeks.

Making the sponge:

       sourdough starter (all of it, min. 1/2 cup)         (1 - 2 dl)
       3 cups lukewarm water                               (7.5 dl)
       3/4 cup packed "graham flour" = coarse wheat flour  (125 gr.)
       3/4 cup packed all purpose flour                    (125 gr.)
       1/2 cup flax seeds                                  (75 gr.)
       1/2 cup plain raw sunflower seeds                   (75 gr.)
       1 cup cracked rye grains                            (175 gr.)
       1 1/4 cup cracked wheat grains                      (200 gr.)
       2 tsp. kosher or sea salt (if tablesalt, use less)  (2 tsp)

Note: when making this a second time, omit salt, since it has already been sprinkled on your starter.

Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl, cover with wet towel, and let stand at warm room temperature until next day. (At least 12 hours, but up to 36 hours is fine. Sourness increases with standing, but won't be very predominant in the final result anyway.) Dampen towel when dry to prevent moisture loss from the sponge - which could affect the final result.

(The sponge is very thin and liquid when just mixed, but will quickly become quite thick from the grains absorbing liquid.)

Making the dough:

       1 cup malt beer  (or water + 1 tbsp. malt powder)   (2.5 dl)
       1 tbsp. packed brown sugar (or dark syrup)          (15 ml.)
       1 tsp. ground caraway seeds (optional)              (5 ml.)
       3 cups cracked rye grains                           (500 gr.)


Stir all ingredients together with the starter and pour into a greased loaf pan that will hold 2 quarts (2 liters). If you think you'd like to make this bread again, save 1 cup of dough to use as a starter next time. Put this in a jar, sprinkle with 2 tsp. coarse salt, cover tightly and refrigerate. The dough should be wet and just barely liquid, like a very thick porridge.

Let the bread rise in the loaf pan, covered with a damp towel, for at least 3 hours, or even the whole day, at room temperature. (Warmer if you take the shorter rising time.)

The bread won't rise very much, perhaps only an inch or so.

Paint the top of the bread with melted butter or cold water. Put it in a cold oven and set the temperature at 390 F (200 C). From the time the oven is warm, the baking time is about 90 minutes. If the top looks like it's blackening, cover with tin foil.

It's very difficult to tell when the bread is done. Take it out of the loaf pan and give it a knock on the bottom with your fist. If it doesn't resonate hollowly, it certainly isn't done. If it sounds hollow, insert a bamboo skewer into the middle. If the tip comes out clean, it's _probably_ done. The crust should feel quite hard. If in doubt, leave the bread in the oven as the oven cools.

Don't attempt to slice the bread for at least 10 hours after baking. It's actually best 2 or 3 days old.

Place the bread on a rack and cover with a towel (unless you are leaving it in the oven). Leave it till next day.

Slice rugbroed very thinly (1/4th inch, 0.5 - 0.75 cm) and serve with butter and/or cheese.

>From the day after it's baked, store rugbroed in a bread box or plastic bag at cool room temperature. It freezes quite well, but tends to become a little crumbly after thawing. Rugbroed stays fresh for about a week.

If you have problems:

If the bread seems very wet inside upon slicing, try putting it back in the oven to be warmed through at a fairly low temperature. I think about 1/2 hour at 100 C / 210 F would be appropriate. Even a perfectly baked loaf will be a little sticky the day after it's baked, but it improves over another day or two. If the crust stays extremely hard on the second day, try lowering the oven tem- perature a little and extending baking time the next time you attempt. Much depends on the shape of your loaf pan (wide & flat or short & tall make a world of difference) and on the actual moistness of the dough. I can only recommend that you make careful notes about what you are doing so you know what to adjust a second or third time.

If you like the _taste_ of the bread, but not its crust or wetness the first time, please try making it again. It really is a learning process.

And if you happen to _really_ like this recipe, I think it would be fun if you sent my aunt a postcard. She has no idea what Internet is, but does understand English. (She doesn't even know I've published her recipe here.) Her address is:

NOTES : The virtues of rugbroed are many. The taste & texture are wonderful. It's cheap and simple to make (although you must allow for some trial & error). It's extremely healthy - very low fat, very fibrous, and very good for your digestive system. It's the one thing I missed the most when I lived in the States for a year and didn't have an oven. Delicious! What more can I say? Except that I'm biased, of course.

The following recipe was given to me by my aunt Fro. It's a "modern" version of the ancient staple food of Denmark: Rugbroed (=Ryebread). Traditionally, rugbroed was made only from sourdough, rye flour and water, and the process involved a lot of hard work with kneading. My grandmother still makes rugbroed that way, and the results are delicious, but very different from the recipe below.

  1            package  hot roll mix
     1/4             C  very warm water
  3                     eggs -- at room temperature
     1/4             C  sugar
     1/8           Tsp  saffron threads
  3               Tbsp  butter -- soft

  1 1/2           cups  confectioner's sugar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Sprinkle yeast from the hot roll mix into the warm water in a large bowl. Stir until yeast dissolves. Add eggs, sugar and saffron threads; Beat well until well blended. Beat in about half of the roll mix until smooth. With electric mixer, set at medium speed, beat in the butter until it is absorbed into the dough. Stir in the remaining roll mixture with a spoon, let rise in a warm place, away from any draft, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, pour flavouring over the raisins, and cherries in a small bowl and let stand to soak, stirring often while the dough rises. Stir dough down, then add fruit mixture and almonds. Stir until evenly spread throughout dough. Grease well a 3 Lb shortening tin or 2 1 Lb coffee tins, and turn the dough into these. Cover with a towel and again, let rise for an hour to an hour and a half. When doubled in size, bake in a moderate oven, 350F for about 40 minutes or until the bread is richly brown on top and gives a hollow sound when tapped. Turn out onto a plate to let cool. Pour lemon glaze over the top. letting it dribble down the sides of the bread. Decorate with fruits and nuts if you wish. To serve, cut off the top of the kulich then cut as many round slices as needed. Replace top to prevent bread drying out. Half the rounds and arrange around bread on the plate.

Lemon Glaze
Combine 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar with 1 Tbsp lemon juice in a small cup. Stir with a spoon until smooth and pour over kulich.

: Does anyone out there have any experience making whole grain rye
: bread with NO trace of wheat or added gluten? (With Sourdough or
:            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: Yeast)

: I've tried to bake with whole grain home milled rye flour, but
: So far, I've only managed to create giant sticky blobs,and during
: proofing, the blob just oozes out sideways.

I don't "know" much about making rye bread except how to do it. So I can't really explain what your problem is. I know of two basically different approaches to rye bread. You can either make a regular dough that needs kneading, or a rather thick porridge using whole grains that are left to set via water absorption. (I've posted a recipe of this second type here a few days ago.) Since I don't know what your approach is, I can't comment on your problem, but I can tell you how kneaded rye bread is made in Denmark.

The sourdough we use for rye bread is made from buttermilk and rye flour left uncovered for a day or two, then loosely covered and stirred regularly for another 3-5 days until it smells right. 3/4 cup is enough for a large loaf.

Use water, sourdough, salt and rye flour. Replace some of the water with dark beer for better flavor, or add some malt. Make a dough that is somewhat wetter than for white bread, and let it rest a good half hour or more. On my grandmothers advice:

        1/2 to 1 cup sourdough
        1/2 to 1 Tbsp. sea salt, (or Kosher salt)
        1 cup lukewarm water

Stir these together until well mixed. Add the following:

        1 1/2 pound rye flour, (a fairly coarse grind)

(For those who don't mind wheat: replace slightly under 1/2 pound of the rye with regular all-purpose flour. This will produce a chewier bread with a slightly lighter texture.)

Hold back a little of the rye to see if you need it all. You might need more. Rye flour takes longer to absorb water than wheat flour, and that is why it needs to seem "wet" just after mixing. Leave it in a large, flat bowl to rest (to prevent "oozing"). Then knead the dough on your countertop or in the bowl by punching the middle thin and folding the sides over the middle repeatedly. My grandmother does this for about 10 minutes, and the dough becomes smoother and more elastic as she works it. Don't expect it to achieve the texture of of white bread dough.

Save a 3/4 cup lump of dough at this stage, if you plan to make the bread again. Put in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, sprinkle salt on top, and refrigerate for up to a month.

Shape the dough into an elongated loaf and press it into a well-greased 2 to 2 1/4 quart loaf tin. (If using anything smaller the baking times below will be off.) Run a wet hand over the top, cover with a damp towel, and leave to rise to near double size, typically 4-6 hours, in a warm place.

: What ends up coming out of the oven is more like a giant elongated
: rye falafel, than a loaf of bread. (So far, I've used Yeast rather
: than sourdough, since I am still learning how to handle this stuff
: (Rye))

Run a wet hand over the top of the bread again before placing in heated oven. Bake at a much lower temperature than you would for wheat. 1/2 hour at 200 C followed by 1 1/2 hour at 175 Celsius is probably about right. A bamboo skewer inserted into the middle should come out free of large bits of dough, but slightly sticky to the touch. Take it out of the oven, sprinkle a little cold water on the crust if it seems very hard, and leave to cool on a rack covered by a slightly damp towel.

This traditional bread is supposed to be a little sticky on the inside when it is freshly baked. It is also supposed to be sliced very thinly, revealing a thick, dark crust (which frankly is a little hard on your teeth) and a moist brown bread with many, many little airbubbles. It should taste distinctly sour.

This bread is best at least a day after it is baked. It will keep for a week or so.

: Leonard's "The bread book" instructs to use more water with Rye
: than with wheat, but my experience so far is that exactly the
: opposite is true.


Again, I think you need to be patient before beginning to work the dough. Give the rye time to absorb the water.

: [accidental snip]
: shape the loaf, I pretend the blob is a chunk of clay (it looks
: just like clay) and I use wet hands rather than flour on my hands.

This shouldn't be necessary with the recipe I've given you.

: Any clues would be greatly appreciated!

Experiment, take notes of what you do, and change baking times, temperatures, or wetness of dough next time if you aren't satisfied. Good luck doesn't hurt either. Best wishes...

P.S. Like I said in the other recipe for Danish rye bread, I think it would tremendous fun if you have success with the recipe to send it's creator a postcard. My grandmother would be thrilled. She originally came from the Faroe Islands in the 1930's, taking this recipe with her. I don't know where it originated, but she received it from her older sister with a lump of sourdough before my grandmother set sail for Denmark. Her address is as follows:

           Peder Gydes Vej 57

No obligations, of course. :)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  canola oil

1. Preheat oven to 425F

2. Reserve 1 teaspoon flour and combine remaining flour with salt and baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Add the milk, and mix gently and quickly with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms into a solid mass.

3. Oil an aluminum nonstick baking sheet with canola oil, and place the dough on the sheet. Using a piece of plastic wrap, press and mold the dough to create a round load about 7 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Remove wrap. Sprinkle top of dough with the reserved flour. Using a serrated knife, make an "x" in center, 1/4-inch deep, and nearly the entire diameter.

4. Place a stainless steel bowl upside down over the bread, and place it in the 425F for 30 minutes. Uncover, and cook at the same temperature for another 30 minutes.

5. Using a side spatula, remove the bread from the baking sheet and set it aside to cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.

COMMENTS: When pressed for time, soda bread is the perfect solution. This British classic requires only a few minutes of work to put together. ... No proofing is necessary, the bread should be baked immediately after it is assembled for the baking powder to work effectively.

Soda bread is conventionally made with buttermilk and baking soda, but Jacques achieves the same result with regular milk and baking powder. If you want to make the classic version, use the same amounts of buttermilk and baking soda.

The trick: covering the dough with an inverted stainless steel bowl during the first 30 minutes of baking creates a moist environment in which it can rise. Then, after the bowl is removed, the crust of the bread hardens and browns.

NOTE: Irish bread is still baked in a deep kettle, over a peat fire, in a hearth stand. The walls of the kettle provide moisture. Sometimes, the kettle is covered for the first 20 to 30 minutes. -Time Life's Cooking of the British Isles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                cup  Boiling Water -- 4 cup
     1/2           cup  Wheat Berries -- 3/4 cup
  3               cups  Sour -- 4 1/2 cups
     1/2          tbsp  Sugar -- 1/2 tbsp
  2                pkg  yeast -- 3 pkg
     1/2           cup  rye flour -- 3/4 cup
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour -- 3/4 cup
  1               tbsp  salt -- 1 1/2 tbsp
  1                cup  warm water -- 1 1/2 cup
  1                cup  milk -- 1 1/2 cup
                        chopped onions

Allow to stand for two hours to soften the berries.  Proof the yeast as
follows:
      1/2  cup warm water,3/4 cup
     1 TBSP sugar,1 1/2 TBSP
     2 packages active dry yeast,3 pkg yeast
While the yeast is proofing, combine in a bowl:
     1/3 cup rye flour,1/2 cup
     1/3  cup whole-meal, whole-wheat flour,1/2 cup
     3 cups white flour,4 1/2 cups
     the drained wheat berries, and
     1  TBSP salt,1 1/2 TBSP
Add:
     the proofed yeast mixture from above,  1 (1 1/2) cup of warm milk, and
 1 (1 1/2) cup of warm water.

(Note that you may use the water that was used to soak the wheat berries.) Knead well for about 10 minutes, adding additional: white flour about 1/2
cup at a time. You may need to add 3 more (4 1/2) cups, give or take a bit.

Form into a ball, place in greased bowl covered. Rise until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour.
Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut in two, form loaves, and allow to
rise again.
You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl. If so,
James feels that the bread may need some help in the second rising, in the form of a bit of heat.
As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 F. oven. This bread should have a good crunchy crust. Can make without wheat berries.




                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : This is basically the wheat berry bread of Mrs. Elizabeth Ovenstadt, but I have set it up to use my sour instead of just water.  Good taste.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Butter a 2 quart baking dish. In a 3 quart saucepan heat milk, salt, sugar and butter to boiling point. Slowly whisk in cornmeal and stir with a wooden spoon for a few minutes so the corn swells up; mixture should be thick.

Beat in baking powder and baking soda, transfer this mix to a mixing bowl and beat in buttermilk, scallions and corn and egg yolks, one at a time.

Cool mix to room temperature, whip egg whites until stiff and fold into corn batter along with jalapenos. Bake 40 minutes or until top is puffy. Spoon out onto plates alongside pork chops.

Combine the flour, oil and enough warm water to form a soft dough.

Mince the mircha and adrak and chop the dhunia finely. Mix with the remaining ingredients and form into walnut sized stuffing balls.

Divide the dough into slightly larger balls. Make a hole in the middle of a ball of dough and place a ball of stuffing inside. Bring the dough round to cover the stuffing completely. Seal well and roll out on a lightly floured board into a flat round shape, approximately 5 inches in diameter.

Set a heavy based frying pan over a medium heat and shallow fry the parathas using 1 Tbsp of oil at a time. Turn the parathas and cook the other side. They should be crisp and golden on the outside.

  3                  c  bread flour
  4               tbsp  rolled oats

When your machine says it is time to add stuff or 5 or 10 minutes before second kneading is complete, add: 3 tbsp dark raisins and 1/3 c pecans. Notes from Prodigy contributer: "I add a few more raisins than this and 1 tsp cinnamon. Bake on light or medium cycle (I use medium). I've been using 1 minute Quaker Oats and Canola margarine. I like yams best.

Original recipe from Ultimate Bread Machine Cookbook by Tom Lacalamita. Seems I always need a little more flour than this calls for so just add it to where it cleans the pan. Follow your ABM's directions for order of the ingredients."

NOTES : This is good and healthy bread- the sweet potatoes provide lots of beta- carotene. You will probably have to watch the liquid more closely on this one, as it's likely that the potatoes will vary in how moist they are.

  1 1/2          pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  2          envelopes  fast-rising yeast
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2            cup  (3 sticks) unsalted butter -- melted
  1                cup  honey
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2                     eggs -- beaten to blend
  2          teaspoons  salt

  4               cups  (about) whole wheat flour
  4               cups  graham cracker crumbs

Cook potatoes in large saucepan of simmering water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Place potatoes in medium bowl. Transfer reserved cooking liquid to large bowl; cool to 120F. to 130F.

Combine potatoes, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup honey, oil, eggs and salt in processor. Blend until smooth. Add to yeast mixture. Mix in all purpose flour. Gradually stir in enough whole wheat flour 1/2 cup at a time to form soft, slightly sticky dough. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding more whole wheat flour if sticky.

Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl with kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400F. Grease three 9-inch-diameter cake pans. Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Divide dough into thirds. Cut each third into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into ball. Mix remaining 1 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup honey until well blended. Dip each dough ball into honey mixture and then roll in graham cracker crumbs to coat. Place 12 balls in each prepared pan, arranging close together. Let stand 10 minutes. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. (Rolls can be prepared ahead. Cool completely. Wrap tightly and refrigerate 1 day or freeze up to 1 month. Reheat rolls before serving.) Serve warm.

Makes 3 dozen

                         Tajik Flatbread ("Non")

Recipe By     :Eating Well, May/June 1995,Jeffery Alford and Naomi Dugid
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads                          Daily Bread Mailing List
                Hand Made                       International Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         Tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           Cup  warm water
  2               Cups  lowfat yogurt -- plain
  5               Cups  whole-wheat flour -- (5 to 6)
  1         Tablespoon  salt
  4          Teaspoons  shallots -- finely chopped
  2          Teaspoons  cumin seed

Dissolve yeast in the water in a large bowl. In a saucepan or microwave oven, heat the yogurt until it feels warm on the inside of your wrist (about 105 F) and stir it into the yeast mixture. Stir in 3 cups of the flour, one cup at a time. Stir 100 times in the same direction to properly develop the gluten. Let stand 10 minutes.

Sprinkle salt over the dough and stir to mix well. Stir in additional flour until dough will take no more and cannot be stirred. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead, incorporating any flour as necessary until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes (it will remain somewhat sticky). Transfer dough to a large oiled bowl, turn to coat, cover with plastic wrap and let rest until doubled in volume (about 1 1/2 hours). Set an unglazed baking stone or lightly oiled baking sheet on the bottom over rack and preheat oven to 450F. Gently punch down the dough and let rest for another 10 minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.

Lightly flour your palms and flatten each piece; set them aside, covered with a damp towel.

Roll out each bread, beginning by spreading 1/2 teaspoon of the shallots and 1/4 teaspoon of the cumin in a 5-inch circle on the work surface. Take a piece of dough and set it on top of the shallots and cumin. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough until it about 8 inches in diameter. (If it sticks, lightly flour the surface)

Turn the rolled-out circle of dough over so the shallots and cumin are on top. With a fork, repeatedly prick the center of the circle, leaving an untouched rim about 3 inches wide. this allows the bread to bake with a slightly higher outside ring, like a pizza crust. Roll out the remaining pieces of dough similarly.
Depending on the size of your baking surface, bake 2 or 3 breads at one time. Use your hands or a flour-dusted pizza peel to carefully transfer the prepared dough to the heated baking surface. Bake for only 2 1/2 to 3 minutes -- baked through but still quite soft. Remove from the oven and stack immediately and wrap in a clean towel.

Mix raisins and vanilla and let stand at least one hour. Drain well, reserving the vanilla to use as part of the liquid. You may combine the raisins and the vanilla then microwave on HIGH for one minute, rather than soaking them for an hour. Note: For this recipe only, I usually use imitation vanilla extract. Add raisins and/or nuts at beep. You can purchase it by the jug at Costco or Sams. Converted by MC_Buster by Marcia Fasy <mfasy@usa.net>

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  oatmeal

     1/2           tsp  yeast
  3               cups  warm water -- (about)

An hour before bedtime, grind oats into flour in a blender, food processor or spice(coffee) grinder.

Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add the water to make the dough. Knead it until smooth and elastic. Put it back in the unwashed bowl. Cover with a damp towel (or oiled plastic wrap, if you must.)

The next morning, punch down the dough. Shape into two loaves and put in oiled or buttered pans. Cover with a floured towel (or oiled or buttered plastic wrap, if you must.) Leave at room temp.

When you come home from work, put the pans in the oven and turn it on to 400F. Bake about 45-50 minutes. (about 40 minutes in a preheated oven, but why preheat?) Test for doneness by thumping on the bottom; it should sound hollow. Or test with an instant read thermometer for 200F. If not done return to oven (no need to put back in pans) and recheck in 5 minutes.

  9               ozs.  water
  1 1/2   tablespoons.  salt
  1       tablespoons.  oil
  2       tablespoons.  sugar
     1/4           cup  wheat bran
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
  1                cup  whole wheat flour -- I like King Arthur)
  1 1/2            cup  unbleached white flour -- still King Arthur
  3       tablespoons.  gluten
                        -- I get from health store
  1 1/2                 tps. yeast
                        -- I also get loose from health store

I make up the dry ingredients ahead of time and keep in jars ready, all except the salt. It should go in the water first. When everything is ready in the machine, then you add the yeast, DO NOT add it to your dry ingredients ahead of time. Add it by itself.

I use the time for the regular loaf, not whole wheat,
and cook it on Medium.  On my machine it takes a total of 2 + 1/2 hours.
