NOTES : I have a very good "faux" sourdough recipe that my family loves.  It
uses sour cream (can be non-fat) and vinegar (instead of yogurt and lemon
juice).  Think you might like to try it.

"The Complete Book of Bread Machine Baking", edited by Lara Pizzorno

I don't know where they get the title since this is not 100% WW.  However, I
have been told that this is the best bread that I have made so far by two
different sources.  The crust has a nice crunch and the bread is light with a
delicious flavor.
This book emphasizes healthy breads, that is why they suggest canola instead
of vegetable oil, unbleached flour instead of all purpose flour, and why they
add wheat germ.  I don't doubt that you can easily substitute.

degrees for 35 minutes.  Remove from pan right away and cool on cooling rack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           Cup  Whole almonds -- with skins
     1/2           Cup  Plain low-fat yogurt
  1 1/2           Cups  Brown rice flour
     1/2           Cup  Water
  4          Teaspoons  Baking powder
  1              Large  Egg -- Whole
     1/4      Teaspoon  Salt
  1              Large  Egg White
  3          Teaspoons  Poppy seeds
  2        Tablespoons  Vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.

 Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and
grind until a fine meal is formed--the flour will prevent the nuts from
turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt and 2
teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.

 Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2- cup measuring cup.

 With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed tube
over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix.

 Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds, and
bake for 55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices best after
several hours, or the next day).

 Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

  10                    eggs
  4 1/2           cups  sugar -- (4.5 to 5), sifted
  4               cups  flour -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  anise flavor

Beat eggs over warm water until thick and lemon colored, about 10 to
15 minutes.  Add sugar gradually, beating constantly, until all the
sugar has been used up.  Mix in the flour, one cup at a time, until
the mixture is well blended.  Add vanilla and anise flavor.  Turn into
well greased and lightly floured long narrow baking tins.  Bake in a
preheated 375F oven until delicately browned.  Watch carefully, so that
the sweet bread does not burn.  If the oven is too hot reduce to 350F.
Cool.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Slice 1/2 inch thick, spread on
a baking sheet, return to 250F oven and let toast gently for 10 min.
or until a very light golden color.

NOTES : This is very OLD European recipe was a gift to us from a famous chef.
The bread is lightly flavored, crisp and sweet.  Uniquely delicate, it
is an excellent "dunker," served with steaming hot coffee or spice tea.
The ladies often dipped the sliced Vienna bread i cognac or sweet wine
- --the very nicest way imaginable of having your cake and eating it too!

This is from the Complete Bread Cookbook.  This would also qualify for the pre 1940 thread as it is very old.  It states it is a bread, but what I think we actually have here, is a toasted cake.  It has no levening, which is interesting, and is reputed to have be shared, as a gift, from a Vienna Baker.

                Starter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Starter:
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  2 1/2              C  Warm Water
  2                  C  Flour -- Sifted
  1               Tbsp  Sugar

For starter:
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C of the warm water in a deep glass
or plastic container.  Stir in remaining warm water, flour
and sugar.  Beat until smooth.  Cover with loose fitting cover.
DO NOT REFRIGERATE!

The starter requires 10 days for fermentation as follows:

DAY S 1, 2, 3 and 4:	Stir batter

DAY 5:			Add 1 C. each milk, flour, sugar and stir

DAYS 6, 7, and 8:	Stir batter each day

DAY  10:		Add 1 C each flour, sugar, milk; stir.

The batter is ready to use.

This makes 3 cups batter to use in the recipes.
If you want to you may pout 1 C. batter each into 3 containers
and give 1 or 2 away.

Save 1 C. to begin process all over again OR you can use all
3 cups batter for the recipes at 1 time and when you want to bake
these again just start the starter again.

OR use the other cup of batter to make the bread or cake.

NOTES : Sue Klein sent me her anadama recipe to convert to the abm. I did and she
enjoyed it saying it was one of the best ones she tasted so far. Here is her
recipe/ my conversion with minor changes. The bread is a med loaf, semi
coarse grain, moist texture, good crisp crust with great flavor. It was
wonderful warm and made great toast the next day.She and I still have ideas
to even improve it more, but it a great one as a base recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  Water
     3/4           tsp  yeast -- ***see note***
  6               cups  flour -- * (6 to 7)
  1 1/4            cup  cornmeal
  2 1/2            tsp  sea salt -- (table salt can be
                        substituted)
  3               tbsp  corn oil -- (must use corn for
                        best flavor)
  3               tbsp  molasses

1> Proof yeast in 1/4 cup  of the water with 1 tsp flour.
2> Sift cornmeal with 3 1/2 cups of flour, stir into yeast and remaining
water.  Stir 100 times, then cover with towel and let sponge.  (After 1 hour
or so, air pockets will form, looking like a sponge.)
3> Stir in salt, oil & molasses.  Gradually stir in enough remaining flour
until dough is formed.  Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes.  Place in
greased bowl, turn, cover and let rise until double.  (1 1/2 - 2 hours)
4> Punch down, let rise again until double ( 1 - 1 1/2 hours).
5> Punch down, form into two loaves. Place in greased pans sprinkled with
cornmeal. Let rise until double, about 1 hour.    Slash tops, brush with egg
wash and bake at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes or until internal temp is
190 degrees.

NOTE: If eliminating sponge step, use 2 tsp yeast.  Entire process can be
done in a large food processor or Kitchenaid for ease.

  1 1/2              C  Water -- (1C)

Note: The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg loaf
and (1T) for the smaller loaf.  I omitted it.  Could use Wonderslim or
possibly applesauce instead.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.  Let the loaf cool before slicing.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  raisins -- (added at the beeps
                        to keep them whole) (1/2 to 1)

This stuff makes the most fantastic toast.  It's also not bad
untoasted.  We have made it successfully making the bread as listed,
but adding only 1 Tbsp of white sugar and no cinnamon at the beginning,
and then adding a cinnamon/brown sugar mixture 30 s. or a minute before
the end of the last kneading cycle.  The sugar/cinnamon ends up marbled
through the bread, and it is wonderful  (hard to get right though)

                              Apricot Bagel

Categories    : Bagels                          Bread Machine
                Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Dough Cycle
                Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/8           Cups  water
  2          Teaspoons  orange extract -- optional
  1         Tablespoon  olive oil
  2        Tablespoons  malt powder -- or honey / sugar
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  3 1/3           Cups  bread flour
  1         Tablespoon  wheat gluten -- optional
  2          Teaspoons  yeast
     3/4           Cup  dried apricots -- diced

Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed.  Use the dough
setting. Add the apricots 5 minutes before the end of the kneading phase or work
into the dough before shaping.  If you don't have a dough setting stop the
machine after the rises.

Prepare the baking sheets or use nonstick sheets.
Remove dough from the machine, punch it down, and roll it out into a rectangle
about 14 x 18.  Divide into equal pieces and shape into bagel form or use a
cutter.  Place the bagels on the sheets and let them rise again.  I put them in
the oven to provide a draft free location.

This rise can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending on what else is
going on in your life.

Fill a 4 to 6 qt soup pot with water 3 to 4 " deep.  You can add 2 T of malt
syrup, honey, sugar or non-diastatic malt powder.  Get the water to boiling.

Preheat the oven to 400.

Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water.  Boil only 3 or 4 at a
time so they don't crowd.  Simmer each side for a minute and return to the
baking sheet.

Add glazes or toppings as desired.

Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven.  The book calls for
20 to 25 minutes.  I usually start at 15 minutes for the 1st sheet and less for
the second.

These are best eaten while they are still warm.  They can be frozen - you may
want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster.

Serving Ideas : for peach bagels sub dried peaches for the apricots

NOTES : I use orange oil instead of the orange extract.
These are really excellent.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             Ounces  water
  1              Large  egg
  1 1/4      Teaspoons  salt
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
  3             Ounces  Asiago Cheese -- 1 C Lightly Packed
                         -- Finely Shredded
  1              Ounce  Romano Cheese -- Or Parmesan,
                         -- Generous 1/3 C
     1/2           Cup  yellow cornmeal
  2 3/4           Cups  Bread Flour -- or unbleached flour
  2          Teaspoons  active dry yeast


Place all ingredients in pan of bread machine in order listed, or in the
order recommended for your machine. Set controls for Basic bread with
medium crust and start machine. Makes one 1 1/2-pound loaf.

I created this bread in response to a recent request on this list, and also
because I wanted to make a cheese bread using some of the excellent Asiago
cheese that we sell at our food co-op.  This bread has an *absolutely
wonderful* aroma while it's baking.  I've made it twice and it has already
become my husband's new all-time favorite bread.  It's definitely worth the
extra effort to use freshly grated cheeses.  The cornmeal adds some body
and helps make a crisper crust, but if you can't eat corn, leave it out and
add more flour (start with 1/4 cup flour and add more if needed).

  9             Ounces  water
  2        Tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/4      Teaspoons  salt
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
  3             Ounces  Asiago cheese -- finely shredded,

  1              Ounce  Parmesan Cheese -- shred, or Romano,
                        -- (generous 1/3 C)
     1/2    Tablespoon  Caraway Seeds -- (optional)

  2 3/4           Cups  bread flour -- or unbleached flour
  2          Teaspoons  active dry yeast

Place all ingredients in pan of bread machine in order listed, or
in the order recommended for your machine. (I usually toss the grated
cheese with the cornmeal before adding it to the pan, to decrease
clumping.) Set controls for Basic bread with medium crust and start
machine. Makes one 1.5-pound loaf.
        NOTE: This bread makes wonderful garlic toast. After cutting it,
spray very lightly with olive oil from your EcoPump, then sprinkle
generously with granulated garlic powder. Toast in oven until as brown as
you like it.
        (The rainforest-friendly EcoPump is a spray bottle that you fill
half-way with oil, then pump in air using the special top--like a bicycle
pump--so you get the benefits of a fine aerosol mist without any chemicals.
If you can't find one where you live, contact California Olive Oil Corp.,
134 Canal Street, Salem, MA 01970  Tel. 508-745-7840; Fax 508-744-3492.
I'm not related to this company in any way--but I have three EcoPumps and
use them every day.)

NOTES : Here is an updated version of the Asiago Cheese Bread I posted to this list
several months ago. The original version had an egg but no oil; I like the
flavor of this version better.  I have also recently tried replacing 1 cup
of the bread flour with Gold-n-White flour, which has all the wheat germ of
whole wheat flour but not the bran.  (I added 1 tablespoon of gluten flour
along with the Gold-n-White.)  This flour added another layer of flavor to
the bread which I liked very much.

This French yeast bread,  adapted from the  Austrian Guglehuph, was  originally
name Ali Baba,  after a hero  in the book,  "The Thousand and  One Nights."   A
coffee bread made  extra moist  with Rum  Syrup spooned  over.   Could also  be
served for dessert.

Before the end of the secondary  kneading, the electronic beeper will sound  10
times.  At this signal, add rum sauce mixture.

Prepare Syrup:  In small  saucepan, bring sugar and  water to a boil,  stirring
occasionally.  Remove from heat;  add rum.  Spoon over  warm bread.  (For  more
penetration, puncture bread with fork.)  Serve warm or cold.

  2               Cups  bread flour
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  sugar
  1           Teaspoon  salt
     3/4           Cup  water
  1         Tablespoon  barley malt syrup
  2        Tablespoons  poppy seeds -- *NOTE


*NOTE sesame seeds, kosher salt, or minced onion, or whatever!

1.  Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the
    order suggested by your bread machine.  Process on the manual cycle.

2.  At the end of the cycle, remove the dough from the machine.  Preheat the
    oven to 375 degrees.  In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil.

3.  While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces.  Roll
    each piece into a rope 12 inches long.  Make a circle of each piece,
    overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or rolling the
    overlap tightly to seal.  Let the bagels rise for only 5 minutes.

4.  Add the malt syrup to the boling water.  Lower the bagels a few at a time
    into the water.  As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove them with
    a spatula and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle with
    .75 teaspoon of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake for
    20 minutes, or until golden.

NOTES:

    I couldn't find barley malt syrup, so I used molasses.  It seems to work
    in almost the same way.

    I make 4 bagels out of this recipe, instead of 8.  They seem to be the
    same size as the kind you would buy in the store if there are 4 of them.
    If you want them smaller, make 8.

Enjoy!

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  Water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Salt
  2               Cups  Bread flour
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  Honey
  1                Cup  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Yeast

Let the machine knead the dough once, and then let the dough rise 20
minutes only in the machine.  Even if your cycle runs longer, simply
remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine.  Divide the
dough into the appropriate number of pieces.  Roll each piece into a
rope and make it into a circle, pressing the ends together.  You may
find it necessary to wet one end slightly to help seal the ends
together.  Place shaped dough on a well greased baking sheet, cover
and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, bring about 2 inches
of water to a slight boil in a non-aluminum pan.  Carefully lower
about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for about 30
seconds on each side.  Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle with
poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried onion bits, etc., and place on the
greased baking sheet.  Bake in a pre-heated 550 degree oven for 8
minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry yeast
  2                tsp  salt
                        sugar
  4               cups  flour -- (4 to 4.5)
  1                cup  water -- Boiling potato wate
  2        tablespoons  salad oil
  3                     eggs

Combine yeast, salt, 2 teaspoons sugar and 1 1/2 cups flour in
a large bowl.  Heat potato water and salad oil in saucepan over
low heat until very warm (120 - 130F).  At low speed, beat this
liquid into dry ingredients until just blended.  Increase speed
to medium and beat 2 minutes, scraping down bowl.  Beat in 2 eggs
and 1/2 cup flour to form a thick batter.  Beat 2 minutes and
scrape down bowl.  Stir in about 2 cups flour to make a soft dough.
Knead on lightly floured board until smooth and elastic, about 10
minutes.  Add more flour while kneading, as needed.  Shape dough
into ball and place in greased bowl; turn dough over to grease top.
Cover with moist towel and rise in warm place until double, about
1 1/2 hours.

Punch down dough and cut dough into 16 pieces on lightly floured
surface.  Cover with moist towel and rest for 20 minutes.  Roll
each piece into 8 inch long strip.  Form into rings and place 2 inches
apart on 2 greased cookie sheets.  Cover with moist towel and let
rise in warm place for 30 minutes (dough will NOT be doubled).

Preheat oven to 425F.  In a 12 inch skilled, bring 1 inch of water
and 2 tablespoons sugar to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to
medium and drop a few rings in at a time and simmer for 3 minutes,
turning once.  Remove rings to paper towels.  Drain.  Place on cookie
sheets.  Beat remaining egg slightly and brush over rings.  Bake
20 to 25 minutes until light brown.  Cool 5 minutes on wire rack.
Cut in half across the width and toast to serve.

Makes 16 bagels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  oatmeal
     1/2           cup  brown sugar -- (1/2 to 1)
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2           Ts.  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  applesauce
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2                     Egg Beaters(r) 99% egg substitute -- Or Equiv
  1                cup  skim milk
     1/2           cup  Raisins -- (1/2 To 1),
                         -- Or Blueberries


Not exactly bread, but it is very good, thought I'd share it.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl.  Mix the wet
ingredients in another bowl.  Stir the wet and dry ingredients together and add
the raisins or blueberries.  Spread in a 9x9 pan, lightly sprayed with nonstick
spray.  Bake 20-30 minutes.  Serve as-is, or top with some sort of milk.

Notes: This turns out almost like a cake.  One cup of sugar made it way too
sweet for me; I'll use 1/2 cup next time. I did use egg substitute and had
good results.

  2 1/4      Teaspoons  Yeast
                        Dry group:
     1/2           Cup  gluten
  1                Cup  kamut flour
     3/4           Cup  brown rice flour
  2        Tablespoons  brown rice flour

  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

  2        Tablespoons  canola oil
  1         Tablespoon  molasses
     1/2      Teaspoon  nutmeg -- or a bit more
  1 1/3           Cups  banana -- very ripe, mashed
     1/2      Teaspoon  lecithin -- (optional)
  1 1/4      Teaspoons  salt
     3/4           Cup  walnuts -- pieces and halves

Here is another Banana bread recipe.  It is wheat starch free, but contains
gluten, and tastes marvelous.  This recipe is for a Breadman machine;
adapt as necessary.  Be sure to mix in the gluten until very well
distributed, as described.  I keep all my flours in the refrigerator, and
warm the mixed flours in the microwave just before starting the bread.

Measure "Dry Group" ingredients into mixing bowl, stir until well blended to evenly distribute the
gluten, either let come to room temperature or warm in microwave until
slightly warm.

Toast the walnuts for 7 minutes at 275 degrees and
cool a bit. Add the nuts 8 minutes before end of knead cycle.

I wasn't sure how much water I would need so I added half a cup at the
start then poured in some more once the mixing was underway - enough
to make the usual consistency.  The loaf rose really well and tastes a treat.

NOTES : This recipe has TOO MUCH LIQUID! I tried the 1 lb. loaf, and it
mixed up in the machine much more like a batter than a bread--
I had to add an extra 3/4 cup of flour before it formed a ball.

With the extra flour it baked up nicely. The bread was sort of moist
and heavy, very banana-y, not very sweet. Really pretty good.

Next time, however, I think I would cut back the banana for the small
loaf to 1/2 cup, use 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 cups flour, and perhaps increase
the sugar to 2 tablespoons. [Iva S. Maclennan]

NOTES : The following is the best (and most forgiving) banana bread recipe I've come
across.  Don't recall where I got the original, but have modified it quite a
bit, so it is pretty much my own.  I use it if I happen to have some grossly
over ripe bananas on hand, and if not, try to go to a grocery which has a mark
down produce section for them.  The key to really good banana flavor is using
very, very ripe bananas.  If it is almost black, mushy and oozing juice, it is
perfect for the bread.  Enjoy!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  water
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  banana -- ripe, mashed
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar

  4        tablespoons  dried buttermilk
  1                cup  quick-cooking oats
  2 1/2           cups  flour -- unbleached
     1/3           cup  steel-cut oats -- soaked in:
     1/3           cup  boiling water -- until room temp.
  1         tablespoon  active yeast

Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for Bread, Basic Bread, Basic Wheat, Basic, White, White/Whold Grain, or Whte Bread, and press Start or On.

I've added all different kinds of dried fruit (apricots, dried
cherries, raisin s) to this and that comes out great.  Add 1/2 cup of
chopped fruit whenever you normally add raisins (if you have a raisin
bread cycle then at the beep. That's my only complaint with the
Panasonic--I think I did it last time around 2:40 left in the whole
wheat cycle, and it came out ok, for those of you that also have the
Panasonic).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 Lb Loaf:
     3/4           Cup  water -- 80 to 90 degrees
     3/4           Cup  banana -- finely mashed
  2               Tbsp  oil
  1               Tbsp  lemon juice
  3               Cups  bread flour -- PLUS
  1                Tsp  salt
  3               Tbsp  sugar
  2                Tsp  Yeast -- Instant
     1/4           Cup  walnuts -- coarse chop

Follow manufacturer instructions for ingredient placement. Use regular white
bread cycle. Initially dough may be too wet so add more flour gradually to
achieve a soft pliable dough ball. Add nuts during the last kneading cycle.

Note: you could add a bit of cinnamon or a tsp of banana extract.
I havent tried brown sugar to replace white sugar, could be possibility.

Make sure bananas are ripe for best flavor.

Let bread cool completely for best slicing.

NOTES : Light fluffy, high riser in my toastmaster bread machine.It more of a white bread with suble banana flavor. Its a large bread, should rise to top of pan, so don't try this in a small capacity  machine or it could overflow.

  2             Quarts  warm water

  8             Ounces  Active Dry Yeast
  7             Pounds  Bread Flour -- To 8 Lbs


Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and  mix together holding back on some of the flour until you see that it is needed. Knead dough 5-10 minutes or until dough is smooth. Cover and let rise until double in size.
Punch down and form into desired shapes-baquettes,round loaves etc. Bake at 375*  20-30 minutes depending on loaf size.   By adding fresh chopped herbs and some roasted garlic to this dough you can come up with some very flavory breads.

  1 1/3              C  Water -- (3/4 C + 2 T)

*NOTE:  The original recipe used 1 1/2 T vegetable oil (1 T).

A moist and chewy loaf like this one makes good peanut butter, tuna, or
fresh ham sandwiches and excellent toast.  It goes well with vegetable and
meat soups, especially Scotch broth.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.  Eat warm - but not hot - or cool.

For the dough I used:
(more or less on the quantities)
1 cup white flour
2 cups whole wheat
1 teaspoon yeast
1 cup sour dough
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup water
and then watch it if you need more water or more flour

By the way I use these same things and quantities to make my bread.
In the bread I add various things, for instance caraway seeds, or garlic, or
raisins, whatever I feel like
The bread always comes out good.
So this is my always recipe for bread or dough.

                            Basic Bread Sponge

                Fatfree                         Starter
                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           Cups  water -- 105-115 degrees
  4               Cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached

Whisk the yeast into the water.  Allow to sit for about three minutes.
Add the flour, mixing for another three minutes.  Place in a nonreactive
bowl and cover.  Allow to sit in a draft-free spot until it rises and gets
thick and sticky.  This will take about eight hours.

Use a spoon to stir the sponge down before measuring for use in a bread.

Once risen, refrigerate for up to three days.  Allow to come to room
temperature before using.  If it goes beyond three days, discard all but 1
cup of the sponge and make the recipe, adding the reserved sponge with the
flour.  Stir for two or three minutes before using.

For all of the breads based upon this sponge, allow two days since the
doughs require overnight refrigeration.

For the best results, use as little of the kneading flour as possible.

To allow yourself to slide the loaves into the oven, form them on a baking
sheet without sides or on the bottom of one with sides that is turned
upside-down.

If you do not have a stone or tiles, bake directly on the baking sheet(s)
upon which you formed the loaves (be sure to use either cornmeal or
parchment between the dough and the sheet).

All of the breads based upon the sponge can be frozen for up to two weeks.
 Don't freeze until the bread has cooled thoroughly - then wrap in foil
and freeze.  When ready to use, thaw them, still wrapped, at room
temperature overnight.  Then, unwrap and warm at 350 degrees for 5 or 10
minutes.  Alternatively, you could warm the frozen and wrapped loaves at
300 for 35 to 40 minutes.

This airy, crusty, loaf is perfect sandwich bread fro tuna fish, peanut
butter or lettuce and tomato.  If you don't slice it too thick, it will even
fit into a low-calorie diet.  Since this recipe has no shortening, the bread
will turn stale, after only one day, but it will still make fine toast,
especially good for a fried egg sandwich.

Variation I used:
Decreased the bread flour to 2 1/2 C and added 1/2 C yellow cornmeal.
Added 2 T sesame seeds

It really made it a totally different bread.

>From: kmc@walking_tall (Karen Pantano  - Sun BOS)

Notes from Warren.Clark@East.Sun.COM:

Here is the recipe I always use;  It was recommended to me and
we really love it.

My wife and I are great pizza lovers and for months I was
frustrated by inability to make pizza dough - manually or
using the bread machine.  The secret for me turned out to be
only kneading for 4 minutes or so.  Any more than that causes
too much gluten to be produced and the bread forms a memory.
You flatten it out and it springs back into a ball.  The more
you flatten it the faster it springs back into the ball.
Whole wheat is a lot more tolerant of over kneading.

The recipe is designed for "the old fashioned hand made method."
I usually scale it up by 50% - i.e. 3 cups of flour.  I don't
increase the yeast, but everything else goes up too.

I dump the dry ingredients into the machine.  Then I mix the wet ones
together, dump them in and press start.  (Sometimes I sprinkle
in a TBS or two of flour if it is tool loose.  You don't want
it to be too sticky whne you take it out.

After FOUR MINUTES, I hit the CLEAR button to stop it.

If it is warm in the room, I
leave it in the machine for 30-60 minutes until it rises.  If not,
I take it out of the machine and put it into a greased bowl.
I roll the dough around to cover it with oil, cover it with
a damp towel, and put it someplace warm.

After it doubles in volume, I break it into 2 or 3 pieces and form
the pizza crusts.  I work on a floured counter top.  Avoid anything
like kneading since even a small amount of manipulation will
cause it to get springy.

I use a pizza stone in the oven and give the pizza stone plenty of
time to get really warm - maybe 30 minutes.  Then I cook it for
20 - 25 minutes at 425.  Most recipes call for 450, but I prefer
not to have the top burned.  Maybe my oven is off.

*NOTE: semolina, or unbleached all-purpose flour

  What I like to do is make up the sauce the night before and set the timer
to have the dough ready when I get home after work. Then it's a fairly quick
and simple task to make the pizza for dinner.

Here's a good basic pizza dough recipe from a Julia Child cookbook that coincidentally is perfect in the DAK breadmaker...

I sometimes throw in a little cornmeal for a nice effect too. I highly
recommend the combination we made last night - a pizza with a thin
layer of ricotta cheese, a good amount of mozzerella, a decent sprinkling
of smoked salmon (it was really a tiny amount, just a few ounces)
and some fresh thyme. Throw it on the pizza stone which has been heating
in the oven at 425 (about 10-15 minutes of pre-heating) and then cook
for abou;t 10 minutes or until the top has started to brown.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                pkg  yeast
  3               cups  flour
  1              tblsp  sugar
  1                tsp  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1                cup  plain yogurt -- heated
                        -- or sour cream or buttermilk
     1/2           cup  warm water

She claims that the yogurt keeps the bread moist longer (doesn't
crumble as much). I've made it and it's good. She mentioned to me
a while ago about reading that commercial bakers use emulsifiers
to prevent crumbly bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  325                g  Bakers Flour -- (can use 100% whole
                        meal OK)
  220                g  Water -- (plus/minus 5g)
  40                 g  Olive Oil -- (can vary between
                        -- 10g and 80g)
  2              grams  Improver
  40             grams  Sugar -- (can vary between
                        -- 15g and 80g)
  10             grams  milk powder
                        -- 5g and 30g)
  7              grams  Salt
  4              grams  Yeast

Additives for variety requiring no change to basic list

Allspice up to        7g OK
Cinnamon up to        7g OK
Dried Currents up to 60g OK
Chile to taste
Orange and Lemon Zest to taste   (grated fresh outer peel)
Cake and Bun improver  5 drops

        Additives which require corrections to basic recipe

Eggs - reduce water by the weight of the egg(s)
Fruit - reduce water by estimating water content of fruit
Fruit Juice - reduce water by weight of juice

        Additives which failed (too little rise)

Nutmeg - did it kill the yeast or destroy the natural gluten?
Rye flour - OK up to about 20% of flour but height lost

        Care of Yeast

I purchase 500g of Instant Dried Yeast at a time. Fill 2 small coffee jars
and store one sealed with glad wrap in the freezer. The other one is stored
in the frig with a sealed plastic lid. When the first jar is finished, allow
the second, frozen jar to reach frig temperature in the frig before use (to
reduce the condensation). There is some small deterioration of the second
jar towards the end of the batch. I increase the yeast used by up to 10% to
counter this. The adjustment is made as a result of the previous loaf not
being quite as high as usual.

NOTES :
"Found!  A booklet of recipes by weight.  Where the recipes say bread
improver you'll probably just want to leave it out and use bread flour.  If
you want more of these recipes by weight, I'm happy to post some more.
Haven't tried the white but have tried the Wholemeal and it was good."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --1.5 pound loaf:
  1 1/4           cups  Water -- or milk
  1                     egg white -- optional
  2        tablespoons  Butter or margarine
  3 1/4           cups  Flour
  1           teaspoon  Salt
  2        tablespoons  Dry milk -- (if you used water)
  3        tablespoons  Honey -- (or a scant 1/4 C)
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast -- (1 tsp Instant Dry
                        Active yeast)

You can use Standard white setting, or Sweet (at least on my Regal).

	The first measurement, if you are going to use the egg white, put
it in the measuring cup first then measure your 1 1/4 C water or milk.

	One thing I have noticed is that the addition of the egg white
makes the bread very soft and it does not dry out very quickly. Starts
out very moist and stays that way.

Carefully remove and serve cake warm.

Note 1: for candied fruit haters, use instead some candied cherries or well
drained and chopped marachino cherries.
Note 2: these types of yeast recipes tend to stale quickly- best eaten
fresh! If not eaten in a  day or so  freeze uneaten portions .

NOTES : Here is another babka recipe; From my mothers files, and quite old.
Old but delicious nevertheless.

It requires a 9 inch turks head mold , 9 inch bundt or tube pan. the turks
head mold pan make this even more special in presentation. The turks pan can
be bought in kitchen or specialty bakeware stores.Another name for the turks
head pan is a Gugel or Kugelhopf pan ( fluted bundt pan so to speak )

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  12            ounces  beer -- at room temperature
  3               cups  self-rising flour

Heat oven to 350F.  In medium-size enamel pot over medium heat,
cook sugar until caramelized and light-brown in colour; remove
from heat.  Slowly pour in beer; liquid will foam and bubble.
Mix well with wooden spoon until all sugar is dissolved.  In
large bowl, combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt (if desired);
slowly pour in liquid.  Mix until ingredients are incorporated
and dough is smooth.  Place dough in 9-inch nonstick loaf pan.
Bake until toothpick inserted into bread comes out clean, about
1 hour.  Remove bread from oven and let cool on rack.  Makes one
loaf; 16 slices.

Per slice: 110 calories, 2g protein, 0g fat, 23g carbohydrate,

Notes:  In order to dissolve the sugar I had to keep the beer &
        sugar mixture over medium heat while stirring.  Let me
        know if you run into the same problem.  This bread was
        very flavorful.  Gold recommends that people experiment
        with various types of beer, stout and ale.

        BTW, this recipe by Rozanne Gold was printed in the
        September 1996 issue of Essence magazine.

NOTES : I found and modified a good recipe for sourdough bread.  **  The key for me is to use the machine to make the dough, and to rise and bake the stuff OUTSIDE of the machine, which I call the Invention Exchange with a nod to Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's a proofing box fashioned from a sytrofoam cooler.[Susan]

I picked up a recipe for Beer-Cheese Bread at my local Publix Supermarket
while shopping for bread making supplies.  The recipe, according to the
recipe card, is courtesy of Cooking Light Magazine.  The bread was a hit
with my family.  It went well with spaghetti and red wine.  Rather than
follow the recipe's procedure exactly, I used the dough cycle on Regal my
bread machine and got excellent results.

Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm beer in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.
Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour and next six ingredients to form a soft dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and
elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a
time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.  Divide dough in half, and
shape each portion into a 6-inch round loaf.  Place loaves 4 inches apart on
a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray.  Brush tops of dough with
egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Make 1/8-inch-deep cuts in a
lattice design across tops of loaves.  Let rise in a warm place (85'F), free
from drafts, 1 hour and 15 minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Bake at 375'F
for 15 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped.  Cool on wire racks.

Yield: Two loaves, eight servings each (about 119 calories per wedge).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           Cups  warm water
  1                  T  yeast
                        mix in:

  1                  T  salt
  4                  C  Flour -- Ww, Oat, White


Let yeast proof in water for 5 minutes, then mix in the honey, salt and flour.

Knead for 10 minutes until dough is happy

Rise, coverd in oiled bowl for 15 minutes

Pat dough into rectangular slab 1 " thick and cut into strips.  Join ends of
strips together to form bagels.  Let rise, covered, on oiled tray for 20
minutes

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and put a pot of water on to boil

After the 20 minute rise is done, drop bagels, one at a time, into boiling
water.  Take them out once they rise to the top of the water (Should be
anywhere between 30 sec and 1 minute)

While still wet, sprinkle on toppings of choice (onion, garlic, sesame seeds,
poppy seeds, and sea salt all at once is my favorite)  Bake on tray with
cornmeal to prevent sticking.
They will be done in around 25 minutes (varies) - when tops are golden brown.

can be made in 1 1/2 hours, start to finish.  This recipie has been
tried by friends who have never worked with yeast before with great success.

Allow them to cool a bit before slicing.  EnJOY!

  2               Cups  warm water
  3           Packages  active dry yeast
  4          Teaspoons  sugar
  3          Teaspoons  salt
  6               Cups  bread flour -- (6 to 6 1/2)
                        Flour for dusting (preferably rye flour -- For Added Flavor)
                        Oil -- for greasing bowl
                        Topping:
  3        Tablespoons  minced onion
  2          Teaspoons  poppy seeds -- (optional)
  1           Teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1              Pinch  salt

Combine topping ingredients and set aside.

In a large bowl sprinkle yeast over the warm water to soften; stir to
dissolve. Add the sugar, 6 cups of flour, and salt. Mix thoroughly
until dough forms up and comes away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn out the dough onto a floured worksurface and knead, adding small
amounts of flour as needed, for 10 to 12 minutes.

Shape the dough into a ball; place in a large oiled bowl and turn to
coat. Cover and allow to rise 30 minutes. Press out all of the air
with your fingers and allow to rise until doubled in size (20-30
minutes).

Punch down the dough, divide into thirds, roll out under your palms
into ropes, and cut each rope in 6 equal pieces. Roll into balls.
Cover and allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes.

Rollout each ball into a 3 1/2 inch circle. If the dough becomes too
stiff or shrinks back, allow it to rest and go on to the next piece.

Evenly space the circles on 2 floured or cornmeal dusted baking pans.
Cover with flour rubbed cloths and allow to rise until puffy. Make an
indentation from the center outward, leaving a 1-inch rim. A shot
glass with a 1" bottom also works well. Press with a circular motion.
Dribble bit of the reserved topping into the hole. Dust lightly with
reserved flour. Cover with cloths and allow to proof until puffed up.

Bake without steam in a preheated 450 deg F oven for 15-20 minutes.
Make 18 bialys.

 Categories: Breads, Starters
      Yield: 1 recipe

  Stir the yeast into the warm water and let stand until creamy looking,  about 10 minutes. Stir in the remaining water and then the flour, 1 cup at  a time.

  By Hand: Mix with a wooden spoon for 3 to 4 minutes.

  By Mixer: Mix with the paddle at the lowest speed for 2 minutes.

  By Processor: Mix just until a sticky dough is formed.

  Rising -
  Remove to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at a  cool room temperature for 6 to 24 hours. The starter will triple in volume  and still be wet and sticky when ready. Cover and refrigerate until ready
  to use. When needed, scoop out desired amount.

  Also, it's best to weigh the biga, (like in a small diet scale) rather  than trying to get it into a measuring cup, because amounts can vary.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  blue cheese
     1/3         pound  butter -- at room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  poppy seeds

  Preheat oven to 350F.  Crumble the cheese; add butter and cream to
   a smooth consistency.  Mix cayenne with flour; add to cheese mixture.
   Mix well.  Divide contents in half; wrap and chill for 1/2 hour.

   Roll each chilled ball of dough into a 1: thick cylinder.
   Roll each cylinder in the poppy seeds, coating them as desired.

   Cut cylinders into 1/4" slices.  (They will slice better if you
   pre-freeze them first for about 30 to 45 minutes.)  Lay on DRY
   baking sheets.  Bake 15 minutes or until a very light golden brown.
   Serve warm or at room temperature.

   This dough may be made ahead and stored in the freezer until
   needed.

   Makes 60 crackers (about a box).

                Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 Lb Loaf:
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  yeast
  1 3/4           Cups  bread flour -- PLUS 2 T
     1/2           Cup  rolled oats
  2        Tablespoons  wheat germ
  1         Tablespoon  vegetable oil
  3        Tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  3        Tablespoons  unsalted butter
     2/3           Cup  water
     3/4           Cup  blueberries


1. Add ingredients except the blueberries in the order suggested by your bread
   machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
   manufacturer's directions.

2. At the beeper (or at the end of the first kneading in the Panasonic or
   National), add the blueberries.

NOTES:  This loaf came out pretty soft.  I didn't think it was cooked fully,
        with the normal bake setting, but once I let it cool completely, it
        seemed to firm up a bit.

Enjoy!

                         Boboli Type Pizza Crust

                Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  water
  3               Cups  All-Purpose Flour
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  2        Tablespoons  olive oil
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
  2          Teaspoons  Active Dry Yeast -- Red Star Brand
  1           Teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          Teaspoons  parmesan cheese
     1/2      Teaspoon  Italian seasoning
                        parmesan cheese to sprinkle

Add all ingredients (except) second parmesan cheese  to breadmaker in
order listed by your manufacturer. It is a good idea to put the garlic
down inside the flour so it does not slow the yeast.  Set breadmaker on
dough setting.  When complete, form two crusts on pizza pans, sprinkle
with parmesan cheese, cover  and let rise  again.  Bake 5-10 minutes at
about 450 F  until light brown.  Cool.  Wrap tightly in foil and freeze
until you get the pizza urge.  Great to have around for easy last minute
dinners.  Good way for kids to make pizza too.

I am new but already enjoying this list.  Thanks.  Here is a pizza crust
I keep in the freezer.  Everyone thinks it tastes like a boboli.  Enjoy
  :-|)




                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : One of our favorite toppings is pizza sauce, Andoli sausage from
Costco, Artichoke hearts, dollops of pesto and grated mozarella cheese.
I micro the sausage so that it is not greasy when I put it on the pizza.
Dinner can be ready in minutes.

  2              large  eggs
     5/8           Cup  water -- tepid
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oil -- corn OR

     1/2           Tsp  salt

  3               Cups  bread flour
  2 1/4            Tsp  Yeast -- Rapid-Rise

 I have a Hibachi 1.5 lb machine and the specified order
for ingredients is wet then dry. When I am there, I add the
yeast about 30 sec. after it starts mixing. Otherwise just
put it on top of the dry ingredients. I  use the dough setting
and then braid and bake it by hand.

Add to machine in the manufacturers prefered order (Hitachi is wet
first, but dry first works fine in other machines). Select dough
mode. Remove when first rise is finished and punch down on a
floured surface (dough is slightly sticky and very puffy). After
resting for a few minutes, divide into
thirds, roll into ropes and braid. Let rise until almost doubled in
a warm place, about 45 minutes. I braid the loaf and place on a
slightly oiled cookie baking sheet to rise. Bake in a pre-heated 350 deg. F
oven for 25 minutes (approx). You can give it an egg wash,
but I find the loaves get nicely brown without it.

                               Recipe Conversion

This technique is for yeast breads only

Four steps:
  1. Cut the recipe down so it will make one loaf.
  2. Determine the parameters of your bread machine.
  3. Determine the liquidity ratio of the recipe.
  4. Determine the overall bulk of the recipe.

1. Reducing recipe size.
      Most recipes tell how many loaves they make.  Some will tell the size of
the loaf.  Cut the recipe down so it will make one loaf.
      A rough judgement can be made by looking at the flour required.  A 1
pound loaf requires about 2 cups of flour.  Therefore if your recipe calls for
6 cups of flour, you can figure it will make 3 - 1 pound loaves or 2 - 1 1/2
pound loaves.

2.  Determine machine parameters.
      Since each machine varies in its capacity and motor power, you must
determine the acceptable ranges for your machine in two categories: liquidity
ratio and bulk.  To find your machine's range, look at the basic white bread
recipe that came with the machine.  Determine the number of cups of flour
called for.  Follow that column until you find the row that shows the number
of ounces of liquid (water or milk) called for in the recipe.  In that box you
will find the ratio range for your machine.  Highlight or write down the ratio
range.

      Bulk is determined by the number of cups of flour called for in the
basic white bread recipe for your machine.  If the recipe calls for 2 to 2 1/2
cups of flour, you have a 1 pound machine.  If the recipe calls for 3 to 4
cups of flour you have a 1 1/2 pound (or greater) machine.

                        Bread Machine Liquidity Ratios

Ounces Liquid              Cups of Flour

                    2          2 1/2         3         3 1/2

      5           2.9-3.5     3.6-4.4     4.3-5.3     5.0-6.2
      6           2.4-3.0     3.0-3.6     3.6-4.4     4.2-5.2
      7           2.1-2.5     2.6-3.2     3.1-3.7     3.6-4.4
      8           1.8-2.2     2.3-2.8     2.7-3.3     3.2-3.9
      9           1.6-2.0     2.0-2.4     2.4-3.0     2.8-3.4
      10          1.4-1.8     1.8-2.2     2.2-2.6     2.5-3.1
      11          1.4-1.7     1.6-2.0     2.0-2.4     2.3-2.8

The ratio for my Zo is 2.89.  (3.25 cups flour / 1 1/8 cups water)

Ratio is computed by dividing dry ingredients by liquid.  Higher ratios
indicate stiffer dough.  Lower ratios indicate more liquid dough.

3.  Determining Liquidity Ratio.
      Using the following chart you now need to determine the liquidity ratio
of your recipe.  Fill in the ingredients and their amounts in the appropriate
columns.  Write the amounts as decimal fractions so you can use a calculator
later to add them up.  For example if the recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of flour
- - put 2.5 in the dry cup column.  You'll have to determine whether an
ingredient is dry or wet.  Generally - use the form the ingredient is in when
you add it.  Exeptions to this are things that are goin to melt when heat is
applied such as butter, margarine, fresh cheese  or shortening.
      Some ingredients shouldn't be computed.  Don't include the following in
the calculation: yeast, raisins / nuts / seeds added at the mix cycle.
      You should count raisins / nuts / or seeds added initially as dry
ingredients.

      After you have entered all the ingredients, total each column and place
the sum in the subtotal box.  Then multiply the subtotal by the multiplier
specified and place the result in the total box.  Add the totals together for
wet and dry grand totals.  Then divide the dry grand total by the wet grand
total to compute the ratio for this recipe.

      For best results the ratio should fall within the range specified for
your machine from step 2.  If the ratio only misses by a few points it will
probably be satifactory.  If the ratio is below the range your dough might be
too wet. Try a slight reduction in liquid ingredients or an increase in dry
ingredients and recalculate.  If the ratio is above the range, it is too dry.
Add liquid or reduce the dry ingredients.

      You may still need to experiment a little but this calculation will get
you beyond the trial and error stage.

4.  Determining Bulk.
      You don't want to overflow the machine so make sure that the recipe
doesn't call for more than 2 1/2 cups of flour for a one pound machine, or
more than 3 1/2 cups for a 1 1/2 pound machine.  If you need to fine tune the
recipe make equal adjustments to both the wet and dry ingredients in order to
maintain the liquidity ratio.

WHY THIS BOOKLET

Dear Fellow Breadmaker,

        Welcome to the wonderful world of bread baking using your
DAK AutoBakery!!

        Over the past year we've been collecting tips and suggestions
from fellow bread-making DAKonians (and coming up with a few of our
own from the DAK kitchen) and we'd like to pass a few of them on to
you. "Helpful Hints for DAK's AutoBakery from Customer Service" is
a compilation of those ideas. "Helps" include how to perform the self
test; what to do if the crust of your bread is too brown; cleaning
methods; what flour is best to use; and what to do if you live at a
high altitude.

        Again, DAK Breadmaker, thanks for your assistance and we look
forward to the opportunity to serve you in the future.

Happy baking!!

Your friends at DAK

                                1.

--------

HOW MUCH GLUTEN SHOULD I ADD?

        What is Gluten? Wheat gluten is the natural protein derived
from wheat. It is basically wheat flour with the starch removed. It
will promote higher rising, improved shape, enhanced flavor, increased
protein, and extended freshness. Gluten may be ordered from DAK
(#5320) for $1.89 ($0.50 P&H) [this is a 10 oz. box], or you may find
it at a local health food store.

        In most recipes, adding one tablespoon of gluten will assist
in the loaf rising, but isn't mandatory.

(SUGGESTION: If bread flour is unavailable, and all purpose flour is
used, we recommend adding one tablespoon of gluten to all recipes
except the oat bran recipes.)

                                2.

--------

WHAT'S THE BEST WATER TEMPERATURE TO USE?

        The ideal temperature for the water/liquid for use in the
recipe is 105 to 125 degrees F. As a guideline, the water should be
hot to the touch.

        What kind of liquid can I use? Very soft water will make a
soft, slicky dough that does not rise well. If your water is very
hard, you'll find that a tablespoon of cider vinegar or lemon juice
added to the water will make a better bread.

        Many liquids can be used in baking bread: water, milk,
fruit juice, soy milk, potato water, egg and others.

                                3.

--------

WHAT'S THE BEST FLOUR TO USE?

        Of the brands on the market, we have found the following
work quite well:

        Pillsbury(TM) Bread Flour
        Gold Medal(TM) - Better For Bread (Yellow Package)
        King Arthur(TM) (East Coast)

                                4.

--------

WHAT IF THE BREAD CRUST IS TOO BROWN

        We have found these options help keep the crust from be-
coming too brown:

        1) Reduce the amount of sugar by one to two tablespoons.

        2) Use honey in place of sugar, cutting the quantity in
           half.

        3) Use the sweet bread setting instead of the recommended
           setting.

        4) Use a sugar substitute and use the same recipe require-
           ments as for sugar. (This may seem strange to those who
           use sugar supplements in other ways. There will be no
           aftertaste when the sugar supplement is cooked. There-
           fore, a one to one ratio is used when using a sugar
           substitute.) [Note: be sure that the substitute can
           be heated/cooked; not all can.]

                                5.

--------

ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT

        Those DAKonians who live in a high altitude area (3500 to
6500 feet) may find it necessary to make some altitude adjustments
in procedure. According to the high altitude directions on the Gold
Medal Better For Bread Flour(TM) package, "Rising time may be
slightly shorter". General Mills recommends that you start with
the minimum amount of flour the recipe calls for. Different brands
of "high altitude flour" may be purchased to compensate for the
difference in altitude.

                                6.

--------

WHAT IF THE LOAVES RISE TOO HIGH?

        There are two ways to avoid this:

        1) Follow the recipe, measuring correctly.

        2) As the loaf rises, make a small hole in the loaf with
           a toothpick just before it goes into the baking cycle.
           (NOTE: Do not use a knife.)

        **To Make Cleanup easier: Coat the inside of the dome with
        Pam(TM) or other cooking spray.

                                7.

-------

WHAT IF THE MIDDLE OR TOP OF THE LOAF IS UNCOOKED OR UNDERDONE?

        If this occurs, the following steps will assure that the loaf
is completely cooked.

        Between the last stage of fermentation and the baking cycle use
a baking brush to brush the top of the loaf with one of the following:

        1) A beaten egg with one to two tablespoons of water, mixed
           into a fine glaze.

        2) Egg white, cream of tartar, and approximately one to two
           tablespoons of water mixed into a fine glaze.

        3) Melted butter.

        After brushing the top of the loaf and closing the lid, create
an aluminum foil "shield" to cover the outside of the dome.

                                8.

HELPFUL COOKING HINTS

        When choosing to substitute ingredients, results may vary.
A few attempts may be necessary to obtain a successful loaf. If you
try a recipe substitute and find it successful, we'd appreciate
hearing about it. Please write to:

                            Canoga Park, CA  91304

        Some recipes call for egg whites. We have found that gently
folding the egg whites into the recipe works much better than simply
adding them into the ingredients.

                                9.

--------

HOW TO CLEAN THE AUTOBAKERY

        When cleaning the Autobakery, we have found the following
to be the most effective:

        1) A mild soap and water solution

        2) A cleanser such as "409"

        3) A white vinegar and water solution. (A 3 to 1 ratio
        of water to vinegar works best.)

        Use a damp sponge or cloth, and NEVER "flood" the Breadmaker

with any of the above solutions.

        As you know, you can remove the red flexible seal at the
bottom of the well. A gentle tug is all it takes. When the seal is
out, use a toothpick to remove leftover ingredients from around
the motor shaft and seal area. This area should be clean to allow the
seal to be replaced.

                                10.

--------

SELF TEST

        If you experience problems that suggest your Breadmaker
could be faulty, the unit has a self test which will help you de-
termine what to do.

        When performing the self test, the most accurate results
are found when the unit has been cold for at least two hours.

        First, please remove the inner pot. This is done to save
the inner pot and will not affect the outcome of the test. Now,
please follow these steps:

        1) Unplug the breadmaker.

        2) Press the "CLOCK" button* and "CLEAR" button on the
           display area and place the plug into the electrical out-
           let while continuing to press the buttons.

                A display of "8:8" ("12:12" on some models)
        should show on the LED. If not, go through steps 1 and 2
        again until this display is shown.

        3) Press the "CLEAR" button again. You should now see a
           sequence of numbers begin to be displayed on the LED.
           These numbers merely mean that the machine is going through
           its test cycle... the numbers themselves aren't important
           to observe.

                                11.

--------

*NOTE: On some models there is no "CLOCK" button. Instead, press
"TIME OF DAY" Button.

        4) The test will take about 20 minutes. At the end of the
           test, you should see a display of "E123" (on some models)
           or "11:11" (on some models). Such display values indicate
           that the machine is functioning properly.

        If you receive a message on the LED screen reading "E55",
        please try the following procedure.

                Look into the upper left hand side of the baking
        unit. You will see four screws and a metal heating sensor
        located between the top two screws. Please take a 2 inch
        by 6 inch strip of aluminum foil and drape it over this
        sensor, allowing the lid to hold it in place. Then repeat
        steps one through four.

                If any values other that the ones listed in step
        four (4) appear on the display, this means the machine
        failed one of the test cycles and needs repair. Please
        contact DAK's Technical Department for assistance (Toll
        Free 1-800-888-9818).

        [I tried this self test on my machine and got "8:8" as
        the initial value and "11:11" as the final value. Be
        aware that the machine will heat up for a while and then
        turn on the fan. The test took about 10 minutes for my
        machine. The machine remains in the test mode after the
        self test--pressing "CLEAR" brought up the "8:8" display
        and pressing it again seemed to start the test all over.
        I cycled power to it and then reset the clock. As far as
        I know, this self-test is only for the original DAK Auto-
        Bakery; I don't know if it works with the Turbo version
        or with WelBilt machines.]

                                12.

References
- ----------
I am using a several sources of information:

"Berner Kochbuch", 1961. This is the cookbook every little
	girl and boy who took the cooking classes received in
	my school.

"Kleine Backschule Brot" by Betty Bossi. Betty Bossi is the
	Swiss housewife's steady companion with many cookbooks.
	This is just one of them.

Instructions on making bread from my best friend Ruth whose
father is a well-know baker in the region where I grew up.

My own humble experiences, including all the times when my bread
turned out wrong.

Measurements
- ------------

Since these are Swiss recipes, measurements are metric. Here are
approximate conversion tables. (If I have time, I'll include American
measurements. Myself, I got me a metric scale.)

1 l = 1 quart
1 dl = 1/10 of a quart or a little less than 1/2 cup
2.5 dl = 1 cup
20g is 4/5 of an ounce. 1 ounce is about 27 grams.
1 Swiss pound is 500 grams or 1.1 American pounds.
Celsius to Farenheit as a rule of thumb for cooking:
		Celsius * 2 + 30 = Farenheit.
	This is accurate enough for baking and does not require
	mathematical acrobatics.

Note, that especially with bread, most measurements are relative.
Play with the amounts until they work for you. When I want to make
quick bread, I measure about 2 pounds of flour, dump in some water,
salt, and the yeast, all by eye, and the result is usually just fine.

Temperature
- -----------

"Middle Heat" is about 400F;
"Low Heat" is about 250F; but you have to experiment. The terms
are intentionally fuzzy since different ovens bake differently,
and the good baker is supposed to find out by experience what works
for their kitchen.

Yeast and Baking Powder
- -----------------------

20 grams of fresh yeast is equivalent to 7 grams of dry yeast.
That is the average amount of yeast needed per 500g (5.1 pounds)
of flour. Amounts can vary, depending on whether you like your
bread yeasty, and how much time you have to let it raise. But
more on that later. I usually guess at about a teaspoon of dry
yeast per pound of flour. (In Europe you can buy yeast in little
7g packages, pre-measured. It is so common that most recipes ask
for n packages of dry yeast. I haven't seen that here.)

Sometimes, when I am really lazy, or when I want a bread that
tastes differently, I use baking powder instead of yeast.

If your bread comes out tasting too yeasty, use less yeast and
let raise longer. But more on yeast later.

Salt
- ----

Be generous. Most non-professionally made breads are bland, because
there is not enough salt in them. I have seen Ruth's father add
salt, and it is by the handfull, and the bread never turns out too
salty. Unless you are on a salt-restricted diet for medical reasons,
this is not the place to skimp on salt!

Salvaging and Trouble Shooting
- ------------------------------

Ruth just told me a few weeks ago that the most common cause for
bread to turn out too heavy is that the dough is TOO DRY! Make
sure the dough is is still somewhat sticky when you make the loafs.

If your bread turns out totally heavy, toast it dark to eat it.
Or use it in soup. Or put lots of jam on and eat it with your eyes
closed. Or bake it again. It won't raise, but it will dry out.
Or feed to your pets, they'll love it. Use it for stuffing.

Kneading, the Secret Ingredient
- -------------------------------

Kneading has two purposes: to thoroughly mix all the ingredients,
and to push air into the bread. When you are kneading, harass,
torture, and work that dough. Fold it over to trap air. For one
kilogram of flour (2.2 pounds), you should vigorously knead your
bread for 20 (twenty!) minutes. If you don't break out into a
sweat, you are not working hard enough. My friend Ruth says, it
is all in the kneading; that you should torture the poor bread
dough until you feel sorry for it and yourself.

Get your hands in there, and don't be afraid to get all full
of dough. It's therapeutical. :-)

I knead bread first in the large bowl, then take it out onto a
dry, clean surface. Sprinkle the surface and your hands with
flour whenever things get too sticky, but not too much, lest the
dough become too dry.

To find out how much air you have in your dough, cut it with a
knife and examine the the split. The more and the larger the
air bubbles you see, the better.

When is My Bread Baked ?
- ------------------------

I know of three ways of checking, whether your bread is ready:

	1) Baking time based on experience.
	2) Stick an needle in. If any dough sticks to the needle when
	   you pull it out, the bread is still wet inside. That is a
	   knittin needle. I believe some people use a straw here.
	3) Knock on the bottom of the bread. If it sounds really
	   hollow, then the bread is done. This is the best method,
	   but it takes some practice to find out what "hollow"
	   means.


... and Finally
- ---------------

Making bread depends on a lot of factors. Experiment with the
information you get until you find out what works for you.
Making bread is not a science. Bakers apprentice for 4 years
to get their certificate!

These instructions are not infallible. Use at your own risk.
And expect to eat a lot of almost good bread before finding
the perfect combination.

                            Bread Rising Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                  ****


The main reasons I found for lack of rise in my bread are, in order of
importance:

1) Ingredients are too cold: warm up the water in the microwave (or by
whatever    other means) first. Once I did that, the bread started rising
quite well.

2) Pre-knead the dough for 15 minutes. This makes a huge difference.
Just set the machine on the cycle you want and press start. After 15
minutes, press stop and then restart the cycle from the beginning.
If you want to make the bread on the timer, then just put all the
ingredients into the breadpan EXCEPT for 1 cup of flour and the
yeast. Let the machine knead the stuff in the breadpan for 15 minutes
and then press stop, and add the last cup of flour, add the yeast on
top, and set the timer.

3) Not enough liquids: there, one has to be careful. Not enough
liquid will prevent the bread from rising well, but too much
liquid will make it rise well, but then it will collapse. This
is especially true with Rye bread.  Too much liquid will make it
so that the insides of the bread will spill out when you removed
the bread at the end of the cycle.

4) You use gluten, so this might not matter. But just in case,
make sure your wheat flour is made from hard wheat. You should
not have to use gluten. For the rye bread, gluten should also
not be necessary, but if you really like fluffy bread, then
add it anyways.

                        -- chopped
  1                Cup  Feta Cheese
  3             Cloves  Garlic
     1/4           Cup  Italian parsley -- (flat leaf parsley
                   cup  Fresh Dill -- choppped

  1           teaspoon  rice -- optional
                        --or cracked wheat

To make the bread dough:  Put the dry yeast in a cup with 1/2 cup hot water
(just above body temperature, to your finger).  Stir in sugar and leave in a
warm undisturbed place to prove.
Mix the semolina flour, or unbleached bread flour with the whole wheat and
mixed-grain flours, adding the salt.  Pour onto a work surface, making a
hollow in the center.  When the yeast is frothy and doubled in bulk, pour it
into the center, with the olive oil, molasses, and 1 cup warm water.  Mix
together to make a cohesive dough, adding more water as needed.
Knead the dough, keeping the work surface, the hands and the dough floured,
until the dough is velvety and elastic - about 25 minutes.  Cover with a damp
cloth and leave to rise until almost double in bulk - about an hour.
Make the filling, so that it can cool before use.  Sauti the chopped onion in
the olive oil, adding little splashes of water if they stick.  When burnished
gold, sprinkle the onions with the sugar and cook until they caramelize.
 Assemble the greens and roast peppers, chopping them roughly.  Drain all the
cooked vegetables very thoroughly.  If necessary rinse the olives.  Make
herbed cheese by mixing the feta with the garlic, parsley, dill, and mint.
When the dough has risen, punch it down and divide into two slightly unequal
pieces.  Pat or roll each piece into a circle about 3/4-inch thick.  Place
the larger circle on an oiled or non-stick baking sheet.  Cover both halves
and leave to rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes
If the filling ingredients are moist, sprinkle the dough laid out on the
baking sheet with rice or cracked wheat.  Layer the fillings, in order of
preference, on the dough, leaving a border of 2-21/2 inches all around the
edge.  Lay the second circle gently over the filling.  Moisten the outer
edges of the bottom and roll them around and over the edges of the top.
 Press to seal.  Cut a few diagonal slits in the top for escaping steam and
leave the dough to rise until almost doubled in bulk - about 1 hour.  Bake in
an oven preheated to 350 degrees for 1 hours, or until there is a hollow
sound when the hot loaf is tapped on the bottom.

NOTES : *To roast peppers:  In a large shallow roasting pan, spread the
pepper slices so they are not more than 3-4 deep. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon
sugar, 4-6 tablespoons fruity olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste, and
mix these in.  In an oven preheated to 375 degrees, roast them uncovered for
1 or more hours until the edges of some of some turn brown and crunchy.
 After the first 30 minutes, stir frequently so they do not burn or stick to
the bottom.  Don't be surprised by the loss of volume.

*Grape must syrup is a honey-like syrup, and is used as a sweeFrom owner-br
was before the introduction of sugar.  This is called "petimezi" in Greek and
"vino cotto" in Italian and can be found in the respective groceries.

                        -- 8  Brioche Or Cake Cups


My 1 pound Panasonic ABM instruction manual has an excellent Brioche
recipe.  It's for the basic dough mode.

METHOD:
1) Make the dough according to instructions (for your particular machine).

2) Place the dough in a greased bowl.  Cover.  Rest the dough in the
refrigerator for 30 minutes.

3) Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.  Roll each portion into a
ball.  Cover with a plastic wrap and rest for 20 minutes.

4) Using the edge of the hand, pinch off about one-fourth of the dough
without detaching it.  Roll the dough on the bench so that both parts are
round.

5) Place the dough in the tin large-end first.  With fingertips, press the
small ball around its circumference into the large one.

6) Place tins on baking pan.  Spray water on top.  Proof at 90 degrees
Farenheit for 30 to 50 minutes or until the large ball rises above the tin.

7) Brush with beaten egg.

8) Bake in 350 degree Farenheit oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden
brown.


Brioche dough is very well suited to a bread machine because it's so oily
and sticky.  I've modified the recipe a little bit by spraying my dough
with Pam or other cooking spray instead of water for step #6, and then
covering it with plastic wrap for the rising process.  I also make it
into 12 individual round (not shaped) rolls, baked in oiled muffin tins,
instead of following the instructions to make 8 classic Brioche shapes
(knobbed on top).  These little rolls very rich and very tasty.

Yield 8

Makes 1 1/2 lb loaf.

Follow manufactures instructions for basic bread cycle
BUT: cut butter into tbs size pieces and begin adding butter 1 tbs each
minute 10 minutes before the end of the kneading cycle.This is done because
of the large porportion of butter needs to be adequately absorbed. Produces
a light, rich.,sweet loaf .Note: as with any bread machine recipe, you may
have to slightly adjust the flour and or water to get the right bread machine
consistency.

Dissolve yeast in milk with sugar till foamy.Blend in 2 beaten eggs and 3/4
cup flour to make a smooth mixture. Then blend in 2 more eggs, salt, melted
butter and 2 cups of flour. beat vigourously with wooden spoon until dough
is stiff and hard to stir. Let dough rest 5 minutes. Knead on floured
surface with heel of hands ( not warm palms ) until smooth and elastic.
Place dough in oiled bowl and cover and let rise in a warm place triple,
about 3 hours or let cool rise in refrigerator overnight. Pat dough into a
rectangle 12 inches long.Flip right side over to middle and left side over
to cover.Pat dough back into a rectangle and repeat the folding again ( this
redistributes the yeast cells to produce a fine grain texture ) Return dough
to bowl and let rise again a minimum of 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and
place in pan or pans and let rise slightly more than double. whatever pan
you use just fill 1/3 to 2/5 full. bake in a preheated 425 oven for 30
minutes or lightly browned. for coffeecake: roll out dough and cover with
sugar, cinnamon, nuts and reroll jelly roll style, forming into a ring and
cutting sections with a scissors and forming alternate pieces into a petal
design. Let rise double and bake in middle oven rack at 375 until lightly
brown. Yield: 1 brioche loaf or 2 , 12 inch coffeecake rings.
Note: the trick for perfect brioche dough is never let the temperature of
ingredients get to hot or to cold.
Since there are so many risings with this dough, I prefer to let the first
rise occur in the refrigerator.It really helps with the yeast cell buildup.
Enjoy!

*NOTE: The amount of water will vary according to the moistness of the
rice.

Basic Bread Setting

Process the ingredients according to your manufacturer's instructions for
a basic bread setting.  This recipe was developed using just-cooked rice.
If your rice has been sitting in the refrigerator overnight, you may need
an extra tablespoon or so of water.  If your machine has a light crust
setting, you might want to try it.

Remove the bread from the bread machine pan to a rack to cool.  Wrap to
store in aluminum foil or ina clean, brown paper bag.

This is WONDERFUL!!

This story and recipe is about as low a carbohydrate bread as can be made!
When I was in Pennsylvania in April, my son Bruce made a great
bread that had a light colored crunchy crust. He put the
ingredients into his Zoji S-15 and set it to the dough cycle. He
removed the dough at the end of the cycle, shaped it, slashed
the top and sprinkled a little flour over it. Then he set it to
rise until it had doubled in volume and baked it in a 450 degree
oven (with a pan of water on the bottom shelf) for 25 minutes.
The bread was light in color, had a good taste and an amazingly
crunchy crust. To add to the wonder of it, the bread has low
salt, no sugar and no fat (other than that which is part of the
flour). Contrary to our popular conception that yeast needs
sugar to feed on, it is capable of converting some of the
carbohydrate in the flour to its needs. Bruce was kind enough to
give me his recipe and I have worked on it to be able to get the
same results in the Zoji without having to turn on an oven
during the summer. I will give you the recipe both ways so you
can take your choice. He calls the loaf Peasant Bread. I call it
Bruce's Bread, in his honor.

The last two ingredients are necessary to get a light, high
rising loaf if baking is completed in the Zoji. The addition of these two
ingredients will allow baking the bread on the quick cycle! Reduce the
yeast to 1-1/2 tsp if you want to use the regular or delayed cycle.

The dough is quite soft. If you chose to bake it in the
oven, you may want to add a little flour to make it easier to handle.

Oven baking is 450 degrees for 25 minutes. A pan of water on the bottom
shelf will insure a crispy crust.

 HOW TO USE COMPRESSED YEAST:

  In using compressed yeast you may use double or even tripple the quantity
  of yeast given in your recipe in order to shorten time of fermentation.
  Be sure not to let your dough get too light at any stage of the procedure.

(In other words, don't let the dough go for too long a rise.  If you use
  this procedure and watch your dough texture/height, there is no reason
  why this should not work, and want the joy of doing it yourself.)

NOTES :
This is from the Fredericksburg Home Kitchen Cook Book,
first published in 1846.  I Have the Centennial Edition, 1946.  Great
find, a bit pricey, in the book stalls.  There are two yeast recipes,
followed by a Buttermilk Bread recipe.  These are old recipes, but my
grandmother made her own yeast on the farm and followed the same procedure
in Iowa, turn of the century.

Reminder, this recipe is an old one, and is therefore vague.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/8           Cups  buttermilk
  3        Tablespoons  honey
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  1         Tablespoon  butter -- or margarine
  3               Cups  bread flour
  2          Teaspoons  active dry yeast -- Red Star

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select Light Crust setting, and press Start.

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cook 1 hour before slicing.

I used 1T applesauce in lieu of the butter and reduced the buttermilk by 1T.

This is a very nice, tender, rich loaf. Great for sandwiches.

Next time I will try reducing the honey by 1T. [ECR}

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --1 Large Loaf: -- (small loaf:)
  1 3/4            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- (1 1/4 t)
  2 1/4              C  Bread Flour -- (1 1/2 C)
  1                  C  Rye Flour -- PLUS
  2               Tbsp  Rye Flour -- (3/4 C)
  1 1/2           Tbsp  Brown Sugar -- (1 T)
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt -- (1/2 t)
  1 1/2           Tbsp  Vegetable Oil -- (1 T)
  1 1/2           tbsp  Caramel Coloring -- (1T)
     1/3             C  Buttermilk -- (1/4 C)
  1                  C  Water -- PLUS
  2               tbsp  Water -- (3/4 C)

This nutritious black bread is perfect with hearty soups, with soft mild
cheeses from ricotta to brie, and with smoked ham or turkey.  Plain lowfat
yogurt can be substituted for the buttermilk.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.

Doesn't taste too much like pumpernickel but more like buttermilk.  Does
taste good.

NOTES :
I agree w/Reggie....tastes more like a very light wheat bread than pumpernickel, but still very good!

I omitted 1 1/2T caramel coloring. The bread rose too high.Try using 1-2T less water. Good taste, good texture, good sandwich bread. Not too sweet! [ECR]

I've found this could work well as mixes. I'll
be packaging the dry ingredients in zip-lock bags, labeling with instructions
to add water, oil/butter/ and yeast, and giving them as gifts to friends and
relative who own bread machines.

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     yeast cake
  1               pint  warm water
  1               tbsp  cornmeal
  1               tbsp  sugar
  1                tsp  salt
  1               pint  buttermilk
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  water

  Dissolve 1 yeast cake in 1 pint warm water, add 1 tablespoon each of
  cornmeal and sugar and 1 teaspoon salt.  Let stand over night.

  In the morning boil 1 pint buttermilk; have ready 1 cup flour and water,
  mixed to a smooth, stiff batter; pour this into boiling milk and let it
  cook thoroughly, stirring constantly.  When cool, add to the yeast mixture
  and set in a warm place until it ferments.  Then work in corn meal enough
  to make a stiff dough, mold into cakes and dry in shade.

HOW TO USE COMPRESSED YEAST:

  In using compressed yeast you may use double or even tripple the quantity
  of yeast given in your recipe in order to shorten time of fermentation.
  Be sure not to let your dough get too light at any stage of the procedure.

(In other words, don't let the dough go for too long a rise.  If you use
  this procedure and watch your dough texture/height, there is no reason
  why this should not work, and want the joy of doing it yourself.)

NOTES : This is from the Fredericksburg Home Kitchen Cook Book,
first published in 1846.  I Have the Centennial Edition, 1946.  Great
find, a bit pricey, in the book stalls.  There are two yeast recipes,
followed by a Buttermilk Bread recipe.  These are old recipes, but my
grandmother made her own yeast on the farm and followed the same procedure
in Iowa, turn of the century.

NOTES : Rebecca O'Dea created this recipe.  She says it reminds her of the
local deli Hawaiian Bread.  The bread is a high riser, is light and
fluffy with a crisp crust.  The variations are endless--i.e. devils
food, white, strawberry, raspberry.  Duncan Hines has a Key Lime mix.
All the sugar and salt needed are already in the cake mix.

  2           packages  active dry yeast

(original ingredients for 2 loaves)

Most of the ingredients were divided in half, but I used slightly less than
half the amount of water so that I would not exceed the maximum of 3 cups
of flour for my bread machine. (This also has the effect of intensifying
the cheese flavor.)  I also used slightly less than half the amount of
yeast, because this bread rises very high and will overflow the pan if I
don't use LEVEL teaspoons of yeast.  The amount of salt was reduced
slightly below half due to personal taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter -- or veg. shortening
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour
     3/4          cups  rye flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  dry milk
  1         tablespoon  caraway seed
  2         tablespoon  wheat gluten
  2 1/2      teaspoons  dry yeast

One of the problems with bread machines is that the density of
whole grain or rye breads can approach that of neutron star
material. So after experimenting with a number of variable I have
a never-fail lighter, aromatic rye bread recipe that is great for
slicing and sandwich making. I use a Hitachi HB-B201+ bread
machine. [Michael]

After the dough has kneaded for about 5 min I make sure that its
composition is a solid twirling ball. If the dough looks overly
sticky or is smearing around in the bread pan I add bread flour
in 1 tablespoon amounts until the dough firms up. This will
prevent the collapse of the center of the loaf during the second
rise.  The bread machine is set to the "bread" menu
and the bread color setting is set to medium.

                        Care And Storage Of Yeast

Recipe By     :SAF Yeast; Irwin Frankel

Categories    : Bread Mailing List              Bread-Bakers Mailing List

                  ****

Yeast is a delicate, single celled organism that makes it easy to produce
raised bread.
Yeasts work well when they are in a temperature range of 85 to 115 degrees
F, depending upon the variety. Rapid rise yeasts prefer the higher
temperatures. There is a simple procedure called "Proofing" which is a way
to test whether yeast is good.*
Yeasts digest sugar and produce alcohol and carbon dioxide gas (CO2). These
are both natural products of the fermentation process. The alcohol
contributes to the taste of bread and the carbon dioxide produces bubbles
in the dough that make it expand and rise. All recipes are designed to
balance the ingredients so that the desired character of the loaf is produced.
In the unopened package, SAF Yeast has a shelf life of two years at room
temperature. We have yeast that works perfectly after four years when cared
for as described below.
Yeast is damaged by water and moistue. The following procedures are
designed to keep yeast dry.
 1. Select two air tight jars, one about four ounces and the other, one quart.
 2. Be sure the jars are absolutely dry!
 3. In a dry location, open the package of yeast and fill the small jar for
storage in the refrigerator for frequent use.
 4. Pour the remainder of the yeast into the large jar for storage in the freezer.
 5. To use yeast from the refrigerator jar: open the jar, pour out the
required amount of yeast, cover the jar and return it to the refrigerator
as quickly as possible. Avoid dipping measuring spoons into the yeast; they
may carry moisture.
 6. To refill the refrigerator jar: remove the freezer jar and allow it to
come to room temperature before opening. Notice that moisture will condense
on the outside of the container. (If the jar were opened when it was
frozen, moisture would condense into the yeast.) Dry the jar thoroughly.
Open it when at room temperature and pour some yeast into the refrigerator
jar. Tightly close both containers and return them to their storage locations.
How to Use SAF Instant French Yeast
   SAF Instant Yeast is a quality, high performance yeast, developed by the
world's largest and oldest yeast manufacturer, S. I. Lesaffre, in France.
 To bake bread in Automatic Bread Machines on the regular cycle or in
ovens: Use 1/2 teaspoon SAF Instant Yeast per cup of flour.
 To bake bread in Automatic Bread Machines on the quick cycle:
 Use 3/4 teaspoon SAF Instant Yeast per cup of flour.
 Adjust amount used to your taste.

* To proof yeast: Stir 1 tsp sugar into 1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115
degrees F.). Sprinkle 1 tsp yeast on the surface stir. In five minutes,
mixture should foam. In 10 minutes there should be a fairly thick layer of foam.

This moist multi-grain bread is excellent.  It is chock full of vitamins
and fiber and tastes good with fruit or vegetable salad or lentil or bean
soup.

Note:  The original recipe called for 3 T vegetable oil for the large loaf
and 2 T for the smaller loaf.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.   Let the loaf cool before slicing.

This is really good!

Put all ingredients in bread pan in the order listed.  Use Basic Wheat Cycle,

I don't have a juicer and didn't have any carrot juice handy so I substituted
1/2 applesauce and 1/2 water for the carrot juice.  I also used bread flour
instead of unbleached all- purpose flour, but I reduced the gluten flour by
about a quarter.  This bread is sweet and it came out very moist and light.

one large loaf or two small

Mix warm water with sugar and yeast.  Let sit 5-10 minutes or until foamy.
Add salt, oil, egg, and honey, then beat.  Add (one cup at a time) flour,
when pliable (usually about 3- 3.5 cups of flour added), turn onto a
lightly floured surface and knead, while adding more flour (as necessary).
Knead no less than 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and set in warm
place until double in bulk (usually 30-45 minutes).  Punch down dough, and
return, covered to warm place until double in bulk.  Punch down, and
divide into three or four pieces (I think its prettier with four), and
roll the pieces into long "snakes."  Braid the "snakes" and cover and
place in warm place until double in bulk (once again 30-45 minutes).
Place in pre-warmed oven - 325F / 165C, and bake 25-30 minutes or until
bottom sounds "hallow."

This is the challah recipe I use every week, and I have never tasted one I
prefer.  It usually takes me around three hours from start to finish to
make, and is worth every minute of it.

half to make 2 loaves.)

For each loaf, divide dough into 2 pieces, one about 2/3 of the dough
and the other about 1/3 of the dough. Divide larger piece into 3 equal
pieces; roll into 12 inch ropes. Place ropes on greased baking sheet. Braid

under new center rope; lay it down. Repeat to end. Pinch ends to seal.
Divide remaining pieces into 3 equal pieces. Roll into 10 inch ropes; braid.
Place small braid on top of large braid. Pinch ends firmly to seal and to
secure to large braid.

Cover; let rise in warm, draft free place until almost doubled in size,
15 to 20 minutes. Lightly beat egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water; brush
over braids. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until done,
covering with foil after 15 minutes to prevent excess browning. (For
even browning when baking 2 loaves, switch positions of sheets halfway
through baking. Remove from sheet (s); cool on wire rack.

AH.STEIN [Alan]

 Here's my challah recipe, which is a variation of one found in the Jewish
 Catalog.  This is the winter version, when the temperature in my home
 gets down to 55-60 overnight.  Times will vary at other seasons.

 This recipe makes four loaves.

 About 6pm, add three pkg yeast to two cups of lukewarm water.  Mix in three
 cups of flour and one cup of sugar and stir with a fork.  Let sit until it
 roughly doubles in bulk.  (The original recipe said a half hour.  I usually
 wind up waiting an hour or two.)

 Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix together five cups of flour, a half cup
 of sugar and 1 1/2 tsp of salt.  (You may wish to use less salt, especially
 if you use salted margarine.)  Blend in two sticks of margarine, using a
 pastry blender or knife or fork.

 When the yeast mixture has doubled, mix four eggs into it.  Then blend it
 together with the flour and margarine mixture and knead, adding flour as
 necessary.  (I usually wind up adding another two cups or so while
 kneading.)  If you're in the mood, you may want to mix in a cup or so of
 raisins, especially if it's for Rosh Hashanah.  Put in a greased bowl,
 greasing the top of the dough as well, put into a draft-free spot (I
 generally use the oven), wash your hands and log onto GEnie, and wait for
 it to double in size.

 When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and separate into four
 roughly equal size parts.  Then divide each part into three or four pieces
 and braid into gorgeous loaves, placing them onto greased cookie sheets.
 (I generally fit two to a sheet.)

 Now, get a good, but short, night's sleep.  (I usually get to sleep about
 11:30 while baking challah, and wake up about 6:00.  In the summer, it's a
 whole different ballgame and I sometimes put the loaves in the refrigerator
 overnight.)

 When you wake up in the morning, the loaves should have risen nicely.  If
 they haven't, be flexible and give them more time.  If they've risen too
 much, they'll look funny but should taste okay--but not great--anyway.

 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

 Mix together a little water and an egg and spread it on the loaves with a
 pastry brush.  (The Jewish Catalog recipe just says egg, but I sometimes
 ran out of egg before I finished so I started adding a little bit of water
 to extend it.)  Sprinkle with poppy seeds.

 Bake until they're done.  For me, the median time seems to be about 35
 minutes, although they've gotten done in as little as 25 minutes (last week
 when I was visiting a friend in the hot and humid Virgin Islands) or as
 much as 50 minutes.  You can tell they're done when you tap the bottom of a
 loaf and it sounds hollow.

 Add slighly beaten eggs to the sponge and stir in remaining liquid

* Saffron is an herb used in baking to lend a yellow color and fragrance.
 It is closely associated with the fragrant spices of the "Psumim" or
 Spice Box used on Sabbath and holidays.  It can be purchased in any food
 shop or drug store.

  2 1/2              C  whole wheat flour

  1                  T  salt
  1                  C  Water -- Lukewarm


Put 2 cups flour into a large mixing bowl.

Cut butter into small pieces.  Make a hollow in the center of the flour and add butter.  Rub butter into flour with your
fingertips until mixture looks like large bread crumbs.

Mix salt into water.  Add enough water, a little at a time, to flour mixture to make a firm (but not stiff) dough.

Knead dough in bowl for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour.

Divide dough into 1-1/2 inch pieces, and roll each piece into a smooth ball.

Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup flour onto a flat surface.  With a rolling pin, roll out each ball until it resembles a thin pancake.  [Try not to incorporate too much extra flour into the chapati - it makes them tough.]

Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.  Place one chapati in the center.  When small brown spots appear and the edges begin to curl up (in about 1 minute), turn the chapati over with a spatula.  Cook chapati for about 2 minutes or until small brown spots appear.  Wrap the cooked chapati in a towel to keep them warm.

Makes 12 to 15 chapati.

Note:  Butter may be omitted, or the amount of butter may be reduced.

As far as cheese bread goes, I've found that the best method is to
make an egg bread (I use the recipe in the DAK booklet), and then
cube about a cup of cheese (cheddar, muenster, provolone, whatever).
Add _half_ of the cheese when you start the machine, and when it beeps
a few minutes before the end of the kneading cycle, add the other
half of the cheese. That way you actually get some cheesiness noticeable
in the bread, rather than just a nice loaf of heavy bread that tastes
like cheese. It's best warm or toasted, and we often chomp an entire
loaf quickly just as it comes out of the breadmaker.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast -- activated in:
  1                cup  warm water
                        Into The Breadmaker Put:
  2 3/4              C  Flour
     1/4             C  Cornmeal
     1/4             C  Oil -- peanut or canola
  2               Tbsp  Olive Oil

The most difficult part of pizza construction is making the dough.
Now that we have a bread maker (DAK) I decided to see if the dough
could be made in the bread maker.  Verdict: It works great!

Makes two 10-inch deep-dish pizzas.

 Add the water/yeast mixture.

  Start the bread maker in Manual/White Bread mode.

 When the bread maker completes the fermentation and turns off,
  punch down the dough and let it rise a second time.
  Total time is approximately 4 hours.

 Divide the dough into two equal parts.  Spread the dough in two 10-inch
  cake pans and up the sides.  Cover the dough with slices of mozzarella
  cheese.  DO NOT USE GRATED CHEESE!  The cheese slices will melt into the
  dough when the pizza is baked and will provide a barrier from the
  toppings so that the crust will not get soggy.  Drain two 28 oz. cans
 of Italian Style whole peeled pear tomatoes (we used Progresso) into
 a strainer or colander.  Remove the ends of the tomaotes with a knife.
  Squish with fingers or chop the tomatoes with a knife into smaller
   pieces and drain off all of the juices.  Be careful - they squirt.
 Be sure to press out all of the juices or else your pizza will get soggy.
  Place the tomatoes on top of the mozzarella.  Add salt, chopped garlic,
  basil and oregano.  Top your pizzas with any of the following:
 salami, green pepper, onions, sausage, pepperoni, olives, mushrooms,       etc....  Dust the top the pizza with fresh grated parmesean or
  romano cheese.
   Bake for 35-40 minutes at 375F.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Green or Red Chile Puree -- (directions follow)
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (about 110 deg. F)
     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (4 1/2 to 5)

Preparation time:  30-45 min., plus 2-1/2 hours for dough to rise
     Baking time:  About 40 min.
     Storage time:  Up to 1 day at room temperature; up to 1 month in
     freezer

 Prepare chile puree of your choice and set aside.

     In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand for
     about 5 min. to soften.  Meanwhile, in a 2- to 4-cup pan, heat
     milk and butter to 110 degrees F.  Add to yeast along with salt,
     sugar, chile puree, and 2 c. of the flour, stirring to blend
     well.

     Stir in 1-1/2 c. more flour until moistened, then beat vigorously
     until dough forms long, stretchy strands (about 10 min.).  With a
     dough hook, knead in 1 to 1-1/2 c. more flour (or knead it in by
     hand on a floured board).

     Place dough in a greased bowl and turn to grease top.  Cover with
     plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled (about
     1-1/2 hours).

     Punch dough down and knead briefly on a floured board to release
     air.  Shape into a smooth loaf and place in a greased 5- by
     9-inch loaf pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm
     place until dough has risen 1-1/2 inches above pan rim (about 1
     hour).

     Bake in a 375 degree oven until golden brown (about 40 min.).
     Turnout onto a rack and let cool completely.  Wrap airtight;
     store at room  temperature for up to 1 day, in a freezer for up
     to 1 month.  Makes 1 loaf.

     Green Chile Puree:  In a blender or food processor, whirl 1 can
     (7 oz.) diced green chiles just until smooth.  You should have
     3/4 c.  For hotter flavor, add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. ground red pepper.

     Red Chile Puree:  In a 1-1//2- to 2-quart pan, combine 2 oz.
     (about 6 large) dried red New Mexico or California chiles (stems
     and seeds removed) with 1-1/2 c. water.  Cover and simmer until
     chiles are very soft (about 15 min.).  In a blender or food
     processor, whirl chiles with 1 to 2 tb. of the cooking liquid
     until pureed (add more liquid if necessary).  You should have
     about 1/2 c. puree.  For hotter flavor, stir in 1 tb. crushed
     dried hot red chiles.

  1                  T  Bean Paste -- Sweet


Here is an approximate recipe.

I have made them (and bbq pork pastries, etc) by using a regular white
bread recipe, and letting it rise once. Then, I roll out small balls of it
until they are about 6" wide (about 1/4" or less thick). Using sweet bean
paste (made from soy beans and purchased at a chinese grocery) I  put a
tablespoon or so of the paste in middle. Gather up all the edges to the
middle and twist closed. Set onto a steamer rack twisted side up.

Steam till done (gosh, can I remember how long that is?? i am guess from
memory, so don't take me at my word)...maybe about 15 minutes? perhaps 20.

Hope this helps more than confuses!

  2        tablespoons  sugar

  4                     chipotle peppers -- canned, pureed
                        Shortening -- * Pam


1.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and prehead two 6-inch cast
    iron skillets in the oven for 20 minutes.
        * I used 1 8-inch round pie pan

2.  In a mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt
    and baking powder.  Fold in the egg, buttermilk, milk,
    butter, and pureed chipotles

3.  Brush the preheated pans with shortening and immediately
    pour in the batter, approximately three-fourths of the way
    up.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cornbread is brown
    around the edges and firm.  Cut each cornbread into 4
    wedges.

Note:  So, here is the original recipe.  The changes I made are marked by
*, basically I adapted it so that it would be fat free.  It tasted
great!  I have no idea how it compares to the original recipe as
I didn't try it, but if anyone tries both, I would love to hear
how they compare.

Hope you enjoy this as much as I did!

   milk                                       1 1/4 cups
   bread or all purpose flour        3/4 cup
   active dry yeast                    1 1/2 tsp
   bread or all purpose flour        2 1/4 cups
   sugar                                    1/4 cup
   unsweetened cocoa                1/2 cup
   grated orange zest                2 TBS
   salt                                      3/4 tsp
   vanilla extract                   3/4 tsp
   unsalted butter                    6 TBS
   egg yolks                             4
   golden raisins                    3/4 cup
     or substitute fine chop nuts
   cinnamon                          3/4 tsp
   brown sugar                      1 1/2 tsp

  Bring milk to a boil.  Stir in first flour measurement.  Cook
  over medium heat until mixture resembles mashed potatoes, stirring
  constantly.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.

  Add all ingredients except the last three, according to manufacturer's
  instructions.  Process on normal bread cycle.

  At last beep at end of last mixing beep, or at end of first kneading
  cycle, add raisins/or nuts, cinnamon and brown sugar.

  Cool for at least 30 minutes IN machine.  This firms the bread.

  For a more traditional Babka, omit cocoa powder, orange zest.
  Add grated lemon zest              1 TBS            1 1/2 TBS
  Use raisins (no nuts)

  This is pretty with a light chocolate or white glaze on top.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  2               Pkg.  active dry yeast
     1/2           Cup  warm water -- (105-115 deg.)
     1/3           Cup  sugar
     2/3           Cup  warm milk
     1/2           Tsp  salt

  3               Tbsp  butter -- softened
  4 1/2           Cups  flour -- to 5 C
  3                     eggs
  3               Tbsp  butter -- melted
  1                Cup  walnuts
                        Filling:
     1/3           Cup  unsweetened cocoa
     2/3           Cup  sugar
                        Streusel Topping:
  2               Tbsp  butter -- softened
     1/4           Tsp  ground cinnamon
     1/3           Cup  Confectioner's Sugar
     1/4           Cup  flour

This isn't ABM-specific, but it's a good recipe.  I'm sorry I don't have
exactly what you are looking for, but I hope you enjoy it.

Streusel Topping:
Combine butter & cinnamon until smooth.  Add sugar & blend.
Add flour and mix until crumbly.

Filling:
Blend cocoa & sugar until there are no lumps.

Dough:
Sprinkle yeast over warm water, add 1 tsp sugar.  Let stand 5 minutes.
Add sugar, milk, salt, vanilla, and butter.  Add 2-1/2 cups flour and
mix to blend.  Beat on medium until smooth and elastic (about 5 min.).

Separate 1 egg and save white for the glaze.  Beat yolk and whole eggs
one at a time into mixture.  Add 1-1/2 cups more flour.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured board or cloth.  Knead 10-15 min.
until small bubbles appear in dough.  Continue adding small amounts
of flour as is necessary.

Turn dough into greased bowl and cover.  Let rise until doubled,
about 30-45 minutes.

Punch down dough and invert bowl over dough.  Let rest 10 minutes.
Divide dough in half and roll out into 2 10x20" rectangles.  Brush
1/2 of melted butter over each rectangle, leaving 1/2" margin around
all edges.  Sprinkle 1/2 of cocoa mixture over each, then sprinkle
nuts 1/2 over each.

Beginning with long sides, roll jellyroll fashion and pinch to seal.
Place zig-zag to fit in 4-1/2 x 8-1/2" loaf pans.  Let rise to doubled
about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350.  Beat egg white with 1 tsp water.  Brush dough
with glaze and sprinkle topping over dough.

Bake 30-35 minutes.  Carefully remove from pans and let cool on rack.

Measure carefully, placing all ingred in bread machine pan in the order
recommended by the manufacturer.  Select sweet cycle, do not use delay.  Add
chips and walnuts at beep in knead cycle.
Notes:  I had to add a bit of water during the kneading, but I didn't really
measure it and you guys may wish to keep an eye on it and adjust it for
yourselves, plus the original recipe used only 1 tsp yeast, which likely is
fine but I didn't try it that way.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  sourdough starter
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
     3/4           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  salt
  6               cups  flour -- (to 8 c), unbleached


Dissolve the yeast in the starter and water. Let sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a
chance to get going.

Add the milk, olive oil and salt. Stir in the flour, adding a cup at a time until you
have a dough the consistency of drop-cookie batter. Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured counter and knead it 10 to 15 minutes, adding more flour as needed until you
have a dough that is smooth and satiny. The dough should be on the slack side but not
oozy; it needs to be able to hold its shape in the oven.

Place dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place bowl in
a warm spot and let it rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Punch down dough to expel air bubbles and turn it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead
dough gently and divide it into three pieces. Form the loaves into torpedo shapes and
place on parchment-lined baking sheets. Slash tops of loaves and cover them with a damp
towel.
Let loaves rise until they look swollen, about 30 minutes. While loaves are rising,
preheat oven to 425 F.

Brush or spray loaves with water. Bake for 10 minutes, brushing or spraying the loaves
with water two more times. Turn the oven to 375 F and bake for 25 more minutes.

                International Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 3/4           cups  white flour -- bread
  2                     cakes compressed fresh yeast -- (0.6 oz each)
  1 3/4           cups  cold water -- (from the tap)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- or flaked sea salt
                        --
  2                     baking sheets -- heavily floured

Put 3,1/4 cups of the flour into a large bowl.  Make a well in the center
of the flour. Crumble the fresh yeast into a small bowl.  Stir in 1/2 c.
of the water until smooth.  Pour the yeast mixture into the well in the
flour.  Then add the remaining water to the well and mix.  Mix the flour
from the bowl into the yeast mixture in the well with your hand or a
wooden spoon to make a very sticky batterlike dough.  Using your hand,
beat the mixture for 5 minutes until very elastic.  Cover the bowl with a
damp dish towel and let rise at room temperature, away from drafts, for 4
hours until it rises and collapses.  The dough will rise up enormously,
so check that it does not stick to the dish towel. Punch down the dough.
 Add the oil and salt to the dough and mix briefly with your hand.  Then
gradually work the rest of the flour in the bowl into the dough with your
hand to make a soft, quite sticky dough.  When all the dough is smooth
and the flour has been thoroughly combined, cover the bowl with a damp
dish towel and let rise at room temperature, away from drafts, until
doubled in size, about 1 hour.
  Using a very sharp knife, divide the dough in half, disturbing the
dough as little as possible.  Do not punch it down or try to knead or
shape the dough at all.  Tip a portion of the dough onto each prepared
baking sheet, nudging it with a spatula, to form 2 rough-looking
rectangular loaves, about 1 inch thick.  Sprinkle the loaves with flour
and let rise, uncovered at rm. temp., away from drafts, until doubled in
size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  During the last 15 min. of rising, heat the
oven to 425F.
  Bake the loaves for about 35 min., or until they are browned and sound
hollow when tapped underneath.  Transfer the loaves to wire racks until
lukewarm, and then serve.  Or, eat within 24 hours, gently warmed.
Freeze for up to one week only.

"This new Italian loaf, all the rage in London, comes from the area
around Lake Como in the north, and it is supposed to resemble a slipper.
 In any case, it is free-form- simply poured out of the bowl in which it
has risen onto the baking sheet in a rough and ready rectangular loaf.
It has large holes, and a soft, but chewy, floury crust.  I find that
many commercial loaves taste of stale olive oil or lack the pungency of
good extra-virgin oil.
  Finding a good recipe for this bread was difficult, and I made abut 30
before I was happy with the results.  Taking advice from chef Pierre
Koffmann, I adapted his baguette recipe...adding a good quantity of olive
oil to the dough, and altering the final consistency.  As with the
baguettes, it is not easy to achieve a perfect result the first time,
even though the final loaf should taste very good.  I have not had good
results whth easy-blend yeast or dried yeast granules, so I have only
included instructions for using fresh yeast."

*NOTE (see below), made 12 hrs before

By coincidence, my sister just gave me a recipe for ciabatta, a
slipper-shaped bread from Lake Como, which she recommended highly.  It's
from an Italian cookbook, the name of which I didn't copy down.  I made it
last week, and it was very good, but it takes a long time to make!:

Stir yeast into milk; let stand until creamy, about ten min.  Add water, oil
and biga, mix until blended.  Mix flour and salt, add to the bowl, mix for 2
or 3 min.  Knead.  Let rise until doubled.  Cut dough into 4 pieces.  Roll
each piece into a cylinder, then shape into a rectangle, about 10x4 inches.
Place on floured baking sheets.  Dimple with knuckles so they won't rise too
much -- dough will look heavily pockmarked.  Cover with dampened towels, let
rise 1 1/2 - 2 hours, till puffy but not doubled -- the loaves will look
flat, but will rise in the oven.  Heat oven to 425 F, sprinkle loaves with
cornmeal.  Bake 20-25 min., spraying 3 times with water in the first 10
minutes. Cool on racks.


Biga starter for Ciabatta:
Stir yeast into warm water, let stand 10 min.  Stir in remaining water and
flour.  Mix for 3 or 4 minutes.  Let rise at cool room temp 6-24 hours --
the starter will triple in volume and be wet and sticky.  Refrigerate until
ready to use.  It freezes well, needs 3 hours at room temperature to
re-activate.  Can be refrigerated for about a week.

makes about 2 1/3 cups

Can't make  this Ciabatta in anything else because the dough is so wet. [Lora]

Mix together the ingredients and let them rest overnight in a covered bowl at
room temp

Make this very wet dough in the bread machine.  It should be between a batter
and a runny dough.Shape into 2 ciabatta - long, rough ovals about 4 x 10
inches.  Form on oiled baking sheet.   Let rise till light and bubbly, using
your fingers to poke indentations in the dough all over about 1/2 way through
the rising period.  Bake in a preheated 450 oven spraying with water once or
twice during baking (or add ice cubes to bottom of oven).  Bake 25 minutes,
then cool in turned off oven with door cracked open.  Dust with flour.

  2 1/4           cups  flour
  1                tsp  salt
  2        tablespoons  Brown Sugar
  2        tablespoons  Butter
  1         tablespoon  Dry Milk -- Optional
  1           teaspoon  Cinnamon
  1                Cup  water -- or milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        Filling:
  1                     Apple -- peeled, cored, and
                        chopped into 1/4" dice
  3        tablespoons  Brown Sugar
  1           teaspoon  Cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  Flour
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- optional

You can go one of two ways here:  Either use the "Dough" setting, and
roll up the dough with the filling, then bake in a conventional
manner, or add some chopped apple at the beep.  The first way looks
better, the second way is easier.

Filling:
Mix all the dry stuff together, then toss over the chopped apple.  Roll
out the dough into a rectangle, then spread the mixture evenly over the
rectangle.  Roll the dough along the short edge, like a jelly roll.

Place in a greased loaf pan, let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes,
then bake in a 350F degree oven for about 40 minutes, until the loaf
is nice and brown, and sounds hollow when tapped.

Let cool on a rack, devour.

  1 1/4              C  milk

  2 1/2            Tsp  yeast
     1/2             C  chopped walnuts
     1/2             C  sugar
  1 1/2           Tbsp  cinnamon

     Put first seven items in bread machine, set on dough.
     Generously grease the bottom, middle and sides of a standard-sized tube or bundt pan. (A ten inch round pan with high sides will work.)  Sprinkle some of the cinnamon/sugar/nut mixture on bottom and sides.
     When the dough is kneaded and has risen (2 hrs.) remove and roll into a large oval, about 9-10 inces wide and 16-17 inhes long. Sprinkle with the rest of the cinnamon/sugar/nut mixture, leaving a 1/2inch rim around the outer edge. Roll the dough up tightly along the long edge, pinching the edges to seal them. Carefully lift and ease into the pan, making as even a circle as possible. Pat it firmly into place and seal the two ends togeather with a little water and a good pinch.
     Let rise for 45 minutes or more at room temperature.
     Preheat oven to 375 deg F.   Bake for 45 minutes, or until it gives off a  hollow sound when thumped. It should be medium brown on top.
     Remove the babka from the pan and invert on a plate, so the  cinnamon/sugar/nut coating is on top. Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing.

Yield 1 large coffee cake ring.

This is an Eastern European-style, not too sweet, coffee cake. It can be considered a cakey bread or a bready cake. It keeps well. You can freeze chunks or individually wrapped slices.

Once the dough is in the tube pan, it can be refrigerated until baking time.  Store for a day or two, wrapped airtight in a large plastic bag. it can go directly into a hot oven from the refrigerator.

Several weeks ago, I sent in this recipe to the list, along with thanks to all of you who sent me recipes for and suggestions about making Babka. I used everything I learned and came up with the following recipe. It tastes wonderful and works every time.

Don't try this recipe without flour in  hand.

Well, disappointingly this recipe was soooo wet that I ended up having to
add an additional 7 Tablespoons of flour and still the dough was somewhat
slack - very different than Meilach describes bagel dough should be in
her Best Bagels book.

The cinnamon raisin bagels turned out the best, as they were very close
to the texture of the best bagels I have purchased in bakeries.  German
states not to give a second rise after the bagels are shaped - to proceed
right away to boiling.  This produced the closest thing to a real bagel. [Angela]

it beeps and shuts off.  Roll dough out on floured board to a large thin
rectangle, 22 by 14 inches.  Brush dough with melted butter.  Combine filling
ingredients.  Sprinkle dough with this mixture.  Roll jellyroll fashion,
starting with long edge.  Seal edges, slice into 10-20 rolls.  Place cut side
down on baking sheet, or even better, put in a greased sugared glass baking
disk.  Cover and let rise in a warm place till doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees, 20-25 minutes.  Brush with melted butter
Drizzle with icing.

This stuff makes the most fantastic toast.  It's also not bad
untoasted.  We have made it successfully making the bread as listed,
but adding only 1 Tbsp of white sugar and no cinnamon at the beginning,
and then adding a cinnamon/brown sugar mixture 30 s. or a minute before
the end of the last kneading cycle.  The sugar/cinnamon ends up marbled
through the bread, and it is wonderful  (hard to get right though)

  Roll each biscuit flat and wrap around a greased clothespin.  Place

  Remove clothespin from each roll, slit open, and fill with deviled

  I had a very hard time visualizing this.  Unless, they look like
  hollowed out hot dog buns, and they are literally stuffed with
  the mixture.  (Try to visualize wiener wraps.)

Now me, I'd use a nice quality bread/roll dough, stuff them with pate

Yeast-free bread recipe

(from Pillsbury's BREADS, BREADS, and more BREADS, 1983)
(In the original, the recipe called for a specific brand name of flour.  I don't think this needs to be specified here.)

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease two 9X5 loaf pans. In large bowl, combine dry ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined. (Lumps of brown sugar will case dark spots in bread.) Slowly add buttermilk, stirring until
well blended. Pour into prepared pans. Bake at 350F for 50 to 60 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Remove from pans immediately; cool on wire racks. Serve warm or cool.

I must warn you that every time I've made this, one of the loaves has come out with a creative hump in the middle. Some of them have been quite humourous. (The one that my friend thought was a tribute to my
husband, however, was a little embarassing at a potluck!)

Makes 2 loaves

  3 1/2           cups  bread flour -- General Mills
                        -- Better for Bread
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  honey
  1 1/2           cups  water
  3        tablespoons  butter -- margarine will
                        work, but not as well
     1/4           tsp  salt
  2        tablespoons  yeast -- I prefer Red Star

Dissolve honey and water.  The warmer they are, the easier they'll
mix.  Add the yeast, whisk it all together, and set aside.

Blend the flours and salt, and melt the butter in a separate dish.
Once melted, add the butter to the yeast/honey/water mixture.  Whisk
together.

Add liquid to dry ingredients and knead down on a floured board.  You
could also mix the ingredients with a Kitehcn-Aid mixer (dough hook
attachment), then transfer to a floured board.  When finished, the
dough should be very soft, but not too sticky.  Let rise until
doubled.

Punch down, knead on a floured board, and divide into two loaves.
Shape into cylinders, or round balls, or whatever shape you prefer.
Let rise until 2 to 2 1/2 times original size.  Score if desired, or
glaze with one beaten egg.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

This bread works best when cooked with stoneware.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  flour
  1                Cup  cornmeal
  4          Teaspoons  baking powder
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  1                Cup  milk -- soured by adding a
                        -- tsp cider vinegar (1 to 1 1/4)
     1/2      Teaspoon  salt
  2        Tablespoons  vegetable oil


Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Put oil into cast iron skillet and put in oven
while you mix all of the other ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Add
enough milk to the batter until it is the consistency of pancake batter,
which is thinner than most people make it.  Stir only until mixed, then
remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and pour the oil into your
batter. ( Some of it will stay in the pan which is okay as it will make the
crust very brown and crisp)  Mix the oil in lightly then pour the batter
into the hot skillet and return to the oven.  Bake 25-30 minutes.

My mother was a southern cook and made the most delicious cornbread.  Part
of the secret is baking it in a cast iron skillet.

                        -- 1 1/2 Lb Loaf:
  3 1/2           Cups  bread flour
     1/2             C  yellow cornmeal

  1                 Lg  egg
  2 1/2            Tsp  dry yeast

follow manufactures instructions for the breadmaker. Use basic bread cycle.
Store cooled bread, tightly wrapped.

Remember that cornmeal will give a slighly crunchy texture, nutty taste etc
and that cornmeal yeast based breads
will not be similar to " cake " types of quickbread cornbread.
Cornmeal also contains no gluten and thus will
not contribute to any rising properties of bread.

     3/4             C  Dried Cranberries -- (Add Near End Of
                         -- kneading)


I prefer to bake this as a round loaf in my oven.  I brush the loaf with
egg white glaze - mix orange juice with the egg white if you think of
it.  I bake it at 350 for about 25-30 minutes.  Of course you can let the
bread machine bake it.

I use this same recipe to make bagels.  Follow your favorite bagel
routine.  THis dough is stiff enough for bagels using my fresh ground
whole wheat flour, but reduce the orange juice about 2 T to start with if
you are using purchased whole wheat flour.  You could also do a
combination of flours and start with the lesser amount of liquid.

This is my very favorite bread.  We have a local bakery that makes this
bread and I was addicted to it before I discovered a bread machine.

It's a special treat for Thanksgiving or other

improver you'll probably just want to leave it out and use bread flour.  If
you want more of these recipes by weight, I'm happy to post some more.

  16                Oz  cherries -- drained, **
     1/4           Cup  cherry juice -- reserved from above
     1/4           Cup  Water -- Approximate
     1/8      Teaspoon  ginger


*(I used 1- bread, 2 whole wheat 1/2 tablespoon gluten )
**(I prefer cherries to blueberries)

It rose almost to the dome ( welbilt breadmaker ) - which is higher than
I normally get for a bread with 2/3 whole wheat.  However this could be
due to high suger content of cherries.

I read in a food section of some paper that adding 1/8 teaspoon of ginger
to the bread mix helped it raise.  Anyone know anything about that ???

I tried it last night on a modified version of DAK's blueberry bread
(tastes good with cream cheese for breakfast).

whole wheat flour with some baking powder mixed in, tasted really good)

DAMPER #2        bushies recipe!

Take one bag of flour and one can of beer, mix thoroughly and bake until

Hope the damper turns out right and the kids enjoy this little touch of Oz!
:-)

While browsing the Web I came across a Perth (Australia) restaurant, with an
email address, so wrote to them explaining the problem and asking if they could
send me a recipe for Damper, which is the name given to a variety of bread cooked
by outback travellers in the  ashes of a camp fire.   The name derives from the
word "damper" meaning something that satisfies appetite, as in a snack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           Cups  Dill Pickles -- *Note, Juice
  2                Tbs  oil -- (I like olive)
  1                 Tb  dried dill weed
  3               Cups  bread flour -- (+)
  2                Tbs  sugar
  2                Tsp  active dry yeast


Place ingredients ( 80 to 100 degrees ) in your breadmaker per manufactures
instructions. Add more flour ( or liquid ) if needed to achieve a dough ball
that is pliable and slightly tacky ( no dough adheres to your finger when
touched ) and bake on the white bread cycle.

* I strain the pickle juice ( ex Clausens ) saving the bits of garlic and
chili etc but discarding the hard pepper corns etc.Youll find various brands
of juices may be more garlicky etc. so find your favorite.

I add no additional salt to the recipe as the brine contains plenty
As for the olive bread, I find that 1/4 cup of liquid brine was sufficient.
It was plenty tasty. You could add more brine and less water for your
experimentations.Coarse chop olives or they may be to finely incorporated
into the bread.

I have never added chopped pickle to the dill pickle rye bread but a firm
chopped pickle could be added.

These breads were wonderful for last weekends family barbecue and devoured.
I've made these breads plenty of times and you should have a beautiful tall
moist loaf. You can email me if you have questions.

My breadmaker is a toastmaster platinum plus. Ive also done these recipes
in the dak and wellbuilt when I owned them .

P.S. I use SAF or Fleischmans Gold star yeast which I personally feel does a
better job than Red Star. And I use Bakers and Chef's Flour that I buy at
Sams. Just mentioning this if you wondered what I used. Enjoy!

Variation:
OLIVE BREAD:
use this liquid ratio to the
3 cups bread flour:
1 cup water
1/4 cup olive brine,  liquid
2 tbs oil
2 tbs sugar
1/2 cup olives,  coarse chopped
(salad olives)
2 tsp yeast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  cottage cheese
  2        Tablespoons  sugar
  1         Tablespoon  onion flakes
  1         Tablespoon  fresh dill weed -- dill seed
  1           Teaspoon  salt
     1/4      Teaspoon  baking soda
  2                     Egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
  1            package  yeast -- not instant
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour
     1/2      teaspoon  diet margarine -- (Fleischman's)
                        --brush on after baking

     Have eggs at room temperature. Heat the cottage cheese until barely warm to
touch, about 110 degrees. Mix the cottage cheese in large bowl along with sugar,
onion, dill, salt, baking soda, eggs and yeast.
     Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff batter. Beat well after each
addition with an electric mixer flat beater, or use a wooden spoon if mixing by
hand. Since this is a heavy batter, not a dough, it will not be kneaded.
     Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place for 1 hour or
more. Remove the plastic wrap and stir down the batter with 20-25 strong
strokes. Spoon the batter into a greased 1-1/2 quart casserole dish. Cover with
wax paper and leave until the batter doubles in size, about 45 minutes. Keep the
waxed paper from touching the batter or it may collapse when the paper is pulled
away. Bake in a PREHEATED 350-degree oven for 40-45 minutes or until deep brown
and crusty. Test with a wooden toothpick and if it does not come out clean, then
bake 5-8 minutes longer.
     Remove bread from oven and immediately brush with the margarine. Sprinkle
with salt if desired. You might use coarse salt as an interesting variation.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2              C  Flour
  2        tablespoons  Sugar
  1         tablespoon  dried onions -- minced
  2          teaspoons  Dill Seed
     2/3      teaspoon  Salt
     1/4      teaspoon  Baking Soda
  2          teaspoons  Yeast

  1                     Egg
  1                cup  creamed cottage cheese


The 2.5 C flour is kinda odd, but it was half of the published 5 C.
I show 2 tsp yeast because most machines use a little more than
the Hitachi and I use a little extra on the "rapid" setting.

The bread is quite good.  I've avoided dill bread probably because of
my brain associating it w/ dill pickles, but I remember my mother
making this when I was a kid.  It was recently re-published in the
the Baltimore_Sun, so I gave it a try.  Also, I ignored all instructions
about heating things on the stove and cooling back down etc..  Just
Nuked the cottage cheese for a few seconds to take the chil off.

  2 1/2              T  sugar
  2                  T  active dry yeast
     1/4             T  salt
  6                  T  Rice Flour -- Do Not Use Oriental
                        Rice Flour -- Or Sweet Rice Flour
  1                  T  vegetable oil
     1/3             C  warm water -- approx 110 deg F


When your dough is in the bowl for its first rise, make the topping.
In a 4-cup bowl, stir together the sugar, yeast, salt, and rice flour.
Add the vegetable oil and warm water, and stir to blend well.  Some
rice flours will thicken more than others, so add liquid until the
mixture resembles a thick paste.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until very bubbly and at least double
in size; this will take about 30 minutes.  When the dough is shaped,
stir down and spread half of the mixture evenly over the top of each
loaf.  (If you have to delay the shaping of the loaves, stir down the
topping and set aside.)  Let rise again as directed in the basic bread
recipe, then bake.

 (for 2 loaves)

I found the following recipe in the Fanny Farmer cookbook.  It should
be easy to adapt for use with the bread machine.  Just divide it in
half, and mix up the topping about 35 minutes before the end of the
dough cycle.  I think you'll want to bake Dutch Crunch bread in the
oven in a loaf pan, because you want your loaf to have a good big
surface for the Dutch Crunch topping.  I tried this recipe out and
thought it was quite good.    ...Nadia

                Breads, Quick/Muffins/Rolls     Hand Made


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  bread flour -- *NOTE
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- (+/- to taste)
  1                  T  Gluten Flour, 100%
  1                cup  warm water
  2          teaspoons  molasses
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  oil
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yeast
     1/4      teaspoon  honey
                        In Glass Measuring Cup Mix Together:
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water -- **NOTE
     1/4      teaspoon  honey

This recipe makes a slightly dense chewey, bagel-like bread in less than an hour with minimal effort.  The added gluten makes the bread moist while retaining a good crumb structure.  The honey and molasses give the bread a mildly sweet taste and a nice color. Experiment with different flour combinations.  My favorite is 1 cup oat flour mixed with 2 cups white or whole wheat.  Whole oats grains, dried fruits or vegetables can be added for flavor.

*NOTE (unbleached white, ww, oat, rye or combo 2 or more)
**NOTE (90-105 F; feel slightly warm when tested on inside of wrist)

Set mixture aside and let it rise for several minutes.  Place the flour, salt
and wheat gluten in a 4 cup or larger microwave safe bowl.  When the yeast
mixture has risen sufficiently, add it to the flour.  In the same measuring
cup measure 1 cup warm water, 2 teaspoons
each of honey and molasses, and 1 teaspoon of oil.  Stir to dissolve then add
to the flour mixture.  Mix together the dough, adding  additional water as
necessary to work all of the flour in to the dough.  When dough is ready to
knead, place a large jar of water in the microwave and heat on HIGH until it
begins to boil (6-8 minutes).  While water is boiling, knead the dough
(either in the bowl or on the counter).

To bake, you can use the same bowl that you mixed the dough in, or use
another microwave safe dish.  I like to use a lidded ceramic baking dish
which I have preheated in the microwave by placing in it a small container of
water and heating it at the same time as the jar of water.  If using a bowl,
lightly oil it.  After kneading, place the dough back in the bowl or other
baking dish, coating one side with oil then turning so that the oil side is
up.  Place the dough in the microwave along with the jar of water that you
previously heated.  Microwave on lowest power setting for 20-25 minutes until
doubled in bulk.  Microwave on HIGH setting 6-8 minutes.  Bread is done when
it springs back after pressing the crust.  Remove the bread from the
microwave and invert the bowl to remove the bread.  If you prefer a browned
crust, microwave the dough on HIGH 4-5 minutes then finish cooking in a 425
oven until nicely browned (if using a bowl in the microwave, invert the loaf
onto an oven safe baking sheet).

I imagine this dough could also be used as a pizza dough... especially if you
partially bake it in the micro then finish it in the regular oven.

                        purpose flour with
                        more cereal.

Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Add all purpose flour, honey,
margarine and salt. Beat on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly.
Beat on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally (or beat 300
vigourous strokes by hand). Stir in whole wheat flour and cereal until well
blended. Scrape batter from side of bowl. Cover and let rise in warm place
40-45 minutes or unitl almost double.

Spray loaf pan, 9x5x3 or 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches, with nonstick cooking
spray. Stir down batter by beating about 25 strokes. Spread batter in pan.
Smooth and pat batter, using floured hand. Cover and let rise in warm place
about 30 minutes or until double. (Batter is ready if indentation remains
when touched with floured finger).

Heat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until loaf
sounds hollow when tapped. Remove loaf from pan; cool on wire rack.

I am posting an excellent recipe for a pizza crust.  It can be made
by hand, in a food processor, or in a bread machine.  As well, I have
even made bread sticks with this recipe.  The dough can be frozen for a
couple of weeks with no problem.

Add 1 teaspoon sugar to the warm water.  Sprinkle the yeast on top of
the water and mix.  Let rise for about 5 minutes.
To the food processor add flour, oil, salt, and sugar.  Pulse off/on
a couple of times to mix.
While the food processor is running, add proofed yeast/water mixture.
 Let flour mixture combine with the liquid and knead for about 1 minute until dough is smooth.
Add more water or flour, if necessary to get a smooth dough.
Let dough rest for 5 minutes before rolling out.
Makes 2- 12" pizzas or 1- 15" large deep-dish.
Bake dough at 425F.

In one of the previous digests, someone mentioned an ad for "The Bread
Machine Cookbook" from Simmer Pot Press in NC.  I sent for the book
and got it in a week or so.  I have tried a half dozen recipies so
far and can report that it is excellent.  Unlike the DAK recipies, these
seem to always come out excellent and just as described.  I have
the Wellbuilt glass domed R2D2 machine (the same as the DAK.
Here is my favorite so far.  This bread is great toasted with a little
marmalade on it.  Makes a great no-fat breakfast.  If you like this,
buy the book because there appear to be many more like it.

The bread will have a flat or slightly concave top and a wonderful texture.
If you are around during the final rising, sprinkle a little yellow cornmeal
on the top for a nice touch.

flour, 1/4 c at a time, until the dough is a rough, shaggy mass.  If using a
mixer, change to the dough hook.

2) Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead with a strong
push-turn-fold motion until the dough is smooth, elastic, and feels alive
under your hands.  Inthe mixer, the dough will clean the sides of the bowl and
form a ball around the hook and move with it.  If the dough sould continue to
be sticky, add liberal sprinkles of flour.  Knead for 10 minutes.

3) Pat the ball fo dough with lightly greased fingertips and place in a bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature to double in size,
about 1 hour.

4)  Punch down the dough, knead for 30 seconds, and set aside to rest for 1
minutes.  Sprinkle the work surface with cornmeal and turn the dough onto it.
Roll out the dough until it is 1/4" thick.  If it resists the rolling pin and
pulls back, let it rest for 1 or 2 minutes.  Cut into 3" round (4" for eggs
Benedict) with a cookie cutter.

5)  Sprinkle the work surface with cornmeal and put the rounds under a towel.
Let  rise until they are doubled in size to about 1/2" thick, 45 minutes.

6)  Heat the electric griddle to 325 deg. or preheat teh oven to 450 deg 20
minutes before baking.

7)  Bake the muffins for 2 min on each side.  Do not cook fast, so avoid the
hot center of the griddle; place the muffins around the sides of the griddle.
Reduce heat and bake for 6 additional minutes on each side or a total of about
16 minutes.  Don't scorch.

8)  If using th oven, place the cut muffins on teh baking sheet and bake for
15 min, turning them over after 6 or 7 minutes.  They will rise and swell to
look rather like puffballs. (if using a convection oven, reduce heat 50 deg.)

9)  Remove the muffins fromt eh griddle ro baking sheet.  Cool on a metal rack
before toasting.  Pull apart with the tines of a fork, or the fingers, to
toast.

These freeze well and keep for months inthe deep freeze at 0 deg.

Use a raisin bread or a sweet bread recipie, but add about 3/4 tsp
of cardamom instead of cinnamon.  It's good
with or without the raisins.  also try adding dried
candied fruit (sold for fruitcakes) instead of raisins.  The key is the
cardamom.

  1         Tablespoon  honey
  1                Cup  Water -- or more if nec

(more or less on the  quantities)

I use my breadmaker to make the dough of normal bread, more whole wheat than
plain flour then I use some extra white flour to make small balls, which later I flatten
out with a rolling pin (?) then comes the trick, for I have tried various ways,
but last night I put them in the oven, a recipe I had said 3 mins each side,
no way the first side was like 10 mins, it is till they blow up (more or less
nicely) and then 3 mins the other side.

What came out was not real flour tortillas, but was very good, first warm
they were good, and now cold they are nice and crispy.  My husband really
enjoyed them.

By the way I use these same things and quantities to make my bread.
In the bread I add various things, for instance caraway seeds, or garlic, or
raisins, whatever I feel like
The bread always comes out good.
So this is my always recipe for bread or dough.

As you can see my bread contains no salt or oil in any kind

Good luck if you try it

appetizer or with a buffet. Delicious served hot or cold, as a snack or with a

  1                Cup  water -- lukewarm
     1/4           Cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil -- or rosemary,chop,

  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast -- or rapid

I adapted from one of Donna Rathmell German's cookbooks (Flatbreads from around
the world). The origional recipe only called for 3 cups flour. It seems also to be a lot of oil, but it produces a large loaf and quite a savory crust. You will notice it's a ABM recipe.
    Add ingredients according to manufacturer's directions for your machine. Process on the Dough cycle (or process on normal cycle and remove after the first rise, about 1 hour). Punch down and shape into a 9- or 10-inch round.  Place in a deep dish pizza pan or on a baking sheet, cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free location for 30 to 40 minutes.  After dough has risen, brush it all over with olive oil, spread with finely slivered onion and/or garlic and more herbs. Press some of the onion/garlic slivers into the dough to form small identations. Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2              C  All-Purpose Flour -- Additional As Need
  1                Pkg  Yeast -- 2 1/4 Tsp
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  1                Tsp  Salt
  1                  C  Warm Water -- (120-130 Deg F.)
  1               Tbsp  Oil
                        Topping:
     1/2             C  Chopped onion
  2               Tbsp  Butter or margarine
     1/4           Tsp  Sugar
     1/8           Tsp  Salt

In large mixer bowl, combine 1 1/2 c. flour, yeast, 1 T. sugar and 1 t.
salt; mix well. Add water and oil to flour mixture. Blend at low speed
until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, gradually stir in
enough remaining flour to make a firm dough. Knead on floured surface 5 to
8 minutes, adding flour as needed. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease
top. Cover; let rise in warm place about 40 minutes (20 minutes for Quick
Rise yeast).

Prepare onion topping. In small skillet, saute onion in butter until soft.
Stir in 1/3 t. sugar and 1/8 t. salt.

Punch down dough. On lightly floured surface, shape dough into a ball.
Place on greased cookie sheet. Flatten to a 10-inch circle. With table
knife, cut a circle in dough about 1 inch from edge, cutting almost through
to cookie sheet. Prick center with a fork. Spread Onion Topping over the
pricked dough. Cover; let rise in warm place about 30 minutes (15 minutes
for Quick Rise). Bake at 375 deg. for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.

Variation. Omit Onion Topping. Instead of pricking top, cut a criss-cross
design with a sharp knife. Brush bread with an egg glaze made by combining
1 egg yolk and 1 T. milk or water. Sprinkle with sesame seed if desired.

  1 3/4            Tsp  Yeast -- Fast Rising
  2               Tbsp  margarine


I took it out at the end of the first rise- kneaded it a bit - then pushed
it out on a pizza pan to roughly 12 inches. Threw some olive oil and pesto
that I was using together - roughly 1/2 & 1/2 - about 4 tbsp. - patted this
mix all over the round- let rise 20 minutes and threw into a 425 degree
oven for 20 minutes. Very well received and then I started another loaf of
bread for breakfast.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               Tbsp  Yeast -- Or 1 Cake Of Yeast
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2           Cups  water -- lukewarm
  2          Teaspoons  salt
  4               Cups  flour -- sifted
  1                     Egg White -- Slightly Beaten With
  1         Tablespoon  water -- (egg glaze)

Dissolve the yeast in the water.  Sift the dry ingredients, stir them
into the yeast mixture, and work the dough with your hands until it
will absorb no more flour.  Knead the dough on a slightly floured
board until it is no longer sticky.  Place the dough in a buttered
bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled.  Then punch it down and turn
it out onto a floured board.  Divide into 2 parts.  Shape each piece
into a long, narrow loaf.  Place the loaves on a greased cookie sheet
that has been sprinkled with cornmeal, cover, and let rise again
(until doubled in size).  Brush tops with egg-white glaze (1 egg white
slightly beaten with 1 Tablespoon of water) and bake in a 400 degree
over for 35 to 40 minutes.  Brush again with glaze about 5 minutes
before loaves are done.  Makes 2 small loaves or 1 large one.

[Optional:  for those with HOT ovens:  bake bread at 400 degrees for
first 15 minutes then reduce temperature to 350 degrees for next
20-25 minutes.]

DAK & WELBILT Breadmaker owners/users:
Put 2 cups of flour in breadmaker, add 1 Tablespoon of fast
rising yeast, add another 2 cups of flour, the sugar,
salt and increase the warm water to 1-3/4 Cups and add to
the breadmaker and select French Bread - Manual.  Push Start.
Let dough be kneaded by breadmaker and leave it in the breadmaker for
the first rising (1 hour) - just when the breadmaker begins to knead
the bread again, take it out and punch it down onto a lightly floured
board.  Follow recipe above from "divide into 2 parts" etc.

(Yes, I know the breadmaker says only 3.5 cups of flour but if you
increase the warm water to 1-3/4 cups it can handle the kneading and
it does a great job!)

ONION FRENCH BREAD. Add 1 package onion-soup mix to the dry
ingredients and blend thoroughly.  If you like an onion flavor in
bread, you may occasionally add a package of onion soup mix to any
plain bread dough with delightful results.


Adapted from "A World of Breads"

This is about as authentic a French bread as you can make in a home
oven. To make real French bread, you need unbleached, hard-wheat flour
(available in health food stores), and an oven with the heat coming
from top, bottom and both sides.

If you place a pan of boiling water on the oven floor, and
sprinkle the cookie sheets with cornmeal after
buttering them, you can approximate the commercial product.

N.B.:  To me, this is the ** secret ** the 1/2 inch of boiling water
which I place in a glass pyrex (12 inch pie plate) and put in the
bottom of the oven SEEMS to do the trick when it comes to a crusty
outside (but not too thick) on French Bread; be sure to bake your
bread on the lowest oven rack.

  Combine milk, shortening, sugar and salt stir until shortening melts. Cool
  to 105-115.  Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Stir in
  milk mixture, eggs and flavorings.
   Gradually stir in flour to make a soft dough.  Turn dough out onto a
  floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 5 min. Place
  in a  well greased bowl, turning to greast top.
   Cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts, 1 hr. or until
  doubled in bulk. (Watch closely, it usually doubles in no time at all).
  Punch dough down and divide in half. Turn dough out onto a lightly
floured   board.  Roll each half into a 12 x 6" rectangle. Brush 2 T butter over
top  of each.  Cut each rectangle into 6 1" strips. Stack 6 strips of dough,
  butter side up on top of one another. Cut each stack into 12 pieces
about  1" wide.  Place in well buttered muffin cups sideways.
   (cut side down) Cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts
for 30   min.  Bake at 425 for 10-12 minutes.

  Makes 48 rolls.

 These were originally posted by BARBARA and are really great. I nominate
  them for the hall of fame !!!

NOTES : 1 egg = 1/4 cup egg sub.

This is well worth the time involved to make the pear puree. Fresh pears should
be boiled in water until soft; canned pears should be rinsed. Puree in blender
or food processor. Pepper may be omitted for a different taste, and dried
pears, found in some grocery stores or health food stores, may be added for
another variation.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For Water Starter:
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
     1/2             C  Warm Water -- Or Milk, *Note
  1                  C  Milk
  1                  C  Flour
  1                  C  Granulated Sugar

*NOTE:  If you use milk, add 1/2 C milk, 1 C flour and 1 C granulated sugar.

Set in a warmish place, like near the stove, and stir once daily for 5-10 days.  This makes about 3 cups of
starter.  Most recipies for friendship bread that I've seen  call for one cup of starter to start out with, so as tradition dictates I would keep a cup of starter for myself and give the other two cups to two friends with the recipie.

  2                Tsp  Vanilla

My sister-in-law gave me a recipe for Amish Friendship Bread along with
a jar-full of the starter mix.  Here is the recipe:

***Do not use metal spoon
***Do not refrigerate dough!!

day 1 -- Get starter and do nothing
day 2 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 3 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 4 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 5 -- Add 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk and stir
day 6 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 7 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 8 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 9 -- Stir once each day with wooden spoon
day 10 - Add 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk and stir.
         pour into containers of 1 cup each and give to 3 friends
         with copy of recipe (or 2 friends and keep 1 start for yourself)

Pour into 2 well greased and sugared loaf pans.  Bake 40 to 50 min.
at 350 degrees.  Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan.  The bread
may be frozen for a later date.  (note the starter)

Okay, this is my question:  what's the starter recipe?  Is it a secret?
or is it just 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup milk?  It sure smells good!
thanks!

rectangle and spread with filling ingredients. Jelly-roll starting at the
wide end, pinch the ends and cut into rolls. Place in 1 or 2 greased
9-inch round or square cake pans. An alternative is to place each roll in
a greased muffin tin. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free location
approximately 1 hour. Pour whipping cream (room temperature) on top before
baking to glaze.

"The Complete Book of Bread Machine Baking", edited by Lara Pizzorno

Believe it or not, this bread is delicious and light.  My husband raved about
it.  I didn't dare tell him what was in it!  I didn't have any garbanzo beans
so I used pinto beans.  I also substituted sugar for the sucanat.  I was out
of gluten flour so I used bread flour in place of half of the whole wheat
flour.  With half bread flour, the loaf I made- that was nice and light-
probably had a significantly different texture than it would have had
otherwise.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Tsp  yeast
  1                Tsp  sugar
  2 1/3           Cups  flour
  2               Tbsp  cornmeal
  1                Tsp  salt
  2               Tbsp  olive oil
  3             Cloves  garlic -- crushed
     1/2           Tsp  Herbes de Provence
     1/2           Tsp  black pepper
     3/4           Cup  water

Heat the oil and garlic and herbs and pepper, until the garlic is clear
and it smells good

Then Add the water to the bread mix

Use the dough cycle and roll out into 8 rounds.  You can cook it on
the grill (watch carefully) or in the oven.

I made the following dough in my bread machine, rolled into 8 circles
and cooked it on the gas grill.  It should be just as good cooked as
a loaf of bread. A wood fire would probably give a wonderful taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  buttermilk -- Fresh gluten-free
     1/4             c  Butter -- melted
  1           teaspoon  Rice vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Salt
  2               cups  Brown rice flour
     1/3           cup  Potato starch flour
     1/3           cup  Tapioca flour
     1/4           cup  Sugar
  3 1/2      teaspoons  Xanthan gum
  3                     Eggs
     1/2           cup  Water
                        --for Welbilt/DAK and Zoji machines
                        -- add 2 Tbsp. more water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Active dry yeast

 Place the buttermilk, melted butter, rice vinegar, and salt in bread
  pan. Stir with a rubber spatula.

  In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except the yeast.
  Mix well with a whisk.

  In a separate bowl, combine the eggs and water; beat lightly.

  Place 1/2 of the dry ingredients in the bread pan. Add the egg
  mixture. Add the remainder of the dry ingredients; sprinkle the yeast
  on top. Select Light Crust setting and press Start.

  Observe the dough frequently during the kneading cycles. If it does
  not appear to be mixing well, use a rubber spatula to assist it
  occasionally.

  After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on wire
  rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

  Variations:  You can substitute olive oil for the butter. Replace 1/4
  to 1/2 cup of the rice flour with another gluten-free flour, such as
  yellow or blue corn flour, polenta meal, or soy flour. You can add at
  least 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese for a new flavor. Saute some
  onions in the melted butter, allow them to cool, then add them and
  your favorite herbs to create an onion/herb bread.

  Optional bake cycle:  Sweet bread, Rapid bake.

     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  butter
                        -- 2 tbs which is vegetable shortening
     1/2           cup  coffee -- hot, strong, boiling
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar -- firmly packed
     1/2           cup  molasses -- dark
  1                     egg -- well beaten
     1/3           cup  mincemeat -- OPTIONAL
                        or candied orange peel

This is a wonderful recipe.

  Gingerbread goes well back to middle ages and earlier.  Ladies would
  bestow favours of gingerbread, some ornately tooled to look like velvet
  or leather boxes, to knights during tournaments.  They were decorated
  with cloves, gold and silver leaf, and were sometimes even in the
  shape of religious icons.  Gingerbread was sold at faires and gatherings
  like we sell our hotdogs and popcorn of today.  In the netherlands there
  were mansized gingerbread molds.  Gingerbreads can be traced to
  German, Italian, Swiss and Austrian cuisine.  These gingerbreads of
  old were highly decorated, gilded and painted with colored sugars.
  Gingerbread molds are prized by antique collectors.

  In colonial american days, the molds were of wood and recipes were
  considered signature and guarded with pride.  It was a custom to add
  mincemeat or candied fruits to the ginerbread as well.

  The hot coffee added to this recipe is what forms the moist gooey glaze
  which has a hint of a slight crackle to it, as you bite into it.  Its
  heaven when warm.  The recipe is attributed to George Washington's Mother.
  It has been referenced in two old books in my keeping, and also featured
  by Woman's Day.  I am sure this recipe can be traced back to England and
  is dated in the early 1600's.  I am positive it is of british decent.  It
  has been adapted to modern measurements.

 I DON'T add the mincemeat or candied fruit. [Katie]

 Sift dry ingredients together.  Add butter/shortening to boiling
  coffee and stir until dissolved.  Add sugar and molasses to same
  mixture.  Combine with dry ingredients; add beated egg and continue
  to beat until batter is smooth.  (Fold in mincemeat if using.)  Butter
  and lightly flour 9 inch square pan or small loaf pan.  Pour in batter
  and bake in preheated 350F oven for 35 to 40 minutes.  Cut and
  serve warm or with Lemon Sauce or Whipped Cream.

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads, Quick/Muffins/Rolls
                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  active dry yeast -- (instant)
                        -- or 2 T active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  6               cups  bread flour -- unbleached, (6 to 7)
  3                     egg whites -- at room temperature
                        seasoning that I use:
                        Ingredients are not in specific
                        measurements. They are added to taste.
                        Dried rosemary
                        basil
                        granulated garlic
                        garlic salt
                        -- medium chopped yellow or white onion
                        corn meal
                        olive oil

Meringue the egg whites. Add water. Add shortening,salt, sugar and 3
C flour. Add instant yeast. Mix well. Mix in enough flour to form a mass
then knead dough, either by hand or with KA until medium stiff. Go
through the regular process to proof the dough till doubled.
The following procedure is my personal style; you just need a flat
surface to deal with it.
Place dough in half-sheet pan and spred out evenly. Brush with olive
oil sprinkle chopped onions evenly, sprinkle rosemar, basil, garlic
and garlic salt. Fold dough in thirds. With a dough scraper, chop the
entire mass into medium size pieces 1/2"-1 1/2" being sure to spread
the seasonings evenly as possible. Using a scale, use handfuls of the
dough to weigh a 7 oz. pile, then transfer to a half sheet pan. One half
sheet pan will hold 6 piles of dough. With each pile of dough, generally
shape like a bun. With each pile brush lightly with olive oil, vey
lightly sprinkle corn meal (almost as though it was to be used as a
garnish) and garlic salt. Let rise, then bake at 425 for approximately
25 minutes. The end product should be crispy and appealing to the
nose and the eye.
The procedure sounds complicated, but in reality, its not. You are
just taking that dough, adding the seasonings, chopping it up, then
making cow pies. The Focaccias that I have seen previously seem to have
one solid piece of bread with some seasoning on top. In my style, the
seasonings are much more integrated. You can eat it like a tear away
bread. The key for the crisp crust is the egg whites that have been
meringued.

                        ABM-100/300/350:
  1                Pkg  yeast
  3               Cups  bread flour
     1/4           Cup  sugar

  2                  T  shortening -- (80 deg)
  1                     egg -- (room temp)


SETTING: White Bread / MANUAL

Cinnamon rolls like grandma used to make!  Hot coffee and maple flavor give the
glaze an extra-special flavor.
(These are GREAT!  Be prepared to eat a half a dozen of them the first time you
make 'em!)

After the machine has completed  the second rising, it  will beep.  Remove  the
dough onto a lightly  floured surface, roll or  pat to a 12x9-inch  rectangle.
Brush with 1/4 cup melted butter.  Combine 6 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 cup chopped
nuts and 3/4 teaspoons  cinnamon; sprinkle over dough.   Starting with  shorter
side, roll up tightly.  Pinch  edge to seal.  Cut into  12 slices.  Place in  a
greased 13x9-inch pan.  Cover;  let rise in warm  place until almost double  in
volume - about  30 minutes  - (this  took MUCH  longer for  me.)   Bake at  375
degrees, 20 to 25 minutes.

Glaze:  Combine  1 cup  powdered sugar, 1  1/2 tablespoons  melted butter,  1/4
teaspoon maple  flavor and  2 tablespoons  hot coffee.   Blend  until  smooth.
Drizzle over hot baked rolls.

Melt the yeast, sugar, 1/3 c. warm water in a bowl and set aside.  Mix
the flours, salt, in a bowl, add the yeast mix, and then the water.
Mix the dough until smooth, about 5 mins.  Let rise covered with a
damp cloth for one hour. Punch down, and divide into two or four
loaves, then slice tops about 2 inch across, 1/4 inch deep.  Place in
cold oven set to 350 for one hour.  For crustier bread, place a pan of
water on the bottom of the stove for 1st 30 minutes, then remove.
Also, you can brush the loaves with a mixture of egg-white and 1/2 c.
water after 50 mins.

2 o'clock

This tender bread is almost as rich as a  cake and keeps well.  It may be  made
completely in the bread machine or braided and baked in a conventional oven.

Before the end of the secondary  kneading, the electronic beeper will sound  10
times.  At this signal,  add the chopped almonds:   1/4 cup for the ABM-100,  3
tablespoons for the ABM-300/350.

NOTES : * 14/ egg= 1 T egg sub or 1/3 egg= 1.5 T egg sub.
Traditionally, this loaf is twisted and has a topping of sesame seeds. A great
breakfast or brunch bread. If desired, open the machine briefly during the
second rising and sprinkle sesame seeds on the top of the dough. Be careful not
to spill any into the machine itself.

NOTES : This traditional Greek bread is usually served with one coin hidden
inside which bestows luck upon the finder. I do not recommend including it in
the bread as it might damage the machine. (You could add a single raisin added
at the beep, if desired.) St. Basil's bread is a delicious, sweet bread which
disappears quickly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/8           Cups  water
  1           Teaspoon  coconut extract -- optional
  1         Tablespoon  olive oil
  2        Tablespoons  malt powder -- or honey / sugar
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  3 1/3           Cups  bread flour
  1         Tablespoon  wheat gluten -- optional
  2          Teaspoons  yeast
     1/2           Cup  dried pineapple -- diced
     5/8           Cup  dried coconut -- shredded or flaked


Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed.  Add the pineapple
and coconut 5 minutes before the end of the Kneading phase or work into the
dough before shaping.  Use the dough setting. Or stop the machine after the
rises.

Prepare the baking sheets or use nonstick sheets.
Remove dough from the machine, punch it down, and roll it out into a rectangle
about 14 x 18.  Divide into equal pieces and shape into bagel form or use a
cutter.  Place the bagels on the sheets and let them rise again.  I put them in
the oven to provide a draft free location.

This rise can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending on what else is
going on in your life.

Fill a 4 to 6 qt soup pot with water 3 to 4 " deep.  You can add 2 T of malt
syrup, honey, sugar or non-diastatic malt powder.  Get the water to boiling.

Preheat the oven to 400.

Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water.  Boil only 3 or 4 at a
time so they don't crowd.  Simmer each side for a minute and return to the
baking sheet.

Add glazes or toppings as desired.

Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven.  The book calls for
20 to 25 minutes.  I usually start at 15 minutes for the 1st sheet and less for
the second.

These are best eaten while they are still warm.  They can be frozen - you may
want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster.

     3/4             C  Hazelnuts -- chopped, (1/2 C)

*NOTE:  The original recipe used 3 T vegetable oil (2 T).

Biscotti are twice-baked cookies - a favorite Italian dessert.  They are
served with cappuccino, red wine or hot chocolate, and they keep so well
that you can always have a supply on hand.

Add all ingredients except the hazelnuts in the order suggested by your
bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.

At the beeper (or at the end of the first kneading in the Panasonic or
National), add the hazelnuts.  Let cool or eat warm.

To make biscotti, preheat your oven to 350 deg F.  Slice cooled bread 1/2"
thick.  Cut slices into fingers 1" wide.  Place on baking sheet and toast
for 15 - 20 min.  The fresher the bread, the longer it needs to toast.
Let cool and store in airtight containers or freeze.

I didn't get to make this into biscotti as it smelled so good we went
ahead and ate it!!  This is an *excellent* bread.  Probably very good as
biscotti also...maybe next time.

be packaging the dry ingredients in zip-lock bags, labeling with instructions

WHY THIS BOOKLET

Dear Fellow Breadmaker,

	Welcome to the wonderful world of bread baking using your
DAK AutoBakery!!

	Over the past year we've been collecting tips and suggestions
from fellow bread-making DAKonians (and coming up with a few of our
own from the DAK kitchen) and we'd like to pass a few of them on to
you. "Helpful Hints for DAK's AutoBakery from Customer Service" is
a compilation of those ideas. "Helps" include how to perform the self
test; what to do if the crust of your bread is too brown; cleaning
methods; what flour is best to use; and what to do if you live at a
high altitude.

	Again, DAK Breadmaker, thanks for your assistance and we look
forward to the opportunity to serve you in the future.

Happy baking!!

Your friends at DAK

				1.

--------

HOW MUCH GLUTEN SHOULD I ADD?

	What is Gluten? Wheat gluten is the natural protein derived
from wheat. It is basically wheat flour with the starch removed. It
will promote higher rising, improved shape, enhanced flavor, increased
protein, and extended freshness. Gluten may be ordered from DAK
(#5320) for $1.89 ($0.50 P&H) [this is a 10 oz. box], or you may find
it at a local health food store.

	In most recipes, adding one tablespoon of gluten will assist
in the loaf rising, but isn't mandatory.

(SUGGESTION: If bread flour is unavailable, and all purpose flour is
used, we recommend adding one tablespoon of gluten to all recipes
except the oat bran recipes.)

				2.

--------

WHAT'S THE BEST WATER TEMPERATURE TO USE?

	The ideal temperature for the water/liquid for use in the
recipe is 105 to 125 degrees F. As a guideline, the water should be
hot to the touch.

	What kind of liquid can I use? Very soft water will make a
soft, slicky dough that does not rise well. If your water is very
hard, you'll find that a tablespoon of cider vinegar or lemon juice
added to the water will make a better bread.

	Many liquids can be used in baking bread: water, milk,
fruit juice, soy milk, potato water, egg and others.

				3.

--------

WHAT'S THE BEST FLOUR TO USE?

	Of the brands on the market, we have found the following
work quite well:

	Pillsbury(TM) Bread Flour
	Gold Medal(TM) - Better For Bread (Yellow Package)
	King Arthur(TM) (East Coast)

				4.

--------

WHAT IF THE BREAD CRUST IS TOO BROWN

	We have found these options help keep the crust from be-
coming too brown:

	1) Reduce the amount of sugar by one to two tablespoons.

	2) Use honey in place of sugar, cutting the quantity in
	   half.

	3) Use the sweet bread setting instead of the recommended
	   setting.

	4) Use a sugar substitute and use the same recipe require-
	   ments as for sugar. (This may seem strange to those who
	   use sugar supplements in other ways. There will be no
	   aftertaste when the sugar supplement is cooked. There-
	   fore, a one to one ratio is used when using a sugar
	   substitute.) [Note: be sure that the substitute can
	   be heated/cooked; not all can.]

				5.

--------

ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT

	Those DAKonians who live in a high altitude area (3500 to
6500 feet) may find it necessary to make some altitude adjustments
in procedure. According to the high altitude directions on the Gold
Medal Better For Bread Flour(TM) package, "Rising time may be
slightly shorter". General Mills recommends that you start with
the minimum amount of flour the recipe calls for. Different brands
of "high altitude flour" may be purchased to compensate for the
difference in altitude.

				6.

--------

WHAT IF THE LOAVES RISE TOO HIGH?

	There are two ways to avoid this:

	1) Follow the recipe, measuring correctly.

	2) As the loaf rises, make a small hole in the loaf with
	   a toothpick just before it goes into the baking cycle.
	   (NOTE: Do not use a knife.)

	**To Make Cleanup easier: Coat the inside of the dome with
	Pam(TM) or other cooking spray.

				7.

-------

WHAT IF THE MIDDLE OR TOP OF THE LOAF IS UNCOOKED OR UNDERDONE?

	If this occurs, the following steps will assure that the loaf
is completely cooked.

	Between the last stage of fermentation and the baking cycle use
a baking brush to brush the top of the loaf with one of the following:

	1) A beaten egg with one to two tablespoons of water, mixed
	   into a fine glaze.

	2) Egg white, cream of tartar, and approximately one to two
           tablespoons of water mixed into a fine glaze.

	3) Melted butter.

	After brushing the top of the loaf and closing the lid, create
an aluminum foil "shield" to cover the outside of the dome.

HELPFUL COOKING HINTS

	When choosing to substitute ingredients, results may vary.
A few attempts may be necessary to obtain a successful loaf. If you
try a recipe substitute and find it successful, we'd appreciate
hearing about it. Please write to:

				DAK Industries
		  Customer Service Department - Auto Bakery
				  8200 Remmet
			    Canoga Park, CA  91304

	Some recipes call for egg whites. We have found that gently
folding the egg whites into the recipe works much better than simply
adding them into the ingredients.

				9.

HOW TO CLEAN THE AUTOBAKERY

	When cleaning the Autobakery, we have found the following
to be the most effective:

	1) A mild soap and water solution

	2) A cleanser such as "409"

	3) A white vinegar and water solution. (A 3 to 1 ratio
	of water to vinegar works best.)

	Use a damp sponge or cloth, and NEVER "flood" the Breadmaker
with any of the above solutions.

	As you know, you can remove the red flexible seal at the
bottom of the well. A gentle tug is all it takes. When the seal is
out, use a toothpick to remove leftover ingredients from around
the motor shaft and seal area. This area should be clean to allow the
seal to be replaced.

				10.

--------

SELF TEST

	If you experience problems that suggest your Breadmaker
could be faulty, the unit has a self test which will help you de-
termine what to do.

	When performing the self test, the most accurate results
are found when the unit has been cold for at least two hours.

	First, please remove the inner pot. This is done to save
the inner pot and will not affect the outcome of the test. Now,
please follow these steps:

	1) Unplug the breadmaker.

	2) Press the "CLOCK" button* and "CLEAR" button on the
	   display area and place the plug into the electrical out-
	   let while continuing to press the buttons.

		A display of "8:8" ("12:12" on some models)
	should show on the LED. If not, go through steps 1 and 2
	again until this display is shown.

	3) Press the "CLEAR" button again. You should now see a
	   sequence of numbers begin to be displayed on the LED.
	   These numbers merely mean that the machine is going through
	   its test cycle... the numbers themselves aren't important
	   to observe.

				11.

--------

*NOTE: On some models there is no "CLOCK" button. Instead, press
"TIME OF DAY" Button.

	4) The test will take about 20 minutes. At the end of the
	   test, you should see a display of "E123" (on some models)
	   or "11:11" (on some models). Such display values indicate
	   that the machine is functioning properly.

	If you receive a message on the LED screen reading "E55",
	please try the following procedure.

		Look into the upper left hand side of the baking
	unit. You will see four screws and a metal heating sensor
	located between the top two screws. Please take a 2 inch
	by 6 inch strip of aluminum foil and drape it over this
	sensor, allowing the lid to hold it in place. Then repeat
	steps one through four.

		If any values other that the ones listed in step
	four (4) appear on the display, this means the machine
	failed one of the test cycles and needs repair. Please
	contact DAK's Technical Department for assistance (Toll
	Free 1-800-888-9818).

	[I tried this self test on my machine and got "8:8" as
	the initial value and "11:11" as the final value. Be
	aware that the machine will heat up for a while and then
	turn on the fan. The test took about 10 minutes for my
	machine. The machine remains in the test mode after the
	self test--pressing "CLEAR" brought up the "8:8" display
	and pressing it again seemed to start the test all over.
	I cycled power to it and then reset the clock. As far as
	I know, this self-test is only for the original DAK Auto-
	Bakery; I don't know if it works with the Turbo version
	or with WelBilt machines.]

Adapted from Madge Rosenberg's _The Best Low-Fat, No-Sugar Bread
Machine Cookbook Ever_.

The filling was supposed to be just plain potatoes, garlic and thyme
and rosemary, but my friend and I decided we were in the mood for
something more Indian.  More traditional folks might find that the
bread clashes with the filling -- but I thought it good anyway.  One
could leave the thyme and rosemary out of the dough, if you wanted.

Anyway, here's how to prepare them:

Place all dough ingredients in bread machine and process on dough
setting.  When done, flour a board and your hands and divide the dough
into 8 pieces.  Flatten each piece into a 6 inch circle, place several
tablespoons of filling in the center and pinch dough closed around it.
Place seam side down on nonstick baking pan (I dusted it with flour).
Let rise for 15 minutes.  Then bake for 30 minutes in preheated 400
degree F oven.  Should be golden brown when done.

Makes a very fluffy dough (since we used all white flour which was all
my friend had on hand -- the original recipe calls for 3/4 cup of the
flour to be replaced with 3/4 cup whole wheat flour).

Lightly spray a 9x5" loaf pan with Pam or use a non-stick loaf pan.

Combine flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.

In a large bowl, beat yogurt, brown sugar and molasses until smooth.
Add oats and mix well. Add flour and raisins to combine. The batter
(more like dough) is very dry and it takes a little work to mix in
all the flour.

Put in loaf pan and let rest for 20 minutes.

Bake for 45-55 minutes in a 350 degree oven until lightly browned and
edges have begun to pull away from the sides of the pan.

  1                     egg -- beaten with a few
  1              drops  water

Add ingredients except for egg wash to bread machine in the order
recommended by the manufacturer.

Set machine for dough cycle and start it. If you used extra-large or jumbo
eggs, you will most likely need to add flour. Watch as the machine kneads
the dough. If the dough does not form a ball but sticks to the sides of the
pan, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wait until each tablespoon is
kneaded in before adding more. When dough cycle ends, remove dough to
floured board and knead a few times with floured hands. Add only as much
flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking. Shape dough into a thick
rope, then coil into a flat round, like a cinnamon roll. Move to a greased
baking sheet. Brush generously with egg wash. Cover lightly with plastic
wrap and a towel, then let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30
minutes. Brush again with egg, then bake at 350 degrees until loaf is
golden brown top and bottom, 30-40 minutes. Makes 1 large loaf.

  5 1/2              C  All-Purpose Flour -- To 6 1/2 C
  1                  C  Quick-Cooking Oats
  2                Tsp  Salt
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast -- (Used 4 1/2 T)

  1                     Egg White
                        Oatmeal -- Topping

Combine water, honey and butter in small saucepan.  Heat over low heat until liquids are very warm (120 - 130 deg F).

Place 5 cups flour, oats, salt, and yeast in bowl.  Attach bowl and dough hook.  Turn to Speed 2 and mix 15 seconds.  Gradually add warm liquids to flour mixture, about 1 minute.  Add eggs and mix an additional minute.

Continuing on Speed 2, add remaining flour, 1/2 C at a time, until dough clings to hok and cleans sides of bowl.  Knead on Speed 2 for 2 minutes longer.

Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down and divide in half.  Shape each half into a loaf and place in a greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2" loaf pan.  Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Combine water and egg white.  Brush tops of loaves with mixture.  Sprinkle with oatmeal.  Bake at 375 deg F for 40 minutes.  Remove from pans immediately and cool on wire racks.

Very good.

Watch the initial kneading for a bit - I had to adjust a little to get a good
dough ball - I think because the oatmeal absorbs differently than the flour -
enjoy and thanks for all the great recipies!  Cherie

  2                     egg whites
                        (Original recipe called for -- 2 eggs)
                        -- or 1/4  cup  Egg Beaters
  1         tablespoon  Lighter Bake -- a substitute for
                        butter
                        (Original called for 2T butter)
  1 3/4           cups  bread flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole-wheat flour
  2          teaspoons  yeast
     1/3           cup  raisins
  1                     egg white -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for wash

Put all ingredients in bread pan except eggwhite wash according to manf.
directions.  Add raisins at the end of first kneading.  Watch for moisture
of dough ball, I had to add almost 1/4 cup more flour.  I think it depends
on which eggs etc. you use.  Set bread machine to dough setting.  Remove
dough and let rest 5 minutes.  On lightly floured surface cut the dough into
four equal pieces and then cut each one of those pieces into 4 more equal
pieces.  Shape each piece into a smooth ball.  Place buns on large cookie
sheet sprayed with Pam with at least an inch between buns.  Cover with a
dish cloth and let rise until almost doubled about 45-50 minutes.  Prepare
frosting if desired out of 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1/2 teas. vanilla
extract, and 3 T. milk.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and right beofre baking
brush each bun with the eggwhite wash and cut a small x on the top with a
sharp knife.  Bake 18-20  minutes until golden brown.  Remove from oven and
cool on wire racks.  When cool, pipe a frosting cross on top of each bun.
Makes 16 buns.

  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  milk -- for glazing
                        ***
                        --1 baking tray, greased -- (1 to 2)

These buns are very moist and light, packed with fruit and spice. They are
delicious freshly baked on Good Friday, then split, toasted and buttered
for the rest of the Easter weekend. If you do not eat the buns within 3
days, they will freeze up to one month.
You can replace a proportion of the white flour with stoneground wholemeal
flour.

Ingredients - 24 buns

Preheat the oven to its lowest setting. Mix the flour, salt, mixed spice,
sugar and mixed dried fruit together in a large mixing bowl and make a well
in the centre. Put the bowl in the oven to warm the ingredients while you
prepare the yeast.
Crumble the yeast in a small bowl. Cream it into a smooth liquid with the
milk powder and water. Add the butter or margarine and stir until melted.
Pour the yeast liquid into the well in the warmed flour mixture. Add the
eggs and mix the ingredients together in the well. Gradually work in the
flour to make a very soft but not sticky dough. If the dough appears too
dry, work in a little extra water, 1 tablespoon at a time. If it is too
sticky, work in a little extra flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Turn out the dough on to a lightly floured work surface abd knead for
10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Return the dough to the bowl, cover
with a damp teatowel and leave to rise at warm room temperature until
doubled in size, 30 minutes - 1 hour.
Knock back the risen dough. Trun out on to a lightly floured work surface
and knead gently for 5 minutes until very smooth and elastic. Divide the
mixture in 24 equal portions, then shape into neat rolls.
Arrange fairly close, but not touching, on the baking tray. Cover with a
damp teatowel and leave to rise at warm room temperature until the buns
are almost doubled in size and have joined up, 30 - 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 250C (500F, Gas 10).
While the buns are rising, make the topping. Mix the flour and sugar
with 4 tablespoons water to make a thick, smooth paste. Spoon into a
piping bag fitted with a small, plain tube.
With the back of a knife, mark a cross on the top of each bun, then brush
with the egg glaze. Pipe a cross of flour paste in the indentations on
each bun.
Put the tray into the oven, then immediately lower the oven temperature
to 200C (400F, Gas 6) and bake for 15 - 20 minutes until the buns are
golden brown and sound hollow when tapped underneath. Transfer to a wire
rack to cool. When the buns are completely cool, pull them apart.

To use dried yeast granules: reconstitute 2 sachets (14 gram / 0.5 oz)
with 140 ml (5 fl. oz) of the lukewarm water and 2 teaspoons of the
sugar. Add the milk powder and remaining water. Proceed with the recipe.

To use easy-blend dried yeast: mix 2 sachets (14 gram / 0.5 oz) with the
flour mixture before it is warmed. Proceed with the recipe, adding all
the water at once.

I set my machine for white manual. When it beeps at completion I
sometimes let it sit for a little while. But I usually just take the
whole thing out and divide into 8 pieces. Then shape into whatever shape
you want. Place buns on a slightly greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise
until approximately double.
 Bake at 450 for 10 minutes, then lower temperature to 350 and bake for
another 10 minutes.

Before baking you can sprinkle sesame or poppy seeds on top.
These are tasty.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           Packages  Active dry yeast
  1         Tablespoon  Granulated sugar
     1/4           Cup  Water -- very warm
     1/4           Cup  Butter -- cut into small piece
  2               Cups  Milk -- warm
  6               Cups  Flour -- all-purpose
  1           Teaspoon  Salt
     1/4           Cup  Butter -- melted

1. In a large bowl sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water (should feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist) and allow to stand until bubbly, about 10 minutes.

2. Combine butter and milk in top of double boiler over simmering water until butter has melted and milk is warm. Add to yeast mixture and stir until blended. Mix in 2 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, and beat well to form a spongy dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Stir down with wooden spoon, then add about 3 more cups of flour to form a moist dough that is firm enough to turn out onto a well-floured board.

3. Dip hands in flour and knead dough until smooth and nonsticky, adding additional flour as needed. The dough should be velvety-smooth.

4. Form into a ball and place in a well-buttered, warm mixing bowl. Turn ball of dough so that entire surface of dough is coated with softened butter. Cover and again place in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 hour.

5. Punch dough down, turn out onto a lightly floured board, and let rest for about 5 minutes.

6. Roll out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch cut with a floured knife first into approximate 2-inch squares, then into triangles. Roll up from wide side to point and place on baking sheet about 1/4 inch apart. When all are prepared, brush with melted butter and again let rise until about double in bulk, about 30 minutes.

7. Bake in a preheated 350F. oven until lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on size. To test for doneness gently tap top of roll for a hollow sound or break open one roll to see if it is sufficiently baked in the center.

                        How To Make A Proofing Box

To make the "Proofing Box":

Quoting "Worldwide Sourdoughs From Your Bread Machine" by Donna Rathmell
German and Ed Wood, "To really make a sourdough sing, it needs a warm
environment after it comes out of the refrigerator.  The ideal is 85 to 95
degrees . . . The best solution is to fashion a 'proofing box'.  Seek out an
ordinary styrofoam cooler, the bigger the better.  Throw away the top, turn
it upside down and cut a hole in the middle of the bottom just big enough to
admit a standard light socket.  A
25-watt bulb should maintain the correct temperature.  If you want to get
fancy, put a light dimmer switch on the cord and you can regulate the
temperature precisely."

        Now, I use my proofing box to rise the dough once I have formed it
into a loaf and put it in a pan.  Check the loaf every half hour or so, as
it may over-rise and drip down the side of the pan.  Yes, I've had LOTS of
experience with this.  You want it to be a nice round dome when you bake it
(in the oven).  I bought a light socket already wired to a cord and plug at
a hardware store.  It even has a dimmer switch already installed.  This
works well for me.  Good luck, and let me know how it works for you!

Soak rice in water for 2-3 hours, keep a little bit of water, and drain away
the excess, put the rice and water in a blender, blend for a while,(or stone
grind it), pour the grinded rice inside a cloth bag, put the bag in a seive
or on something with holes so that the water can be drained away, put
something heavy on top of the bag to help draining out the water for a few
hours.

What is left inside the bag is rice flour, if you are not using it
immediately, you will need to dry it before keeping.

In using compressed yeast you may use double or even tripple the quantity of yeast given in your recipe in order to shorten time of fermentation.Be sure not to let your dough get too light at any stage of the procedure.

(In other words, don't let the dough go for too long a rise.  If you use this procedure and watch your dough texture/height, there is no reason why this should not work, and want the joy of doing it yourself.)

I don't like a sour white bread, so a longer rise with less yeast is OK.
Julia Childs "Best Chefs" series made a bread which looked like this one,
raised in a basket, filled with olives.  VERY slow rise. Crusty and fluffy
inside.  However this one is soft inside, and somewhat dense, like a
bagel. a Montreal Bagel.

I now use my Cuisinart(extra large), with the regular knife blade. It's
tricky, but once you find the correct consistency, it only takes 1-2
minutes to knead the dough. Over heating the dough can occur if left to
knead much longer.

I haven't tried it with whole grains. Mostly to make the softer doughs,
egg bread ( Challah ), pizza, french bread, potato/corn meal.  The
advantages are that if I'm having a pizza party I can whip up tons of
dough in a few minutes or make a party/dip loaf.

I've also taken to producing huge crusty loaves with raggety tops. I smear
the insides with some oil, cover with loose plastic wrap and close machine.

Hitting the pulse switch to punch it down.

The dough rises in the food processor, blade and all. Then dump the rough
mass onto corn meal, or sesame seeds. Gently remove blade from top of
mass. Pinch together the top here and there. Spray with water or dust with
flour, bake at 450 F for 30 min. reduce to 350 for 20 min. or until it
'clunks'.

450 F  yield: 2/4x8 loaves (appx)
1/ 15x7"loaf

Pizza, Focaccia, Flat, and Filled Breads From Your Bread Machine - Perfect Every Time  by Lora Brody.

These hearty muffins are slillet-baked and then toasted like English muffin.  Or if you prefer, you can bake them in the oven with an egg glaze to get puffy little breads with crispy crusts.  The whole wheat dough is flavored with allspice, molasses, and sherry-soaked raisins and currants.  They are fabulous slathered with butter.

Skillet-baked muffins will keep for several days, stored after cooling in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.  To freeze them, keep them tightly wrapped in a plastic bag.

Oven-baked muffins will keep for two days, tightly wrapped in plastic.  They may be frozen, tightly wrapped.  Reheat them in a toaster oven to retain the crispy crusts; do not microwave them.

For the dough:
Soak the currants and raisins in the sherry overnight or microwave them in a tightly covered contain for 2 minutes.

Place all the ingredients except the currants, raisins, and sherry in the machine, program for Dough, Basic Dough, or Manual, and press Start.  The dough will be sticky during the first part of the kneading cycle.  At the end of the final cycle, add the raisins, restart the machine, and allow it to knead just until the fruit is mixed in.

To finish the muffins:
Roll the dough out on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/2 inch.  Flour the rolling pin as necessary to keep the dough from sticking.  Cut rounds with a 3 inch floured cutter.  You can use a tuna fish can as a cutter if you cut off both ends.  Sprinkle a baking sheet with the cornmeal and arrange the cut muffins 1 1/2 inches apart on the baking sheet.

To bake in a skillet:
Cover the muffins with plastic wrap and let them rise in a warm place for 1 hour.  Preheat an electric skillet to 250 deg F and oil it or spray it lightly with nonstick vegetable spray.  Place the muffins in the skillet with the cornmeal side down.  You can probably cook 4 - 8 at a time depending on the size of your skillet.  Leave room for them to be turned easily.

Cook the muffins for 10 min, or until they are deep golden brown on the bottom.  Turn the muffins and continue baking for another 10 minutes.  Cool the muffins on wire racks.  Split them and toast them like English muffins.

To bake in Oven:
Form the muffins as above, but only allow them to rise while the oven preheats to 350 deg F with the rack in the center position.  They do not need longer than a 10 - 15 min rising time for they will rise in the oven.  Generously brush the egg glaze over the muffins. Sprinkle with the sugar and bake for 15 - 20 minutes or until slightly browned.

These are **really** good and Jeff and I recommend them!!

  To make mix, combine all ingredients in plastic bag
  except lemon zest. Add zest and shake bag well. Seal
  and set aside until needed. To make 1 loaf: sprinkle
  yeast over warm water and let foam for 5 minutes.
  Place 2 cups of well shaken mix into a large bowl with
  the milk, butter and yeat mixture and beat with an
  electric mixer until well blended. Cover bowl and let
  mixture rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Then
  place two more cups of mix onto the surface of dough
  in bowl. Beat until well blended again with mixer or
  by hand. Place a little flour on work surface and mix
  in the raisins and currants. Incorporate this into the
  dough and knead until smooth and elastic, adding
  additional flour to make a fairly stiff but pliable
  dough. Place dough in a large grerased bowl and turn
  to coat. Cover and let dough rise double in bulk,
  about 1 to 2 hours. Punch down and knead into a round
  loaf. Place on baking sheet and allow to rise double
  in bulk. Bake in a 350 oven until done, about 50
  minutes. Makes 1 large loaf.

slices and use as a base for eggs Benedict or rub with olive oil, cut into
fingers, toast, and you will have a rustic, portable hors d'oeuvre.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.  Let the loaf cool before slicing.

     1/4            T.  sugar
     1/8            T.  salt


The following is an outstanding recipe for Focaccia from Red Star yeast.  The
first time I made it, I served it with steaming bowls of seasoned pinto beans
and it was great.  Enjoy.

In large mixer bowl, combine 1 1/2 c. flour, yeast, 1 T. sugar and 1 t. salt;
mix well. Add water and oil to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until
moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, gradually stir in enough
remaining flour to make a firm dough. Knead on floured surface 5 to 8 minutes,
adding flour as needed. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover;
let rise in warm place about 40 minutes (20 minutes for Quick Rise yeast).

Prepare onion topping. In small skillet, saute onion in butter until soft. Stir
in 1/3 t. sugar and 1/8 t. salt.

Punch down dough. On lightly floured surface, shape dough into a ball. Place on
greased cookie sheet. Flatten to a 10-inch circle. With table knife, cut a
circle in dough about 1 inch from edge, cutting almost through to cookie sheet.
Prick center with a fork. Spread Onion Topping over the pricked dough. Cover;
let rise in warm place about 30 minutes (15 minutes for Quick Rise). Bake at
375 deg. for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.

Variation. Omit Onion Topping. Instead of pricking top, cut a criss-cross
design with a sharp knife. Brush bread with an egg glaze made by combining 1
egg yolk and 1 T. milk or water. Sprinkle with sesame seed if desired.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Pkg  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           Cups  Rolled Oats -- Quick
  2 1/2           Cups  Bread Flour -- ** I Use 3 Cups+
  1                Cup  oat bran
     1/2           Cup  nonfat dry milk

  1                Tsp  salt
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  oil
  2 1/2           Cups  warm water

Add ingredients as manufacture instructs and push start for regular bread
mode.
Best served warm but wonderful toasted when cold
Note: Jeff also has put in chunks of meat or cheese, or even cinnamon and
raisins for variations.
** I find his dough much to wet! I use 3 cups+ of bread flour.  I've tried
reducing the water with the 2 1/2 cups flour but the loaf is then much
smaller. So I opt to go and add the flour.
This is really a delicious loaf when freshly baked.

*NOTE( I chop it by hand with a sharp knife )it shouldn't be a puree, I usually do a fine julliene cut

This is quite an agreeable recipe in flavor and a good way to use up extra
lettuce. I dont reccommend the bitter kind of lettuce though.Besides
homegrown garden lettuce, Ive even used storebought iceberg!

Yield: 2, 8 x 4 loaves

Beat sugar and oil and beat in eggs and lemon juice. sift dry ingredients
and add to first mixture. Stir in the lettuce and nuts. Pour into greased 8
x 4 loaf pans. Bake in a preheated 350 oven about 50 minutes or tested done.
Bread freezes very well.

  2 2/3           Cups  bread flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  yeast

*NOTE (D.R. German says a rounded 1/4 tsp= 1/3tsp.)

**NOTE You can find Kashi in a natural foods store or in the cereal section of some grocery stores.  I'm pretty sure that you'll be able to buy Kashi wherever you buy rice dream.  It is a combination of 7 grain berries.  Make sure you get the "breakfast pilaf" which requires cooking. Use 2 parts water to 1 part kashi and cook, covered, for 30 min.  The directions are on the box.  Make it for the softer version because even cooking it that way, the wheat berries are very noticeable in the bread.

variation of one of Donna Rathmell German's from her book,_The Bread Machine Cookbook_.

The original recipe calls for water and I have substituted soy milk and rice dream  and the results were great.

The texture of the bread might have been a little finer, but not much. Also, I never use butter or margarine anymore.  I use olive oil most of the time or canola.  The results are equally good.  I'll type her original recipe and put my substitutions in parentheses.

Kashi Breakfast Pilaf is a specially formulated pure blend of whole oats,
long grain brown rice, whole rye, triticale, hard red winter wheat, raw
buckwheat, barley, and mechanically dehulled sesame seeds. This blend
creates a complete protein food with a high concentration of complex
carbohydrates and fiber. It lends a wonderful chewy texture to this bread.

1       Combine Kashi and water in small saucepan and simmer, covered, 15
minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 30 minutes.
2       Place Kashi in small strainer on top of measuring cup and press
down with back of spoon to drain thoroughly; reserve cooking liquid.
3       Place cooked Kashi and all remaining ingredients in pan of bread
machine in order listed, or in the order recommended for your machine.
4       Set controls for Basic bread with medium crust and start machine.

Makes one 1 1/2-pound loaf.

VARIATION: Omit the herbs and use a milder flavored oil instead of the
olive oil, for a bread that tastes great with your favorite fruit spread.

Combine milk, sugar, salt and butter in small saucepan.  Heat over low heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves.  Cool to lukewarm.

Dissolve yeast in warm water in warmed bowl.  Add lukewarm milk mixture and 4 1/2 C flour.  Attach bowl and dough hook.  Turn to Speed 2 and mix 1 minute.  Continuing on Speed 2, add remaining flour, 1/2 C at a time, until dough clings to hook and cleans sides of bowl.  Knead on Speed 2 for 2 minutes longer, or until dough is smooth and elastic.  Dough will be slightly sticky to the touch.

Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hr.

Punch dough down and divide in half.  Shape each half into a loaf and place in greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2" loaf pan.  Cover; let rise in warm place free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hr.

Bake at 400 deg F for 30 minutes.  Remove from pans immediately and cool on wire racks.

                        Lactose Sugar Information

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                  ****


	LACTOSE SUGAR

Lactose sugar or whey powder is a bi-product of milk, which makes your
baking & cooking more nutritional.  Why powder is composed of
approximately 75% lactose; and approximately 14% protein, & also
contains 115 other vitamins and minerals.

Whey Powder is also much more economical than glucose sugar, and Whey
Powder has been used as a sugar replacer in the large bakeries for a
quarter of a century.

	HINTS

	When the recipe calls for both brown & white sugar, use the
same amount of brown, but substitute the white sugar with the same
amount of whey powder.

	When the recipe calls for just white sugar, sue 2 parts whey
powder to 1 part sugar.  Example: 1 cup sugar; changes to 2/3 cup whey
powder, 1/3 cup sugar.

	When dealing in fourths use 1/2 whey powder & 1/4 sugar.

	Baked goods have a tendency to brown quicker on the bottom,
when baking with whey powder, so set your racks higher than usual in
your oven.  Put them on the upper half of the oven.

	Use only in recipes which can have other milk products in it.

	Whey powder cannot be substituted for sugar in things like
divinity.  They whey powder will caramelize in the syrup.

	Whey powder does not work well as a powdered sugar replacement
or as a coffee creamer.

	Do not set your oven higher than 375.  350 is the usual
cooking degrees to use for cookies and brownies or cakes.  Rolls may
be cooked at 375, but they will brown faster then without using whey
powder.

	Remember that whey powder is a milk product, when you are
deciding to use it on, or in something.

	Whey powder can be used half and half with sugar on cereals
and improve its nutrition.

	It also works well in a half and half mixture with skim milk,
as a beverage.

These helpful hints were written and compiled by Dairy Distributors,
Inc., dba Gossner's Cheese Company, 10th North and 10th West, Logan,
UT 84321.

I shall be sending to everyone some recipes that call for whey powder.
The ones I have tried are wonderful.  They are simple, easy to
substitute recipes.  I think you will enjoy!

* You are not cooking the cornmeal, just softening it up.You dont want to kill the yeast with overly hot water either.
In a large bowl place cornmeal and add water and stir to combine. Let soak 5 minutes. Mix in the salt, yeast and molasses and mix well. Start adding and stirrring 2 cups of flour at a time until the mixture leaves the sides of
the bowl and forms a dough. Place in a large greased bowl and cover and let dough rest &rise about an hour in a warm place.
 Turn dough out of bowl and now knead smooth and elastic on a floured surface. Portion out dough into equal amounts  for several loaves ( 3 to 5 ).
 Form & fold into loaf shape and place in greased bread pans ( size wasn't specified  but as a rule it should fill at least 1/2 full ) .Brush top of dough with soft butter and let dough rise light to tops of pans. bake
loaves in a preheated 400 degree oven about 30 to 45 minutes or until browned and tested done. Remove from pans to let cool on racks.Freeze when cool.

Dough:
Add to your bread machine in the order given, program for knead and
first rise and press start, Meanwhile prepare the filling.  At the end
of the cycle remove the dough and proceed with completing the pastries.

To make the filling - either by hand or in a food processor combine all
ingredients except the confectioners sugar- mix until smooth.
Lightly grease 2 heavy duty cookie sheets. Place the dough on a lightly
floured work surface.  Cut the dough into 4 pieces and working one piece
at a time, and using as little additional flour as possible, roll it out
into a 12 x 8 inch rectangle. Use a long sharp knife or pastry wheel to
cut this into six 4  inch squares.  Place a heaping tablespoon of the
filling in the centre of each square. Bring one side over to form a
rectangle and pinch the edges to seal them closed. Place the pastries 2
inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.
 Allow the pastries to rise, uncovered in a warm draft-free place until
doubled in bulk.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees f. with the rack in
the centre position. Bake the pastries for 15 to 18 minutes or until the
tops are puffed and golden.  transfer them with a metal spatula to a
rack to cool.  Just before serving dust with the confectioners sugar.

                             Lavender Sweet Cheese Pastries
The marrying of the flowers and cheeses of provence in a sweet pastry
turns out to be a joyous combination. The delicate sweet scent of
lavender forms the perfect backdrop for the honey sweetened goat cheese
filling. Dreid lavender flowers are available in most health food
stores. These are the ones to look for - not the artificially scented
types used in potpurri.  Make sure to select a mild, neither aged nor
spiced goat cheese.
The inspiration for this recipe came from Beth Hensperger's wonderful
book , Bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast -- (1 pkg)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  warm water
  15              cups  white flour -- unbleached
  4 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  5               cups  warm water
                        --for more nutritious bread, add:
                        -- 1 1/2 cups nonfat dry milk to water
                        --and beat well
  3        tablespoons  olive oil


Proof the yeast by dissolving the yeast & sugar in 1 cup lukewarm water for
5 to 10 minutes.

Mix 14 cups flour and salt together in a large bowl, reserving 1 cup flour
for kneading.  Add 5 cups lukewarm water, oil, and the yeast mixture all at
once to flour.  Stir with wooden spoon or with hands until dough sticks
together.  Turn out onto a floured board or cloth and knead very well.
Gradually add the reserved flour to keep dough from sticking.  Kneading may
take 10 to 15 minutes.  Dough is ready when it feels elastic; bubbles will
break on the surface when you form it into a ball.

Place in a greased bowl and cover with a dry cloth.  let dough rise in a
warm place, undisturbed, until it doubles in size (about 2 hours).  Punch
dough down.  Oil hands and divide dough into 25 to 30 balls the size of
small oranges.  Again, cover them with a dry cloth and place in a warm spot
to rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  if you have an electric oven, set it to broil
at 450 degrees, placing a baking sheet on the lowest rack.  then turn a
Chinese wok upside down so it rests on the baking sheet.  For a gas oven,
place an upside-down wok on the floor of the oven.

Combine 3/4 cup cornmeal with the same amount of flour.  Flatten each ball
of dough and dip both sides in the cornmeal mixture.  Place them like
pancakes in a stack, separating them with wax paper.  Make five piles of 6
each (more than 6 may cause the piles to topple over).  Cover all the stacks
with a cloth so they don't dry out.

Roll out each pancake until it is as thin and round as possible.  Then pick
up dough and begin to stretch it by flipping it back & forth between your
hands.  A pizza technique of throwing it up in the air, catching it, and
flattening the edges of the circle with your thumb and forefinger works
fine.  Good luck!

Make a fist with one hand and place dough on top of fist.  Then turn dough
in circles with other hand, pulling on edges so they get as thin as
possible.  The shape will be an irregular 14 to 16 inch circle unless you
are a wizard at circles.

Drape dough on top of hot wok.  Bake 30 to 60 seconds, until lightly
browned and bubbly.  Peel off and place on baking sheet.  Run under broiler
for 5 to 10 seconds until dark brown.

Remove to board, spray with water (see Note) and cover with damp cloth.
Stack new breads on top of old ones.  Cover finished stack with damp tea
towels.  When bread is pliable (after 2-3 hours), fold each in quarters and
package in plastic.

NOTE:  Traditionally the bread is not dampened at all.  Thin spots are
crisp and brittle.  Finished breads are simply stacked on top of each other.
We recommend dampening the bread because we discovered we preferred it
pliable, it kept better, and it was also easier to store.

                International Breads            Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  sour milk -- or buttermilk
     1/4           Cup  sugar
  6        Tablespoons  corn syrup
     1/2      Teaspoon  baking soda
     1/8      Teaspoon  cardamom
  3 1/2           Cups  all-purpose flour

Combine the ingredients and work the mixture with the hands, or in an electric mixer with a dough hook, to make a soft, pliable dough.  Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece about 1/8 inch thick into a square, oblong, or circle.  Cut into squares or circles with a 4-6 inch cutter.  Bake on a lightly floured griddle, over quite low heat, 12-15 minutes one each side.  The lefse should color very slightly.

NOTES : "Lefse is a rather unusual flatbread of Scandinavian origin, and there are many different recipes for it. It can be eaten warm or cold.  When cold, it grows quite firm and crisp, but it is traditionally dipped lightly into water and softened before being rolled with a filling or simply spread with butter. When it is eaten warm, it should be taken from the griddle, folded into a napkin, and served with butter, cheeses, preserves, or other fillings.  In either case, it is easy to prepare and delightful to eat."

If it is not to be eaten warm, lefse should be stored in a tin or a box, where it will become crisp.

                Hand Made                       International Breads
                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               Cups  Potatoes -- Riced Or Mashed Salt
                        (Not Packaged  Potato Buds)
  1 1/2           Cups  Flour -- (No More)
  2                 T.  melted butter
  2                 T.  Shortening -- Melted


Regarding LEFSE: I am 100% Norwegian and grew up on lefse. In the midwest it
was made by sweet little ladies who packaged it at home and sold it by word
of mouth or in  smaller markets. Several members of my family could make it
and I fortunately have a very good recipe from a cousin. It takes practice
and patience but it is well worth the effort.

Add the shortening and butter to the potatoes FIRST. You do not want to add
too much flour, barely 11/2 cups total, so I usually add  about half that and
use the rest to roll it out as that is the most difficult part.  Work into a
smooth dough and divide into balls about golfball size. (This depends on the
size of lefse you want.) Keep the balls in the refrigerator while rolling
dough because it rolls better if cool. Cool the balls for at least an hour
before you start rolling them.

The rolling is the tough part. As I said, keep the dough cool, flour the
board well and roll the balls out as thin as you can. You need to be fast .
Some people use a floured cloth on which to roll. You can buy long wooden
paddles to transer the "crepe" to a griddle. At any rate,transfer the "crepe"
to a hot griddle--teflon helps. Cook at about 425 until it begins to bubble,
turn and cook until it bubbles up from the griddle.Remove and let cool.

It really takes a lot of practice to make lefse. It ends up to look a lot
like a tortilla but that is where the likeness stops. Lefse is used  much
like bread. It is buttered and rolled up and eaten with the meal. Another way
is to put butter and  mayonnaise on it, roll it around meat and eat it like a
 burrito.

Good luck!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               Cups  Russet Potatoes
     1/2           Cup  Heavy Cream
  8               Tbls  Butter -- Or Oleo
  1                Tbl  Salt
  1                Tbl  Sugar -- (About)
  3 1/2           Cups  Flour -- * add 1 C/see below

Rice POTATOES while hot.
Add CREAM, melted BUTTER,
SALT, and SUGAR.
Cool to room temperature.
Refrig overnight
Add 1 C.* Flour to 1/2 the Potato mixture
Knead together well.

After rolling/baking 1st half,
Do the same to the saved 2nd half
Add 1* Cup of the FLOUR to it
Use remaining* FLOUR for rolling lefse.
Don't use too much FLOUR for rolling.
Roll mixture into thin pieces
Bake on Lefse Grill

**I think the "sugar" in the recipe is what makes it successful.
I seems to be the one ingredient that isn't found in a hundred other
similar lefse recipes. It rolls like a dream... As you know it isn't easy
to roll up "mashed potatoes" without having them fall apart!

I taught Lefse Making for years,
but my very favorite of all was this one: [Bev]

                        -- 1 1/2 Lb Loaf:
  1            Package  yeast
  3               Cups  bread flour
     1/4           Cup  sugar

  1                     egg
  2          Teaspoons  lemon rind -- dried, grated
     1/2      Teaspoon  lemon extract
  7                 Oz  lemonade -- *
     1/4           Cup  water -- very hot
  2          Teaspoons  Poppy Seeds

Throw everything in and press play.  I use the white bread setting.

As far as I know, this is an original.  It's sized for a 1.5 pound
(R2D2-style) Welbilt.

* I know that 7 oz is a weird measurement, but it seems to be what
works.  If I use a full cup, then it comes out very gooey, and 3/4 cup
is a little too dry.  Also, I make this with refrigerated lemonade and
the hottest tap water I can get, but I always use the timer.  The
proper way to do it would be to heat the lemonade and water to 130oF
or so.

"Sweet, but not cloying, and slightly tart, this is good beach food

before you leave home, there will be no paper or plastic wrapper
to add to the trash on the beach. Just shake out the crumbs before
you dry off."

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.

My favorite recipe is from Bread Machine Magic by Linda Rehberg &
Lois Conway.  Adapted for vegans (and allergic people)

Bake on light crust.

I hope it was ok to post this.  In general I just substitute the soy
milk powder for milk.  I've also made the Basic Sweet Roll dough
very successfully (great Jim's Cinnamon Rolls!).

Linda & Lois's other book (whose name I don't have quite right), it's
something like Bread Machine Magic Hints and was just reissued with
even more hints, talks about substitutions for allergies, special
diets, etc.

Note:  In the Zojirushi, the authors had better results when they
baked it on the Regular cycle rather than the French Bread cycle.

1.  Place all ingredients in bread pan and press Start.
2.  After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on
cake rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

In the book, the authors also included instructions for making the
dough in the machine, and then shape and bake the dough in the oven.
I have always let the machine do the whole job.  It turns out just
fine.

 On Vacation I always stop at bakeries; so...
  Everytime I visit Provincetown Mass. I always stop by one of the oldest
  Portugese bakeries on the main street. As I peek in the window, there
  stands an elderly woman, pulling pieces of  dough from a hugh vat and
  frying the stretched out dough in another hugh pot of
  hot oil. When they are golden and puffed she shakes some
  promptly  with sugar. The aroma is heavenly and it is hard to resist
  buying them.
  Once in a great while I do prepare these treats. make sure your oil is
  hot enough for deep frying ( 360 to 375 degrees ) and drain on a brown
  paper bag or  toweling to blot any excess oil.

   Place flour in a large bowl. add all remaining ingredients and mix to
   form a soft dough, knead smooth and elastic. Add more flour or liquid
   as required for proper dough consisitency.Cover and let rise double in
   a warm place.Punch down and let rise again. Pull off pieces of the
   dough,( as large as you wish making sure it fits in the frying vessel,
   giving room for it to puff and turn,) stretching
   it and set aside for 10 minutes. Fry in hot oil and turn only once. Each
   side should be golden. Drain on paper towels or on brown bags. May be
   eaten with butter and maple syrup for breakfast or roll in sugar and
   eat as a treat.
   Note: if you dont wish to go through all this trouble you can use
   thawed frozen white bread dough or make your own dough in the abm for
   either a white bread or sweet egg dough .
   There are many variations on this recipe. Some use many eggs which is
   common in Portuguese baking, and others use a leaner dough for the
   fried dough.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2              C  All-Purpose Flour -- + Extra For Board
  2                Tsp  salt
  1                  C  Milk -- Warm To 110 Deg F
     1/3             C  Water -- + 2 T, 110 Deg F
  2                 Tb  butter -- melted
  3                 Tb  honey
  1                Pkg  Yeast -- Rapid-Rise


(Food Processor Version)

1. Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Once
oven temperature reaches 200 degrees, maintain heat 10 minutes, then
turn off oven heat.

2. Mix flour and salt in bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade.
Add liquid ingredients; process until rough ball forms. Let dough rest 2
minutes. Process 35 seconds. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and
knead by hand, adding a little more flour if needed, until dough is
smooth and satiny, 4 to 5 minutes.

3. Place dough in very lightly oiled bowl, rubbing dough around bowl to
lightly coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; place in warm oven until
dough doubles in size, 40 to 50 minutes.

4. Form dough into loaf (there's an illustration, but I can't reproduce
it here - sorry), placing in greased 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan.

5. Cover with plastic wrap; set aside in warm spot until dough almost
doubles in size, 20 to 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees, placing
empty loaf pan on bottom rack. Bring 2 C water to boil.

6. Remove plastic wrap from loaf pan. Place pan in oven, immediately
pouring boiling water in empty loaf pan; (again, I can't put the
illustration here.....) close oven door. Bake until instant-read
thermometer inserted at an angle from short end just above pan rim into
center of loaf reaches 195 degrees, about 40 to 50 minutes. Remove bread
from pan, transfer to a wire rack, and cool to room temperature. Slice
and serve.

A few variation:

Whole wheat: Substitute 1 1/3 C whole wheat flour for 1 1/3 C
all-purpose flour. Increase first first to 50 to 60 minutes, and second
rise to 40 minutes.

Oatmeal: Bring 3/4 C water to boil in small saucepan. Add 3/4 C rolled
oats; cook to soften slightly, about 90 seconds. Follow above recipe,
decreasing flour from 3 1/2 C to 2 3/4 C, adding the cooked oatmeal to
flour and omitting the warm water from the wet ingredients.

Cornmeal: Bring 1/2 C water to boil in small saucepan. Slowly whisk in
1/4 C cornmeal. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, about
1 minutes. Follow above recipe, decreasing flour to 3 1//4 C, decreasing
milk to 3/4 C, and adding cornmeal mixture to flour (before
incorporating liquids).

Anadama: Follow cornmeal loaf recipe, substituting molasses for honey.

Now, then, I tried to master recipe (white bread) over the last weekend,
and found that it turned out a wonderful tasting loaf, but the crust
turned out much too chewy for me. I will try it next week, brushing the
crust with butter to see if that makes a difference. The magazine
article deals with trying to recreate American sandwich bread, but I
don't think this quite succeeds. It is, however, a nice bread made with
minimal effort and no bread machine. (I love my bread machine, but
slicing those cylindrical loaves is maddening sometimes.....)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  whole wheat flour -- bread
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (1 1/4 to 1 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  blackstrap molasses
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2           cup  warm water
     1/4      teaspoon  honey
  2          teaspoons  yeast

Mix the last three ingredients in a measuring cup, let sit for a
couple minutes, then pour into the flour.  Put the honey and molasses
into the same cup, add 1 cup water, stir it to dissolve, then pour it
into the flour.

Mix the dough, adding the remaining 1/4-1/2 cup of water as necessary
to get all the flour into the dough.  When the dough is ready to start
kneeding, put 3 cups of water in a large glass jar or bowl, and put in
the microwave for 6-8 minutes on HIGH until it begins to boil.  (The
water, according to my microwave book, acts as a heat absorber and
moderator.  I never tried making bread without it, so it may or may
not be necessary.)  While the water is heating, kneed the dough.  (I
use an extra-large stainless steel mixing bowl to make bread, so I
just kneed the dough in the same bowl I used to mix it.  Makes clean
up a snap.)  Kneed for about 8 minutes, or until the water is boiling.

**Very** lightly grease two 6-cup microwave bowls with vegetable oil.
Cut the dough into two pieces, form these pieces into balls by turning
the sides down and under, "twist" the bottom of the balls closed, and
put the two balls into the two bowls, twist side down.  Put the bowls
of dough into your microwave along with the jar of boiled water and
microwave on the low power setting (i.e., "1" or "10") for 20-25
minutes to let the dough rise.  The dough will approximately double in
size.  Don't "punch it down" or kneed it a second time--just microwave
on HIGH for 10 minutes to "bake" it.  (I do this all at one time by
programming my microwave to cook at "10" for 18 minutes, then "HIGH"
for 10 minutes.)  After "baking", remove the bread by simply turning
the bowls upside down and shaking out the bread.  You'll have two
small round loaves when done.

The final product:  The crust of the bread will be softer than a
traditionally-baked loaf, since the microwave doesn't dry it out and
brown it like a traditional oven.  Also, the surface of the loaf will
be lighter (the whole wheat flour and molasses give the bread a nice
light brown appearance).  The inside of the bread of the loaf will be
nice and moist, with a good crumb structure.  (I'm munching on some
right now that I just pulled out of the microwave :-) ).  The bottom
of the loaves tend to be a little bit soggy, but not bad at all.

You may have to adjust cooking times to fit the size and power of your
microwave.  Mine is a 600 W, 0.8 cu. ft. Magic Chef.

You can defrost frozen bread dough and even speed up bread rising in the
microwave if you follow these steps:

For defrosting:
Place bread on a microwaveable plate. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave
on high for 25 seconds. Turn over, rotate plate 1/2 turn and microwave on
high for another 25 seconds. Then put into your baking pan that has been
sprayed with non-stick cooking spray and let rise for 1 to 2 hours. It may be
faster to put the frozen dough in the baking pan which has been sprayed with
a non-stick cooking product. Don't wrap dough with plastic wrap. Preheat oven
to 200 F, then turn off. Boil 1 or 2 quarts of water in a shall pan. Place
rolls in oven with the pan of sater. Let dough rise about 1 hour, until
doubled in size. Watch closely so dough doesn't rise too high. Remove water
and then bake bread.

Or. . . wrap frozen bread dough in waxed paper and set in microwave. Set
machine to defrost for 6 to 7 minutes for a 1 lb. loaf of bread. Then allow
to rise and bake in a conventional oven.

Or. . . boil 4 cups water. Place boiled water in microwave with frozen bread
which has been placed in a glass loaf pan. Microwave on high 1/2 minutes;
rest 20 minutes. Repeat 3 times, rotating dish 1/4 turn with each heating.
Rest in microwave until duble in size (15 to 20) minutes. (Reheat water if it
cools) Cook in conventional oven following directions of your recipe.

Or. . . place frozen bread dough in a greased 9x5x3-inch glass loaf pan
placed in 1 cup boiling water bath in a 12x8-inch glass dish. Microwave on
medium (50%), covered with wax paper, 4 to 5 m;inutes, rotating 1/4 turn
every minute and turning dough over halfway through cooking. Rest 10 minutes
in water bath. Bake as desired.

To speed up bread rising:
Fill 4 cup glass measure with 3 cups water. Microwave on high for 6 to 8
minutes to boil. Place dough in glass bowl. Place dough dish in 12x8 inch
glass dish filled with boiling water. Microwave low (10%), covered, 12 to 15
minutes until double in size. Punch down. Repeat. Transfer dough to glass
loaf pan. Repeat until double in size.

     1/2           Cup  Raisins -- (1/3 C)
  2          Teaspoons  Active Dry Yeast -- (1 1/2 Tsp)


This is an outstanding bread!  It has a delicate, cake-like texture and combines the orange and caraway flavors which are popular in so many Scandinavian breads.  It's also good toasted.

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select a light crust setting, and press "start".

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

  6                  c  Flour
     1/2             c  Sugar

  2                 pk  Yeast
  2 1/4              c  Warm water -- 110 degrees

Cut shortening into flour, salt and sugar. Dissolve yeast in warm
  water and add to flour mixture, then add egg whites. Mix together,
  knead until smooth and elastic (DON'T overknead and add only enough
  flour to keep dough from sticking) and let rise 1-1/2 hours, or until
  doubled in size.

  Punch dough down, roll out on a lightly floured surface, shape into
  rolls and place in greased muffin tins . Let rise until doubled in
  size and bake in a 375 degree oven 10 to 12 minutes or until brown.

  NOTE: these rolls can also be frozen on cookie sheets and placed in
  zip-loc freezer bags for up to 4 weeks after they have been shaped
  before the second rising. Take out of freezer at least 3 hours before
  baking, place in greased tin and let thaw and rise until doubled in
  size.

  notes: these are an old family favorite and they're quite flexible.
  It's pretty hard to mess 'em up. They work as well for breakfast with
  jam or honey as they do with with dinner. Sometimes I substitute
  whole wheat flour for up to half the bread flour called for.

  I've successfully halved the recipe (3 cups bread flour, 1 pkg yeast
  or about 1-1/2 ts bulk) in my Hitachi ABM--BUT, BUT, BUT--I _don't_
  add the full amount of water at once. Rather, I start out with about
  7/8 cup and then dribble enough add'l water into the bread pan during
  the early stages of the knead cycle 'til the dough "looks right".

Wheat Bread from one of Donna German's cook books (the only bread machine
book I seem to be able to get in England at present).  The bread calls for
1.5 tb honey and 1.5 tb molasses in a 1 lb loaf.  It rose well, but when I
took it out of the machine the crust had separated from the bread, so if I
wanted I could easily have peeled off the top and bottom crusts.  Does anyone
know why this is?  Is it because of the high sugar content?  The whole recipe
follows so that you can have some idea perhaps of what may have gone wrong.

2 lb loaf:
1 1/2 c water
1 1/2 T vegetable oil
2 1/2 T molasses
2 1/2 T honey
1 egg
1 t salt
1/3 c wheat germ
1/3 c whole bran cereal
1/3 c rolled oats
2 c whole-wheat flour
2 c bread flour
1/3 c instant dry milk powder
2 Tgluten flour, 100%  (not used)
2 t yeast, rapid-rise ORquick

Cycle white, wheat, sweet, timed.

flour gradually -- knead until smooth and satiny.

Shape into 4 loaves, brush witha little melted butter, let rise.

Cut loaves into thick slices, dip into melted butter, place in pan, and let
rise again.

Bake in hot oven (400-425 degrees F) until golden and crusty, about 40 minutes.

                             Muffaletta Bread

Recipe By     :SHERI K THOMASSON <SKTHOM@ccmail.monsanto.com>
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                Breads, Quick/Muffins/Rolls     Low Fat
                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1            package  dry yeast -- (about 1 T)
  3               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening

Here's a bread recipe I recently concocted to resemble Muffaletta bread.

I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and run on "dough" setting.  When
done, I take it out, roll it into a large, not too thin, rectangle.  Then I
sprinkle on 1 can of chopped green chiles and 1 to 1.5 cups shredded cheddar.
Roll up jelly roll fashion, then form the roll into a coil shape.

On greased baking sheet,  spritz with olive oil.  Cover with plastic.  Rise 1
hour.  Cook at 425 for 10 mins.  Reduce to 375 and bake 25 mins.

Hope you enjoy it if you try it!  My family loves it!

  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

From "The World Atlas of Food" (A Gourmet's Guide to the Great Regional Dishes of the World) 1984, Exeter Books, Distributed by Bookthrift(Simon & Shuster)  ISBN 0-671-07211-0

Traditionally cooked in a tandoor, a large clay oven, this North Indian bread
gets its teardrop shape from being stuck on the wall of the oven and
stretching while it cooks.

Makes 4 Naans

Sift the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and soda into a bowl.  In another
bowl, mix together the egg, yogurt, 4 Tbl. of the milk and half the ghee or
melted butter.
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.  Pour in the liquid mixture
and work into the flour until the mixture forms a dough.  Knead the dough on
a lightly floured surface for 15 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.
 Dust with flour if the dough is sticky.  Pat the dough into a ball and put
it into a bowl.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and set it aside in a warm,
draft-free place for 3 hours.

With floured hands, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Shape them into
balls.  Flatten the balls and then pat and pull them into flat oval shapes
about 6 inches long.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush one side of the naans with the
remaining ghee or melted butter and the other side with the remaining milk.
 Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the naans.  Place the naans on baking sheets
and bake for 5 minutes or until they are golden and firm to the touch. Remove
from the oven and turn the naans over and brown them under a hot broiler.
 Serve hot.

Add ingredients according to your machine directions.

This makes a small loaf.

Here is a great bread recipe that I use all the time to make rolls of all
kinds. I use lowfat buttermilk and  dried chives or dried onions. there are
no limits. I use the dough cycle on the bread machine to do all the work.
Then I put little balls about 2 oz each into muffin cups let rise and bake
in a 375 degrees F. for 10 to 12 minutes. Sometimes I make hot dog buns and
hamburger buns, bake on cookie sheets.
They are soft inside, with a light crust on the outside. You can use egg
substitute also. If you make these rolls you wont be disappointed. Tonight
I''m going to make cheese (lowfat cheese)rolls.

Cycle: white

Crust:light

NOTES : After tasting this bread at a friend's house, I asked
  for the recipe. I was surprised at how easy it was to
  make:  All you do is combine the ingredients in a
  large Tupperware container, and seal the lid. The
  dough "burps" the lid off the container when it has
  finished rising ------- Diane Davis, Birmingham,

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3              c  water
  2 1/2           tbsp  butter

  1                tsp  salt
     2/3           cup  oat bran
     2/3             c  oats -- flaked is best
     2/3             c  oat flour
  2                  c  bread flour
     1/4             c  nonfat dry milk
  2 1/2            tsp  yeast

It's a dense loaf, kind of grainy in texture, but the oat flavour is  wonderfull.

I made with 1 1/2 ts yeast in my zo.  Bread was nice-textured, dense as promised but flatish.  Almost like something that has risen and then fallen down sides.  This was a very very dry dough, I skimped on the water.

NOTES :   I find this to be a great rye recipe!  I like a strong flavored
rye and use both options to get the full effect.  This recipe
rises better than some others, but that is probably because the
actual rye flour is only one cup.

                          Olive And Thyme Bread

                Hand Made                       Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           Cups  water -- 105-115 degrees
  1 1/4           Cups  basic bread sponge
  3 1/4           Cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
     1/3           Cup  all-purpose flour -- for kneading
  4          Teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2           Cup  Olives -- Kalamata,
                         -- Pit & Chop Roughly
  4          Teaspoons  fresh thyme -- coarsely chopped

Can use any fleshy black olive in place of Kalamatas.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge into the water, breaking the sponge up using your hands or
a spoon.

Add 3 1/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding until
the dough gathers into a single mass. Mix in the olives and thyme until
distributed.  This dough will be wet and sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead as much of
the 1/3 cup of flour as is required to make a smooth and elastic dough.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate overnight.

Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place in an oiled
bowl and cover with plastic.  Allow to rise in a draft-free location for
two hours.

Turn out each piece of the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and
press out any large bubbles.  Shape each half into a loose oval.  Transfer
each of the ovals into a 9x5 loaf pan, with the seam on the bottom.  Cover
again with plastic and allow to double in bulk, which should take 2 to 2
1/2 hours.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking stone or
tiles on the middle rack to 425.   Place a baking pan with decent sides on
the bottom shelf.  Boil two cups of water.   Place the loaf pans on the
stones and then immediately pour the boiling water into the baking pan.

Bake for 35-40 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when removed
from the pans and tapped on the bottom.  Take the loaves out of the pans
and cool on a rack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  bread flour
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  olive brine -- liquid
  2                tbs  oil
  2                tbs  sugar
     1/2           cup  olives -- coarse chopped
                         -- (salad olives)
  2                tsp  yeast

Place ingredients ( 80 to 100 degrees ) in your breadmaker per manufactures
instructions. Add more flour ( or liquid ) if needed to achieve a dough ball
that is pliable and slightly tacky ( no dough adheres to your finger when
touched ) and bake on the white bread cycle.

As for the olive bread, I find that 1/4 cup of liquid brine was sufficient.
It was plenty tasty. You could add more brine and less water for your
experimentations.Coarse chop olives or they may be to finely incorporated
into the bread.

These breads were wonderful for last weekends family barbecue and devoured.
I've made these breads plenty of times and you should have a beautiful tall
moist loaf. You can email me if you have questions.

.
In ancient Greek mythology Zeus uses the olive branch as a symbol of live.
 This association could not be more appropriate, since olive oil is a
natural product of the earth with many nutritive properties.
This fragrant breadd, made from garlic-infused olive oil, is delicious
when lightly toasted, covered with sun-ripened tomatoes and basil and
drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil
.
My recipe for galic olive oil follows but, if you don;t have the time, it
is available at certain supermarkets or specialty food stores.  If making
the garlic olive at home, do so so the day before you plan to make this
bread, since the garlic should steep in the oil for at least 6 hours
before using.

All ingredients must be at toom temperature, unless otherwise noted. Add
ingredients in the order specified in your bread machine owner's manual.
Set bread machine on the basic/standard bread making setting. Select
medium or normal baking cycle.  The programmable timer can be used, if
desired.

NOTE:  To make the garlic olive oil, heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a
small, heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  When the oil begins to
smoke, remove from heat immediately and let cool for 10 minutes.  Add the
prepared garlic cloves.  Let st4eep for at least six hours at room
temperature.
Remove garlic cloves from oil and discard.  Store any unused garlic oil in
the refrigerator for up to seven days.

NOTES : This, per request, is a Beer Bread for the bread machine.  It's very
chewy and should be sliced thin to go with ham or strong cheese.  It's
the type used for smorgesbord sandwiches, i.e. dollops of horseradish,
sour cream and good strong pickles, thin sliced roast beef.  I should
think it would be good with soup or stew as well.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Tbsp  vegetable broth -- or any flavor broth
  12                 C  Yellow Onions -- Thinly Sliced
     1/4             C  balsamic vinegar

In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the broth.
Add the onion, cover, and cook until translucent and very
soft, about 45 minutes.
Uncover, lower the heat, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring
periodically.  Add the vinegar and cook until the onion is
caramelized, about 1 hour longer.  Use immediately, or
store in a glass or plastic container in the refrigerator
for up to 10 days.
Makes 2 cups.
Use as a pizza topping.

Sorry for the name of the person who send it.
She commented she had used it for pizza, and included the pizza recipe, I
did not save that.
Well, today I made 1/2 of my normal whole wheat bread recipe, and while it
was rising, I started a sort of above recipe.
I put apple juice in a pan, and then added 16 normal sliced onions.  I did
not know what yellow onions were.
After a while, long while, when they became transparent I added some lemon
juice, then I let them cook and cook for over an hour.
I did not know what it meant that they would caramelize, (help accepted
here) so when there was no more liquid I put them over my dough, which I had
stretched out and had left about 1/2 hour to rise again, already stretched.
Then I put half of the onions on the dough and put it for 20 mins in a very
hot oven, then 10 mins in the broiler (that thing at the bottom of the oven
that makes things nice and if not careful burns them!)

The result was delicious.
I will make the other half of onions in a pizza next week.
We had that with a cucumber salad, it was great.

     1/3           Cup  flour
     1/2      Teaspoon  yeast -- granulated
                 Pinch  sugar
  1              Whole  onion


Get a good, fresh onion (I have used white, yellow, red,
and those cute little pearl onions). Peel it & cut it into
a manageable-sized piece.

In a jar, mix about 1/3 c. warm water (about 100 deg.), 1/3
c. flour, 1/2 tsp. granulated yeast (to get it going), a
*pinch* of sugar (just a bit--you want to let all that sugar
in the onion do the majority of the work!). Mix this all this
stuff up til it's good & smooth.

Take a piece of cheese cloth, wet it with lukewarm water and
wrap the onion piece in it; tie with a string & put it in
the flour mixture. Just take care of this like any starter
(stirring every day, etc.). At the end of 1-2 weeks (depending
on how it's coming along), discard the onion. This makes great
sourdough onion dill bread!

  1                Tsp  orange extract -- (not in original)


(adapted from various recipes)

I suspect the real trick to getting a strong orange flavor is the
orange extract.

Use the sweet bread setting if you have one; I had a lot of trouble
with burnt-tasting crusts with this recipe.  In the Welbilt model, I
sometimes got gooey centers (although 90% of the loaf was excellent.)
I can't wait to try it in my new Zojirushi. :-)

     1/4           cup  water -- 110 degrees
  1                cup  orange juice -- room temp (80
                        degrees)
  2        tablespoons  orange rind -- grated

  2        tablespoons  vital wheat gluten
  2 1/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        --special instant yeast, King Arthur Flour


Place in the machine in the order listed. Select white bread & press start.

For those who need to know - 6.1% cff, I tried the following recipe Sunday, subbing 1/4t pressed orange oil for the grated rind.  The bread rose up against the glass and probably would have kept going.  Tastes excellent!

Next time I will probably back the gluten down to 1 Tablespoon.

Small Loaf:  1/2 C orange juice, 1 T butter or margarine, 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t grated orange peel, 1/3 t salt, 1 t sugar, 1 1/2 C bread flour, 1 t active dry yeast, 1/4 C raisins

I microwave the OJ and margarine for 1 minute, to warm it.

* We have the Hitachi machine that makes a loaf of a little less than
1-1/2 pounds.  It handles 3 cups of flour very well, but seems to
have a harder time forming a dough ball with greater amounts of
flour.  One thing that I noticed with the recipes in this cookbook is
that frequently the "Large" recipe calls for a total of more than 3
cups of flour/oatmeal/wheat germ.  The Hitachi has difficulty in
dealing with this.  (If I am around when I start the bread, I can
help it get started; however, most often I bake bread on the timer,
so that it is ready for breakfast.)  The "Medium" recipe, however,
often produces a short loaf that lasts for about 10 minutes around
here.  What I have found is that a larger loaf is produced by using
the proportions of liquid to flour that the Hitachi cookbook
suggests:  use 1-1/8 cup of liquid to 3 cups of flour for a loaf that
rises to the top of the baking pan.

** I have also found that there is absolutely no difference in volume
of the bread or how well it rises if I use 1-1/2 teaspoons of yeast
rather than 2-1/2 teaspoons.  The most critical element to producing
a good loaf seems to relate to the temperature of the ingredients.
If you keep your yeast in the refrig, allow it to warm up for about
1/2 hour before making the bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           Cup  water
     1/2           Cup  orange juice
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  grated orange peel
  1         Tablespoon  brown sugar -- or molasses
     3/4      Teaspoon  salt
  2 3/4           Cups  bread flour -- (see my note
                        for how well I measure flour)
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  active dry yeast

(don't follow this recipe without water in hand)
This recipe has a total of 3/4 c. liquid as written.

I have a Breadman Plus machine.  After 11 minutes of kneading, the dough
was so stiff the machine almost quit working and sounded very
overworked (never had this problem with any recipe before).  I added 1 T
water, which was not enough and continued until
I had added 3 T additional water total.  The dough was still very stiff,
but as this was my first experience with bagels I did not add anymore
water.  The resulting dough was so dry that it was almost separating in
layers as I was trying to form bagels.  Another thing was that Meilach
suggests a second 20 minute rise after the bagels are formed.  This
produced a very airy light non-bagel like bagel when I applied it to the
cinnamon raisin bagels below. [Angela]

  batter into a greased/floured 2 pound coffee can.  Place on a trivet
  in the crockery pot.  I used a canning jar lid.  Cover can with 4 to
  5 paper towels.  Place crock pot lid on resting against a couple of
  toothpicks or a prop on one side so the steam can escape.  Cook on high
  setting 300F, and allow 3 1/2 hours for a 3.5 quart crock pot or 4 hours
  for the larger 4 1/2 quart crock pot, till the toothpick inserted into
  the center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  Remove
  from can and cool.

  Seems to me I just sprayed the can with pam.

                        Challah recipe
  12            ounces  chocolate chips

In an attempt to make something that tasted at least vaguely like Pain
au Chocolate (for the non-speakers of French out there, that's French for
"Bread with Chocolate", not "Painful Chocolate"; it's very yummy stuff),
i made the recipe for challah in the Donna German breadmaker book (volume 1)
and, at the add-raisins-now beep i added a 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips.

It came out tasting vaguely like Pain au Chocolate, and absolutely delicious!
It was even better on the second day, once the chips had had a chance to
re-solidify.  This is an experiment definitely worth trying!

Dough Setting
Makes two 6 x 4" oval loaves

The addition of lemon zest to a rye and wheat bread yields a
citrus-scented bread you'll love with seafood and pates.  Shape the breads
like big lemons.  The crust will be golden brown, and the crumb dense and
aromatic.  The bread keeps at least 3 days wrapped in nothing but a paper
bag.

Place all ingredients in the bread machine pan and process on the dough
setting, then remove to a lightly floured surface and punch down.  Knead a
moment or two, then divide the dough into two pieces.

Shape each piece into a football (or lemon) shape - a short, thick oval
with pointed ends.  Place on parchment paper sprinkled with cornmeal and
set on a baking sheet.  Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in
a warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in bulk, no more than 1 hr.
Make 3 quick, slashes in the top of each risen loaf.

While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 450 deg F.  Bake until
golden brown and done through, about 30 min.  Remove to a rack and cool
thoroughly before slicing.

This is quite tasty.

                        Sponge:
  1                Cup  Champagne -- Brut
  2                Tsp  yeast
  1                Cup  White Flour -- Unbleached

  1                     Egg -- Extra Large
                        Above sponge


Prepare the sponge the night before using brut champagne ( dry , not sweet
). Pour champagne into a bowl, sprinkle on yeast and stir to dissolve. Add
flour and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 12
hours. To complete the bread: Place all the room temp ingredients into the
breadmaker following your breadmakers instructions and use the white bread
mode and press start.Authors note: this is a very interesting and elegant
white bread. You must use brut champagne as to sweet champagne will kill the
yeast.

For Betty who asked me if I used a sponge for the bread machine. No, I
haven't tried a sponge for a bread machine. I have seen recipes for it
mentioned in several bread machine cookbooks.The sponge is like a batter and
I assume it would rest in the bread machine an alloted amount of time before
the remaining bread ingredients are re mixed with it. Hope this answers your
question. See specific recipe below!

In using the sponge method, primarily most all the yeast and about 60% of the
flour and liquid are added to form a thick batter which is allowed to
ferment.then the remainder of the flour,salt, sugar, shortening,etc are
mixed and added in to form the dough. The yeast has a head start to develop
and the salt and shortening etc wont hinder its growth as it may do in the
straight dough method.

Here is a bread machine sponge from: Bread Machine Baking, Perfect Every
Time by Brody and Apter. I have not tried this.

                International Breads            Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4             C  Biga -- (180 G)
  1 1/2              C  Water -- At Room Temperature
     1/2             C  Whole Wheat Flour -- (65 Grams)
  3                  C  All-Purpose Flour -- To 3 3/4 C,
                         -- Unbleached, (435 G)
  2          teaspoons  Salt -- (10 G)
                        Cornmeal


      Yield: 2 loaves

  By Hand:
  =======
  Cut the starter into small pieces in a large mixing bowl. Add all but 1 to  2 Tb. of the water and mix until the starter is in fime shreads and the  liquid is chalky white. Stir in the whole wheat flour and most of the  all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time. When the dough is a fairly rough and shaggy mass, stir in the salt dissolved in the remaining water. Knead on a floured surface, sprinkling with up to 1/2 cup additional flour and using  the dough scraper to scrape up the fine film of dough that will accumulate  on the sork surface, as well as to turn and lift the dough. After about 5 minutes of kneading, slam the dough down hard several times to help  develop the gluten. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth, a total  of 8 to 12 minutes. The dough should still be soft, moist and sticky.

  By Mixer:
  ========
  Mix the starter and all but 1 to 2 Tbsp. of the water with the paddle in a large mixer bowl. Mix in the flours and then the salt dissolved in the remaining water. Change to the dough hook and knead at medium speed until
  soft, moist, and sticky but obviously elastic, about 4 minutes. Finish kneading by hand on a lightly floured surface, sprinkling with additional flour, until smooth but still soft.

  By Food Processor:
  =================
  Refrigerate the starter until cold. Process the starter and 1 1/2 cups cold water with the steel blade and remove to another bowl. Change to the dough blade and process the flours and salt with 2 or 3 pulses to sift.   With the machine running, pour the starter mixture through the fed tube as quickly as the flour can absorb it. Process 30 to 45 seconds longer to knead. The dough will be moist and sticky. Finish kneading by hand on a
  lightly floured surface, sprinkling with additional flour, until the dough  is smooth but still soft.

  First Rise:
  ==========
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The dough is ready when it has numberous bubbles and blisters under the skin.

  Shaping and Second Rise:
  =======================
  Divide the dough in half on a lightly floured surface without kneading it.  Shape into 2 round loaves. Let them relax under a cloth for 20 minutes.  Line baking sheets or peels with parchment paper and flour the paper
  generously. Roll each ball into a fat cylinder and place seam side down on  the paper. Dimple the loaves all over with your fingertips or knuckles, as  for focaccia, to keep the dough from springing up. The dough should feel
  delicate but extreme.ly springy. Cover the loaves and let rise until  doubled, with many visible air bubbles, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.

  Baking:
  ======
  Thirty minutes before baking, heat the oven with a baking stone in it to  425 degrees F. Sprinkle the baking stone with cornmeal. Carry the peel or  baking sheet to the oven and very gently invert the dough onto the stone.
  Gently remove the parchment paper, peeling off very slowly. Immediately  reduce the heat to 400 degrees F. and bake until golden, 35 to 40 minutes.
  Cool on wire racks.

  This dough can be made ahead and placed in the refrigerator for the second  rise; the flavor is better with the long cool development of the yeast.

  Serve this with stews and meats with rich sauces, with green salads, fresh cheeses, sliced salami, and smoked meats.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4      Teaspoons  dry yeast -- or 1/2 small cake
                         -- Fresh,(9 G)
     1/4           Cup  warm water
  3               Cups  water -- room temp
     3/4           Cup  Biga -- *(200 grams)
  7 1/2           Cups  all-purpose flour -- Unbleached,(1000 G)
  1         Tablespoon  salt -- Plus,(20 G)
  1                Tsp  Salt


* Biga: starter made from 1/4 tsp dry yeast, 1/4 c warm water, 3/4 cup
room temp water, and 2 1/2 cups flour.  Let this rise 6-24 hrs at cool
room temp, and store in the refrigerator until wanted.

Proof the yeast in the warm water. Add 3 c water and the starter, mix
till blended. Add flour and salt, mix till dough comes together and pulls
off the sides of the bowl. Knead 3-5 minutes in a mixer, longer by hand.
Dough will be very soft and elastic.  Let rise about 3 hours, shape into
3 round loaves or 2 big flattish ones. If you have baking stones, place
loaves on whatever you use to slide them into the oven with, or on your
baking sheets on sprinkled corn meal if you don't.   Let rise about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450F, and 5 to 10 minutes before baking flour the loaves'
tops and dimple them with your fingers.  Bake 50-60 minutes for big loaves,
30-35 minutes for little ones. Tap the loaves to test for doneness
(hollow=done) and cool on a rack.

I don't know if The Italian Baker is still in print, but it is an
excellent book, well worth hunting for. Senza il pane tutto diventa
orfano. (This, and some other sayings, came from her introduction.)

(2 large or 3 small loaves)

  1              Pinch  Salt -- Optional
                        Cornmeal


From _The Italian Baker_ by Carol Field

Some cookbook authors insist a bread made without salt could only be
flat and insipid, but the Tuscans have been making this saltless bread
for many centuries. . .  The big flat rounds scored in tac-tac-toe
patterns or the smaller crusty ovals of bread are sometimes rough and
somewhat coarse, sometimes more compact inside, but they are always
mellow and bland.

One explanation of the saltless bread is that the Tuscans, well known
for being tightfisted, couldn't bear to pay the government salt tax
and chose instead to make bread without it.  Perhaps, but gastronomes
point out that the Tuscan bread is perfectly suited to their cuisine,
which is full of strong flavors. . .

Makes 1 large _ruota_ or wheel, or 2 oval loaves.

STARTER:
Stir the yeast into the water in a small bowl; let stand until creamy,
about 10 minutes.  Add the flour and stir with about 100 strokes of a
wooden spoon, or stir with the paddle of an electric mixer for about 1
minute.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until tripled, 6 hours
to overnight.

DOUGH:
BY HAND:  Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl; let stand
until creamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the starter and 1 cup water and mix
well, squeezing the starter between your fingers to break it up.  Beat
in the flour, 1 cup at a time, and continue beating until the dough is
thoroughly mixed, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the salt, if desired,
in the last minutes.  Turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead,
using a dough scraper to begin with, until elastic, resilient, and some-
what velvety, 8 to 10 minutes.

BY MIXER:  Stir the yeast into the warm water in a small bowl; let stand
until creamy, 10 minutes.  Add the dissolved yeast and 1 cup water to
the starter in a large mixer bowl and mix with the paddle.  Beat in the
flour and continue beating until thoroughly mixed, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add
the salt, if desired, and beat 1 more minute.  Change to the dough hook
and knead until the dough is elastic, resilient, and somewhat velvety,
about 4 minutes.  Finish kneading by hand on a floured surface.

BY PROCESSOR:  If the capacity of your food processor is 7 cups or less,
process this dough in 2 batches.  Refrigerate the starter until cold.
Stir the yeast into the warm water; let stand until creamy, about 10
minutes.  Process the dissolved yeast, cold starter, and 1 cup cold
water with the steel blade to the consistency of lumpy pancake batter.
Pour the mixture into another container and change to the dough blade
without cleaning the bowl.  Add the flour and salt, if desired, to the
bowl and process with 2 or 3 pulses to sift.  With the machine running,
pour the starter mixture through the feed tube as quickly as the flour
can absorb it and process until the dough gathers into a ball.  Process
20 seconds longer to knead.  Don't worry if the dough never truly forms
a ball, but it should hold its shape and not ooze.  Finish kneading by
hand on a lightly floured surface until elastic, resilient, and somewhat
velvety.

First Rise.  Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap,
and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Shaping and Second Rise.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and
lightly dust the top with flour.  The dough will be very moist and soft,
but don't punch it down.  Flatten it with your hands and shape into
a large flat round loaf, or cut it in half and shape each half into an
oval.  Place on a well-floured baking sheet or peel and gently turn the
loaf over to collect some of the flour onto its surface.  Turn it again,
smooth side up, cover with a towel, and let rise until doubled, 45 minutes
to 1-1/4 hours.

Baking:  Thirty minutes before baking, heat the oven with a baking stone
in it to 450 degrees F.  If you have shaped the dough into a single
large wheel, score a tic-tac-toe pattern on top with a razor or sharp
bread knife.  Just before baking, sprinkle the stone with cornmeal and
slide the loaf into it.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 400 degrees
F., and bake 20 minutes for the smaller ovals and 25 to 30 minutes for the
large _ruota._  Cool on a rack.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- Or 1 Package
     1/2           Tsp  Sugar
  1                  C  Warm Water -- (105 - 115 Deg F)
  1 3/4              C  Bread Flour
  1                  C  Semolina Flour
     1/2             C  Shredded Parmesan Cheese -- *Note
  1                Tsp  Salt
  1                Tsp  Olive Oil -- **Note
  1               Tbsp  Semolina Flour

If you can't find semolina flour increase the bread flour to 2 1/4 C and add 1/2 C cornmeal.

*NOTE: Original recipe used 3/4 C finely shredded Parmesan cheese...I used 1/2 C.
**NOTE:  Original recipe used 2 tsp olive oil ... I used 1 tsp.

Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a small bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Place bread flour, 1 C semolina flour, cheese, and salt in a food processor; for food processor pulse 3 times or until blended...(for mixer I just briefly mixed it till blended).  With processor (or mixer) on slowly add yeast mixture and oil through food chute; process until dough forms a ball.  Process 40 additional seconds....(for mixer I just mixed it with the dough hook for another couple of minutes).  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 3 to 4 times.

Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg F), free from drafts, 1 hr 15 minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Punch dough down, divide into 2 equal portions.  Shape each portion into a 6 inch round loaf.  Place loaves on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray and sprinkled with 1 T semolina flour.  Make 2 (1/8 inch deep) diagonal cuts across the top of each loaf. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Preheat oven to 425 deg F.

Lightly spray loaves with water.  Bake at 425 deg F for 20 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped, misting loaves every 7 minutes during baking time.  Remove loaves from pan; let cool on a wire rack.

Note: Misting the bread with water gives the crust a chewy texture.  Simply fill a clean spray bottle with water and spritz bread frequently during baking.

Using a Kitchen Aid instead of a food processor:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a small bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Place bread flour, 1 C semolina flour, cheese, and salt in the mixing bowl with the bread hook and mix until blended.  With the mixer on slow add yeast mixture and oil through food chute; process until dough forms a ball,  another couple of minutes.

Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg F), free from drafts, 1 hr 15 minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Punch dough down, divide into 2 equal portions.  Shape each portion into a 6 inch round loaf.  Place loaves on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray and sprinkled with 1 T semolina flour.   Make 2 (1/8 inch deep) diagonal cuts across the top of each loaf. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Continue as above for food processor method.

Yield: 2 loaves, 8 servings per loaf.

This was **very** good!!

                Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 recipe your favorite white bread -- (3 cup flour size)
  3             ounces  pepperoni sausage -- (40 thin slices)
  4             ounces  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
  4             ounces  provolone cheese -- cut in matchsticks
  3        tablespoons  parmesan cheese -- grated
  1             medium  green pepper -- sliced, steamed,
                        -- and dried of any moisture
                        egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  water

Divide dough in half.
Roll out dough to a rectangle about 11" x 18".
Arrange half of pepperoni slices on dough leaving a 2" border on each side.
Sprinkle half of cheeses on top of pepperoni.
Arrange pepper on top of cheese.
Fold up dough into a log, sealing up edges as best as you can.
Place on cookie sheet (sprinkled with cormeal if you wish).
Mix egg yolk and water, and brush loaf with egg wash.
Bake at 350 for 25 minutes.
Makes 2 loaves.

my notes-I have given approximations only, you can adjust amounts
as you desire.  I bake these on a jelly roll pan because if you spring
a leak in the side of a loaf, which usually happens to me, the pepperoni
juices leak out.  I usually make one loaf with the green pepper and one
with chopped plum tomatoes.  I think these taste better cool or even
refrigerated.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 POUND:
  1 1/8           Cups  water
  3               Cups  all-purpose flour
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  1         Tablespoon  oil
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  active dry yeast -- Red Star
                        -- 1 POUND:
     3/4           Cup  water
  2               Cups  all-purpose flour
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  2          Teaspoons  oil
  1           Teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  active dry yeast -- Red Star


Place all ingredients in bread pan.  Select dough setting.
Press start.  When dough has risen long enough, machine will beep.
Turn dough onto a lightly floured countertop or cutting board.
Gently roll and stretch dough into a 12 inch rope.

FOR 1 1/2 POUND-With a sharp knife, divide dough into 8 pieces
FOR 1 POUND DOUGH-With a sharp knife, divide dough into 6 pieces

Roll each piece into a smooth ball.  With a rolling pin, roll each ball
into a 6 or inch circle.  Set aside on a lightly floured countertop;
Cover with a towel.  Let pitas rise about 30 minutes until slightly
puffy.
Position oven rack in middle of oven;preheat to 500 degrees.  Place
2 to 3 pitas on a wire cake rack.  Place cake rack directly on oven
rack; bake pitas 4 to 5 minutes until puffed and tops begin to brown
Remove from oven and immediately place pitas in a sealed brown

Paper bag or cover them with a damp towel until soft.  Once the pitas
are softened, either cut in half or split open the top edge for half or
whole pitas.  They can be stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator
for several days or in the freezer for 1 or 2 months.

1 1/2 POUND YIELDS 8 PITAS
1 POUND YIELDS 6 PITAS

HINTS:
Don't give up the first time if not perfect.  Here are tips:
1.  The pitas puff up during baking, so avoid using too much flour
while rolling them out.  Keep unrolled balls covered to avoid
them drying out.
2.  Those that don't puff up perfectly during baking were probably
torn or creased in handling, so handle with care while rolling
and transferring from counter to cake rack.
3.  Avoid overbaking, they will turn crisp and brittle.

                  ****


             For Perfect Loaves Every Time

* USE GOOD QUALITY HARD WHEAT FLOUR THAT HAS AT LEAST 12 GRAMS OF PROTEIN PER
CUP. (I like King Arthur)
* USE FRESH, QUICK DISSOLVING ACTIVE YEAST SUCH AS RED STAR.
* OPEN THE MACHINE AND CHECK THE DOUGH DURING THE FIRST 5 - 10 MINUTES OF THE
FIRST KNEADING CYCLE !!!   Even if your manual says not to do it.   Flour
acts as a sponge absorbing moisture on wet days and becoming dehydrated
during dry weather.  You'll have to adjust for fluctuating humidity and
barometric pressure by adding small amounts of flour or liquid to the dough.
 So, you've never made bread before.  How do you know how much to add?  If
the dough looks sticky and wet, is sticking to the bottom and sides of the
pan, then sprinkle in flour, a tablespoon at a time (you may need up to an
extra 1/2 cup) while the machine is kneading, until you have a smooth, firm
ball of dough.  If the mixture is dry and corrugated looking  or the dough
won't hold together then  sprinkle in additional liquid, a little at a time,
until the dough is smooth and pliable and forms a cohesive ball.   If you've
wandered away from your machine only to return to find a wet messy glob or a
dry desert thumping around in the machine, press STOP (you can do this at any
time - except if the machine has gone into the bake cycle), add a small
amount of flour or liquid and press START.  Stick around and make additional
adjustments, if necessary, until the dough looks right.
 You've never baked before - how can you tell if the dough looks right?  Go
to the stop.  Buy frozen dough, let it defrost according to the package
directions.   Place it on a lightly floured surface and play with it until
you are familiar with the consistency.    This is  what you're aiming for in
the bread machine.
I have found that when you are either making dough, or placing the
ingredients in the machine to make bread at that time, you can add either the
liquids first or the dry ingredients first.   The major exception to this is
the old DAK (no longer made) where the yeast must be placed in the bread pan
first in a position farthest away from the kneading blade.  When programming
ahead make sure to place any dried fruits away from contact with wet
ingredients  as they will absorb those liquids and throw off the recipe.

             EXTRAS
Extra kneads and extra rise times all contribute to the depth of flavor,
character of the crumb and general personality of a loaf of bread.  One of
the reasons I dislike rapid rise yeast and rapid cycles on the bread machines
is that the dough really requires the entire life span of the yeast to become
the amazing miracle that is bread.   If you are partial to whole grain breads
and are winding up with lower loaves than you wish, then try a double knead
cycle: place the ingredients in the machine and program for DOUGH or MANUAL.
 At the end of the final knead reprogram the machine for BREAD (of Whole
Wheat) and press start.  You've given the dough an extra work-out to develop
the gluten - that will result in a higher loaf.    For an even higher loaf
you can (if your machine permits) program for a longer rise time, or simply
remove the dough from the pan after the final rise cycle (but before baking)
transfer it to a bread pan and allow it to raise in a warm place until
doubled in bulk.  Then bake it in the oven.

Sweet doughs with lots of butter and eggs, also respond well to a second long
rise in a cool place.  I remove my brioche from the machine after the DOUGH
cycle is complete.  I place it in a large freezer strength zip lock bag and
refrigerate it overnight.  Then I place it back in the machine (my Zojirushi
has flexible programming), program for 2nd rise and bake.  If you can't
program your machine this way you can place the dough in a bread pan after
you remove it from the machine, give it a long, refrigerated rise, and then
bake it in the oven.  Even non-wheat and non-sweet doughs can benefit from

  15              Cups  Flour -- *Note,(15 To 16)
  5               Cups  Hot Water -- (95-105 Deg)
     1/2           Cup  Honey -- (Any Brand)
  2              Tblsp  Yeast -- Fermipan Brand

                        Add:
  5               Cups  whole-wheat flour
                        Add:
     1/3           Cup  vegetable oil
  1              Tblsp  salt
                        Add:
  7               Cups  flour -- (7 to 9)

*NOTE: I grind up 15-16 cups of flour first.  Then I pour into my Kitchen Aid mixing bowl

I grind my own wheat which is Hard White Spring Wheat from Montana and I
use Fermipan Yeast.  When I got this recipe from an acquaintance last year
I asked her what her brands she used of everything in the recipe and this
is exactly what I am sharing with you.  It is a lighter colored wheat
bread and has a wonderful flavor that does not leave a bitter sort of
aftertaste that I have experienced with my previous brands of wheat.

Let the first 4 ingredients sit for a few minutes to "proof" - it will begin to "grow" and will look bubbly and foamy.

Add whole-wheat flour and mix for 1 minute.

Add veg oil and salt, mix together another 1 minute.

Add flour until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.

Knead and rise as usually for any basic bread dough.

This will make 3 very large loaves or 4-5 smaller pan size loaves or
it is fun to make 12 of the very small loaves (maybe 2 1/2 x 3" pans)

Now the sources:  I buy the Fermipan yeast from the K-Tech stores when
I am visiting my kids in Utah.  There is a K-Tech store in Linden and
one in Orem, and I am sure there are others around Salt Lake City.
Here is the address off of the Fermipan package that I just opened:

 Food Ingredients, Inc.
 King of Prussia, PA 19406
 1-800-662-GIST

The Hard White Spring Wheat I also have purchased at the K-Tech Store,
but they gave me the phone number of the farm in Montana that they
purchase from so that I could call and get the name of distributors
in my area (Portland, Oregon).  So here is that phone number:

 Wheat Montana
 1-800-535-2798
        (These people were very helpful)

Hope your results from this information is as successful as mine.  I
will be glad to help anyone further if needed.

Bon Appetit!

Pesto is a fresh herb sauce that is made from basil leaves, garalic, pine
nuts, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and extra-virgin olive oil.
White this sauce is usually served with pasta or minestrone, it can also
transform a loaf of bread into a frangrant bouquet.  With a light crumb
and crisp crust, pesto bread is a natural companion to any Italian meal.
Prepared pesto sauce is popping up more and more in supermarket dairy
cases along-side fresh pasta and noodles.  If you should have any pesto
left over, I suggest using it within a few days or freezing it for later
use.
All ingredients must be at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Add
ingredients in the order specified in your bread machine owner's manual.
Set bread machine on the basic/standard bread making setting. Select
medium or normal baking cycle.  The programmable timer can be used, if
desired.

  2              small  eggs -- or 1 large egg
                        few spoonfuls lukewarm water
                        Fillings:
                        --Cheese:
  2                     egg yolks
  1               tbsp  butter
  1                 lb  pot cheese -- mashed

     1/2                onion -- minced
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        salt and pepper
  2               tbsp  cottage cheese -- optional (2 to 3)
                        --or farmer cheese
                        drawn butter and Parmesan or bread crumbs
                        for topping
                        --Cabbage:
  2         small head  cabbage -- or 1 large
  2        tablespoons  dried mushrooms -- cooked
                        salt and pepper
                        topping of drawn butter with bread crumbs
                        or fried minced onion
                        --Fruit:
                        Blueberries
                        blackberries
                        cherries

Dough:
Mix flour, eggs and water and work dough until firm. Divide in 2 parts and roll each piece into a thin sheet on a floured board.  Arrange suffing by the spoonful along one edge of a piece of dough, 2 to 3 inches from edge. Fold over and cut out in shape of semi-circles with a pastry cutter or a glass.  Press edges of dough together.  Repeat until all the dough and filling have been used up.  If necessary, reroll leftover dough and repeat.  This is a fast way of making the pockets. Cook in boiling water like noodles, covered, so that they will steam. In a few minutes, when pockets rise to the top, they are done.  Serve with drawn butter.

Fillings:

Cheese:
Cream egg yolks and butter. Combine with cheese, season and mix thoroughly. For a sweet filling, and sugar and raisins.  Fill pockets as directed above.

Potato:
Cook, mash and season potatoes. Fry onion to a light, golden brown in butter.  Combine with mashed potato and season to taste; add cheese if desired.  Mix thoroughly and proceed to fill and
cook pockets.

Cabbage:
Prepare cabbage as directed for Sweet Cabbage:   Cut cabbage into small sections, core and parboil in salted water for 10 minutes.  Drain.  Add 1 tbsp butter, onion, and continue cooking until onion is lightly brown.  Add cabbage 3 tbs bouillon and salt and pepper.  Simmer, tightly covered, stirring occasionally, until soft - about 1 hour.  Dust with 2 tsp flour and add 1/2 tsp Maggi extract or Kitchen Bouquet, stir and let simmer another 5 minutes.

Combine with cabbage, season and use to fill pockets. Cook as directed and serve drawn butter
and bread crumbs or onions.

Fruit:
Fruit is an excellent filling if the "pierogi" are to be used as a
summer dish or as dessert.  Fill the dough pockets with a spoonful of berries each, or with 3 or 4 pitted cherries.  Press edges tightly and cook in boiling water as directed.  Serve with sour cream and sugar.  If sour cream is omitted, garnish with melted sweet butter.

Chop the meat very fine, combine with bread and season. Cook minced onion in butter until light
golden-brown and add to meat mixture. If meat is lean, add a little meat stock so that stuffing will not be too dry.

Make dough, mixing flour, eggs and water together well.  Work until firm.
Roll into a very thin sheet. Cut into 3-inch squares.

Fill each pocket with a little of the stuffing, taking care to pinch edge
s securely together.  Cook in boiling salted water until pockets swim to the surface.  Drain, arrange in dish for serving, add the melted butter and sprinkle generously with Parmesan cheese. Excellent as luncheon dish or with clear soups.

  1                Cup  sour dough
  1 1/4           Cups  water


I set the ABM for dough, and when ready add flour as needed.
then I shape my circles, I have used a rolling pin, but last time tried,
with exit, a tortilla maker.  Once the "tortillas" are made, you have to
leave then about 1/2 an hour to rise.  Then you put them, flipping them, so
the side that was down is now up, on a cookie tray and into a very hot oven.
 When they start inflating you turn them over.

I make my normal bread recipe, that is in the breadmaker I put, more or less.

  8             ounces  active dry yeast -- ( 220 gm )
                        -- you also could use fresh
  1              quart  water -- (1 L)
  8                 oz  sugar -- ( 240 gm )
  6                 oz  salt -- ( 170 gm )
  3             ounces  malt syrup -- 0ptional (90 gm)
  1 1/4        gallons  water -- (4 1/2 L)
  22            pounds  bread flour -- ( 10 kg )
     1/2         ounce  commercial dough conditioner -- optional (15 gm)
  4                 oz  shortening -- optional (120 gm)


(about 124, 4 0z units )

Dissolve yeast in water and set aside to proof( foam )
Dissolve sugar, salt, malt in water.Add the flour to it and stir well. add
the dissolved yeast and mix well to form a dough. Add the shortening and mix
well and let rise until light. Punch down and let rest 20 minutes before
shaping. Scale ( weigh out ) into units( pieces )of 4 0z balls and let rest 15
minutes. Roll out to 1/8 inch thickness or slightly thicker circle.
Place on sheet pans or peels dusted with cornmeal. let proof ( rise ) 3/4 in
volume.Do not dock ( prick ). they will become puffy related to the
fermentation when they are baked as the moisture is released.
Bake in an oven or hearth on peels or baking sheets 460 degrees ( 237 to 240
C ) about 6 minutes. Units will be pale but done. They will collapse
partially when cool. However when baked properly the pita will have an open
pocket of dough.

Note: Typically in the Mid East a  10 to 11% protein flour is used. If you
use a stronger flour ( more gluten/protein ) your water amount will be
variable.
Note2: make sure your water temp is about 80 degree fareheit to maintain
proper dough temperature
Note 3: shortening is only added as a lubricant to the dough but it does
help condition the dough
Note4: if you plan to go commercial may I suggest you use dough conditioner
to inhibit mold and increase shelf life.
I dont know how you plan to use the 1000 pitas!! But good luck and glad I
could help somehow!!

                        yeast


For pita bread just use any ordinary flour, water, yeast, salt bread recipe
of your choice.  There is no magic recipe.  Do the dough in the usual way,
let it rise once.  Punch it down and do a superficial kneading.  Then
divide the dough into lumps - the size depends on what size pita you want.
A spherical blob that is about 1.5-2.0" in diameter will satisfy most
needs.  Knead each blob by holding it in one hand and kneading it with the
thumb of the opposite hand, always kneading into the middle of the blob
until it is silky and smooth.  Place kneaded blob on a lightly floured
surface and roll to a 6-7 inch pancake shape.  Place on lightly floured
board or cookie sheet, allowing space for a bit of expansion. Cover
potential pitas with a towel, then some plastic film, and let rise until a
bit puffy.  Gently move puffy pitas to a lightly greased cookie sheet and
put cookie sheet with pitas into a hot oven (400-450 F).  Watch carefully.
They should puff after a short wait.  Bake until just browning - you don't
want a brittle crust.

It is very easy after you try it once, and the failures are wonderful bread
in any case - puffed or not.

                        ****

Years ago, a friend taught me a trick for making pita breads inflate.
After you have let the dough rise, punched it down, and shaped it into
individual pitas (rolled thin), you place the pitas on a clean kitchen
towel to sit for 30 minutes (covered with another towel).  Then you place
them on an ungreased cookie sheet *UPSIDE*DOWN* to bake.  Something about
turning them upside down immediately before putting them in the oven helps
them to puff up.  Bake at 500 degrees F (or as hot as your oven will go)
until they are puffed--less than 5 minutes.  Unlike Jenka's husband, I
don't like them crispy but soft so that you can fill them with sandwich
fillings.  I, too, think you can use any plain bread recipe, but I'll be
glad to post the one I use if anyone wants it.  Last time I made pita, I
adjusted the ingredient amounts so that I could use the bread cycle of my
bread machine.  I couldn't believe how much easier that made the process,
as I could have the dough all ready for me to shape when I got home from
work.

For a bread machine, use the mode advised in recipe, or a "medium crust". Check doneness when finished, if not quite done, bake in an oven at 375F for 1/2 hour or more and test again for doness. If still not done, bake for 15-20 minutes longer. Store bread in plastic bag in refrigerator.

* I grind dry spices &  dried sun dried tomatoes in a coffee bean grinder,
but then DON'T use it to then grind coffee!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- 110-120 degrees F
  1             packet  active dry yeast
  1 1/4           tbsp  sugar
  3 1/4           cups  flour
     1/2           tsp  salt
  1               tbsp  olive oil
                        -- or butter flavoured oil

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.
Allow to sit for 8-10 minutes  (builds a good froth, so make sure this is in
a 2 cup or larger container, glass is best as it holds the heat nicely)

While yeast water is brewing, place the flour and salt in either a mixing bowl of a mixer with a
dough hook or the bowl of a bread machine set on manual (no bake cycle):

When water is ready,  add to flour, along with the olive oil.

Mix thoroughly for about 4-6 minutes, being ready to add flour or water if
neccessary (flour can vary from brand to brand) to make a smooth, springy
dough.  Dough should only be slightly sticky to the firm touch.

Remove dough from bowl and place in an airtight bag.  Do not seal bag, but
leave open in a nearly closed drape (that is, not wide open, but enough to
allow gasses from yeast to escape).  Set in a warm place for at lest one hour
and fifteen minutes.  This is the crucial part.  Most people don't allow the
dough to properly rise, resulting in a tough, unpleasant dough.

Roll out to cover a 14 inch pan for thicker crust, 16 inch pan for thinner
crust.  Permeate crust with fork in a similar fashion to the way used to keep
pie crusts from bubbling.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise an
additional 15-20 minutes.  Briefly repeat permeation with fork, though not as
thoroughly.

Prepare toppings and sauses as desired.  Cook pizza at 475 until crusts turns
golden brown on edges and cheese is browned and bubbling (presuming your has
cheese on it).

  1           teaspoon  dill -- or celery seeds
                        -- or any combo of seeds

Makes enough dough for 2-14" pizzas with a thin-ish crust.

I find that instead of cornmeal under the pizza, I like to lightly spray
the pan with olive oil spray.  I know this isn't traditional, but it gives
a crispier crust that stick less than when I use cornmeal.

This is a double recipe and it fits fine in my Zo.  I freeze half the
dough....see below about how I prep it for freezing and make a package that
is easy to store and very fast to use.  Since I roll it out before
freezing, I don't have to mess up my counter a second time before I bake
it.

Combine in order your bread machine likes and process on dough setting.
When done, divide dough in half.  Roll and use one half.

For the half to be frozen: roll out to the size you would like to use.
Cover with a sheet (or two in not wide enough) of plastic wrap.  Starting
at one end, loosely roll up the dough with the wrap on top (this allows
there to be wrap between each layer of dough). When done, wrap in a plastic
bag or antoher layer of wrap. Freeze flat.

To use: remove from freezer and when the dough is just about defrosted,
unfurl it out on a lightly oiled pan, keep it covered with the plastic wrap
that was frozen with it and allow to defrost and rise slightly before
adding toppings.

 I usually use 40/60 or 50/50 wheat/white flour.

                        *****


I worked in a pizzaria in New York during High School, and this is how we did
it there.  I make pizza about once a month.

What usually messes people up is that their dough is not round to begin with,
and is not of uniform density throughout.  If the dough is not uniformly dense,
you end up with it stretching easier in some directions than others, and you
end up with a lot of holes and thin spots.  Not good.

The key to success is a procedure called (amazingly enough) "rounding" the
dough.  I do this after the first rise, when I divide my large dough up into
two individual doughs (my pizzas are always born in pairs, it's easier that way
and you have a backup in case you mess one up).

So you take your dough out of its warm place and dump it on the counter and pat
off all the excess olive oil.  It will have a rough texture from the gasses
that have built up, and it will be puffy.  Punch it down on the counter to get
all the gas out of it, and divide it in half.  Use a scale, and if one is too
big, just cut a little piece off and jam it into the cut part of the other
piece.  Your goal is to try to keep the outside surface of the dough intact and
smooth, so you don't want to stick random pieces of dough to it.

Push the dough down on the counter and incorporate any little pieces you've
glued on to bring it up to weight.  Then, keeping the outside surface up at all
times, gently fold the dough over on itself in a downward direction.  Pretend
your stroking the top of an upright mushroom, with the heel of your hand at the
very top and your fingers pointing down.  As you stroke, the gluten sheet at
the top will stretch and relax.  Curve the stuff that comes down with your
fingers like you're shoving it up into the base of the mushroom.  Rotate 45
degrees and repeat, being careful not to tear the gluten sheet.  So it's
pull/shove/rotate/pull.

Once you've gone around a few times and the dough is a nice tight little ball,
scrunch the bottom together into a sort of nipple shape, so that it holds
together.  If it doesn't hold together, your dough is too oily, pat some off
and try again.

What you should end up with is a nice firm ball of dough with a round top and a
slightly flat bottom that doesn't unravel when you put it on the counter.  Let
it sit for a couple of minutes, and then oil a small bowl, plop the dough top
down into the bowl so the top gets oily, then flip it over so the bottom
gets oily, and then with the flat part of your fingers push the dough ball down
into the bottom of the bowl so it's like a pancake.  Cover with saran wrap and
allow to rise.

By the way, the only cookbook I've seen that describes this procedure well is
"The Italian Baker" by Carol Field.  Excellent book, highly recommended.

When you're ready to make the 'za, dump the dough out onto a floured surface
and pat off the olive oil.  Push it down into a pancake and flour both sides.
It should be perfectly round at this point.  The trick is to keep it that way.

Push it down with the flat of your hand like the hands of a clock, keeping it
round as you go in circles.  It will spread out as much as it can this way, and
should remain circular if your surface is will floured (don't be afraid of too
much flour at this point, you can always bang it off later).

Cup your left hand around the edge of the dough so that your little finger is
parallel to the edge, and with the fingertips of your right hand push down into
the edge making a trench about 1/2" from the edge.  This will be your crust.
Go all the way around as evenly as possible.

Pick the dough up by this trench and put your fists under the dough so that
it's hanging on the knuckles of the back of your hands.  Pull you hands ever so
gently apart, and inch or two at most.  This, combined with the weight of the
dough, will cause it to stretch.  Give the dough a little toss clockwise and do
the same thing.  Here again it helps if everything is well floured.


Pull, flip, pull, flip, very gently.  It helps to have a light source in back
of you so you can see thin spots developing.  Avoid holes, stay away from thin
spots if you can.  Once it's to the size you want, flop it down on your peel or
screen or pan and tug it into shape.  If you've done everything uniformly
around the circumference of the dough, you should have a perfectly round pizza
with about the thickness of a bedsheet.  Once you get good at it this all takes
about 20 seconds start to finish.

Flipping pizza is a good show, but in my opinion doesn't do much, so don't
worry about it.  It's not hard, but you occasionally tear a dough, so unless
you really trust your dough I wouldn't advise it.

*NOTE:  Original recipe used 2 T vegetable oil

If you don't have polenta you can use the same amounts of cornmeal.  The directions are for the dough setting, although this bread can be made and baked in a 1 lb machine. (Alas, the flavor will not be the same.)  Serve the loaf warm.

Add all the ingredients to the bread machine pan.  Process on the dough setting.  Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet or place a piece of parchment paper on a peel.

Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for a few seconds to remove any remaining air bubbles.  Shape into a ball and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand.  Place on the prepared baking sheet or peel.   Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and set aside to rise in a wram draft-free area until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 deg F, inserting a baking stone or tiles if you are not using a baking sheet.

When the dough has doubled in bulk, score the top with a sharp knife or razor blade held at a 45 deg angle to the bread.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until medium brown, on the middle rack of the preheated oven on the baking stone or tiles.  Transfer from the baking sheet or stone to cool on a rack.  Store wrapped in a plastic bag.

Excellent!!  Absolutely incredible flavor and texture.

  2                Tsp  Poppy Seeds
  1 1/2             Ts  Active Dry Yeast

It's one of the few fruit breads that actually tastes like the fruit.
(At least for a couple of days.  Like most bread recipes it's best
the first day or two.)

*NOTE:  For Welbilt machine add 1 more T buttermilk
**NOTE:  or frozen or canned, well drained, pitted/peeled, chopped

The peaches are juicy enough to provide all the liquid.
Consequently, the moisture content of the loaf is a tad unpredictable
so it's best to baby sit it thru the mixing cycle.

 (Reg & Machine)

In a large mixer bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups bread flour, rolled oats, yeast, sugar and salt; mix well.  Heat buttermilk, water and oil until very warm (120-130 degrees F).  Add	to flour mixture.  Blend at low	speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.  By hand, gradually stir in raisins, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and enough remaining flour to make a firm dough.	 Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes (dough may be slightly sticky).	Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1 hour (30 minutes for QUICK-RISE yeast).

 Punch down dough.  Form into loaf shape and place in a greased 9x5-inch bread pan.  Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1 hour (30 minutes for QUICK RISE yeast).  Brush top of loaf with egg wash (1 egg blended with  1 Tbsp water).  Sprinkle additional sunflower and sesame seeds on loaf.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from pan; cool.

 When using an automatic bread machine, place ingredients  into pan in the order suggested by the machine's manual.   The  recommended temperature for the liquid ingredients is 80 degrees F.   When the machine begins "BAKE" lift the lid.   Brush top of loaf with egg wash; sprinkle with additional  sunflower and sesame seeds.

     3/4      teaspoon  Rapid Rise yeast -- 1 tsp
                        --OR  1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast -- 2 tsp


Load machine according to manufacturer's recommendations.

The applesauce in the recipe is NOT a low fat substitute.  However you
may eliminate it and substitute butter, margarine, or baby food plums--
or even fresh plum or pear puree.  The applesauce or plums impart a
nice highlight to the flavor.  I only made the bread once, and used pureed
Japanese Satsuma plums in the recipe, as I have trees in my yard.  Bread
texture should not be affected by which ever you choose to use.  I also
loaded up on the port...to almost 1/4 cup.  But I am a port nut.

The recipe is for the bread machine.  In manual adaptation, be prepared
to add up to 1 1/2 cups of additional flour.  I would start with the
amount called for and increase flour in 1/4 cup increments, til proper
dough texture is achieved during kneading...

Also, you may omit the blue cheese with no ill side affects and make this
a TRUE PORT BREAD.  The sharper the blue cheese--the stronger the flavor
of the bread.  Loaf appearance will vary with the brand of cheese you
use.  This is a medium height loaf...dense.  I found this to be a nice
recipe.

It stated it made great croutons...and it did!  Pine nuts might also be an
option to play with.

**You need not use an expensive port...simply one with a good flavor.

Just a thought...slice thin for toast points for cheese or pate during wine
tasting....*:)  Or ham sandwiches, tailgate style.  Recommended to serve
warm, steamed with steak bbq.

For the Bread Machine:  *note conversion for rapid rise cycle or regular
(dry active yeast) bake cycles.

The flavor is really wonderful...I had never known what made Portuguese

                               Potato Bread

Recipe By     :(Gretchen Gregory)
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                Fatfree                         Hand Made
                Vegetable & Herb Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             Medium  potato -- about 1/2 lb.
  2        Tablespoons  honey
  2          Teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1         Tablespoon  oil -- optional
     1/4           Cup  warm water
  6               Cups  whole wheat flour -- (bread flour)
  1                Cup  nonfat yogurt -- or buttermilk
  2 1/2      Teaspoons  sea salt
  1                Cup  hot water -- From Cooking Potato

     Peel potato and trim off eyes and all dark spots.  Rinse, quarter, and
boil until tender.  Drain, reserving water.
     Dissolve  yeast in warm water.
     Mash potato and blend with liquids.  The blender works well.
     Combine flour and salt, mixing them thoroughly.  Combine liquids with
drys.  The dough will probably be a little bit stiff;  depending on how much
water your potato contained, it might be quite stiff.  Add water on your
hands as you knead about 20 minutes, until dough is very supple, soft, and
bouncy.
     Form dough in ball and place, smooth side up, in a greased bowl.  Cover
and keep warm for about 1&1/2 hours.  Poke center about 1/2" deep with wet
finger--if hole doesn't fill in at all or if the dough sighs, it is ready
for the next step.  Press dough flat, form into a smooth round, and let rise
again, about 45 minutes.
     Divide dough into 2 loaves, though if you've added extra potato flour
or if your flour is very good or if you are a super kneader, there may be
more dough than you require for two normal loaf pans.  Each loaf should
weigh about 1&3/4 pounds.  Make hearth loaves --or just form a couple buns
along with the two loaves.
     Let loaves rise in warm, humid place.  Dust lightly with fine flour, if
desired.  If making hearth loaves, slash tops.
     Bake at 350 degrees nearly 1 hour.
Note:  You can sub leftover mashed potatoes in recipe, using 1-1&1/2 cups.
You may desire to reduce salt in recipe if mashed potatoes contain butter
and salt.  Also, for richer flavor and better rise, add egg as part of the
liquid measure.
     For a close-textured crumb, particularly pale and milk-sweet, stir in
6 tablespoons powdered milk into dry ingredients.  This bread is light,
airy, and delicious.
Sesame Potato Bread:  Use sesame oil for the oil measure in the bread.  Roll
dough in sesame seeds after shaping loaf.  This is particularly delicious bread.

My adaptation, loosely based on a potato bread recipe in Bread Machine Magic.
The garlic and chives can be changed to any dried herbs you want.

5- About 2 1/2 hours before baking time, punch down dough. Grease 3 dozen
2 1/2-inch muffin pan cups  or 3 cookie sheets. Divide dough into 36 equal
pieces; roll each piece into a ball and place each into prepared
muffin-pan or on cookie sheets. Cover with clean kitchen towels and let

6- Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake rolls 12 to 15 minutes until golden
brown.

You asked for a potato roll recipe.  This is from my hometown recipe book.
I have not tried it personally yet, but my grandmother and I have made
kolache's with potato dough and they are great!  I do not have a bread
machine so I do it all by hand.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 3/4              C  bread flour
  1                Pkt  dry yeast
  1                Tsp  salt
  1                Tsp  sugar
  1                Tsp  celery seed
  1                Cup  hot water -- PLUS
  2               Tbsp  hot water
                        Water solution:
  8               Cups  water
     1/4           Cup  baking soda -- ( yes )
  2                Tbs  sugar
                        egg white glaze
                        coarse salt

Here is an unusal recipe for a cross between soft pretzel and a roll. The technique may remind you of bagel making!

Combine flour, yeast, salt, sugar and celery seeds and add enough water to  form a smooth elastic dough . This may be done by hand or food processor.  If using the food processor, process all one minute or so and if done by hand knead dough 5 minutes or until smooth , soft and pliable dough. Let dough rise double in a greased covered bowl.When double, punch down and divide into 8 pieces, rolling each piece into a ball. Using a serrated knife, cut an " X "  in top center of each ball. Cover with a tea towel and let rise double. Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and add the baking soda and sugar ( water will foam ). Carefully place 4 rolls in the water and cook 30 seconds. Lift out with slotted spoon and place on a cornmeal lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining rolls. Brush rolls with an egg white glaze ( 1 white mixed with a tsp+ of water ) and sprinkle with coarse salt if desired. Bake in a preheated 35 oven till browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on rack 10 minutes before serving. Note: boiling of rolls must be done to insure the soft pretzel like texture. Best served warm
and the day made. May freeze if desired. Yummy with honey mustard!

  1                  C  Warm Water
     1/2            Lb  Margarine -- Softened

                        Egg Wash -- 1 Egg/1 T Milk

  As you can see by previous Greek bread recipes, the
  Greek Housewives made plenty of bread. These recipes
  are directly from Greece and are in fairly large
  quantity.However this and other bread recipes can
  easily be halved for the smaller hosehold. All yeast
  breads freeze well too.

  Crumble yeast in the warm water and let dissolve. Beat
  the margarine until light and mix into the flour and
  yeast mixture. Then stir in the oil, sugar, salt,
  cinnamon, eggs if using ( a lighter baked good ) and
  the milk, adding " more if needed"  to produce a
  kneadable nonsticky dough. Knead smooth and elastic.
  Cover in a large bowl and let rise double. Punch down
  and let rise double again. Shape into 5 loaves and
  place in pans. Beat egg and milk together and brush
  loaves. Slash top of each bread. Bake 400 for 15
  minutes and then 375 for 30 to 40 minutes or until
  golden and done. Recipe can be halved easily.

Makes 5 loaves

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  9        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ginger
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon peel -- dried
     3/4           cup  whole-wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
     1/4           cup  canned pumpkin -- (or squash)
  2        tablespoons  canned pumpkin
  3             ounces  orange juice
  3             ounces  warm water
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter

 Most of our bread eaters like a lighter consistency bread
  so I substitute the wheat flour with bread flour.
  I cut back on the sugar a bit and use egg whites (less fat and calories).
  This makes a wonderfully light loaf that has a sweet pumpkin zip ...

  Experiment by adding raisins, nuts and/or seeds ....

  6        Tablespoons  sugar
  12               Oz.  beer -- at room temperature
  3               Cups  self-rising flour

by Rozanne Gold

Heat oven to 350F.  In medium-size enamel pot over medium heat,
cook sugar until caramelized and light-brown in colour; remove
from heat.  Slowly pour in beer; liquid will foam and bubble.
Mix well with wooden spoon until all sugar is dissolved.  In
large bowl, combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt (if desired);
slowly pour in liquid.  Mix until ingredients are incorporated
and dough is smooth.  Place dough in 9-inch nonstick loaf pan.
Bake until toothpick inserted into bread comes out clean, about
1 hour.  Remove bread from oven and let cool on rack.
Makes one loaf; 16 slices.

Notes:  In order to dissolve the sugar I had to keep the beer &
        sugar mixture over medium heat while stirring.  Let me
        know if you run into the same problem.  This bread was
        very flavorful.  Gold recommends that people experiment
        with various types of beer, stout and ale.

        BTW, this recipe by Rozanne Gold was printed in the
        September 1996 issue of Essence magazine.

Quinoa is an ancient South American high-protein grain recently
popularized in the United States.  This pearly, nutty grain adds texture
and nutritional value to a bread that makes good toast or sandwiches with
tuna, cold meat, or an assertive cheese.

To cook quinoa, add it to twice its measure of boiling water.  Simmer for
10 min.  Drain off any excess liquid and let cool.

Add the cooked quinoa and all remaining ingredients in the order suggested
by your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle
according to the manufacturer's directions.

aaaaah-Excellent!!

                        Raisin Bread recipe
  1                cup  pulp
                        Reduce the liquid in recipe by 1/2 cup
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon


I have a 1 1/2 pound Welbilt and I make a moist dark bread using carrot pulp saved from my juicer (can you tell I like gadgets?). To a standard raisin bread recipe I add 1 cup of pulp and reduce the water in the recipe by 1/2 cup. I like a tsp of cinnamon in this, too. Since the moisture content of juicer pulp can vary, my failsafe for the water  is to start the machine with everything added but the raisins, but with only about half the water I expect to use. Then after a few minutes of  mixing I drizzle water in SLOWLY till the dough forms a smooth,  slightly sticky ball. Too sticky and the bread tends to fall. Too dry and the bread is a bit too dense and dry. Have fun!

                        -- 1 1/2 lb loaf:
                        Dry group:
     1/2           cup  vital wheat gluten
     1/2           cup  quinoa flour
  1                cup  barley flour
  1                cup  brown rice flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  powdered whey
                        Wet group:
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1 1/4            tsp  salt
                        Yeast:
                        Raisins:
  1            package  raisins -- (2-1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  Glenfiddich -- (yes, single malt
                        scotch, not brandy)

To make a bread more cake-y, try using a substantial amount of barley flour
with perhaps some brown rice flour, and omit the wheat.  Barley flour makes
a yeast bread with a very soft, cake-like texture.

Of course you will want to add gluten.  I am allergic to wheat, though not
to gluten.  I have found that when using low-gluten flours if  I add 1/2
cup vital wheat gluten to 2 1/2 cups low-gluten flour I get a fine-textured
loaf.  It does not rise much, but the texture is wonderful! [Susan]

Mix raisins with scotch.  Place wet group in pan,  dry group on top, yeast
on top of that.  Medium wheat cycle (20 minutes knead, 25 minutes first
rise, 50 minutes second rise, bake 55 minutes).   Add the raisins and
scotch after 12 minutes of kneading.  You may need to help the kneading
with a rubber spatula -- depends on your machine and the precise moisture
of your ingredients.  Don't expect much rise;  this bread is fine-textured.

                Breads                          Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        This technique is for yeast breads only

Four steps:
  1. Cut the recipe down so it will make one loaf.
  2. Determine the parameters of your bread machine.
  3. Determine the liquidity ratio of the recipe.
  4. Determine the overall bulk of the recipe.

1. Reducing recipe size.
      Most recipes tell how many loaves they make.  Some will tell the size of
the loaf.  Cut the recipe down so it will make one loaf.
      A rough judgement can be made by looking at the flour required.  A 1
pound loaf requires about 2 cups of flour.  Therefore if your recipe calls for
6 cups of flour, you can figure it will make 3 - 1 pound loaves or 2 - 1 1/2
pound loaves.

2.  Determine machine parameters.
      Since each machine varies in its capacity and motor power, you must
determine the acceptable ranges for your machine in two categories: liquidity
ratio and bulk.  To find your machine's range, look at the basic white bread
recipe that came with the machine.  Determine the number of cups of flour
called for.  Follow that column until you find the row that shows the number
of ounces of liquid (water or milk) called for in the recipe.  In that box you
will find the ratio range for your machine.  Highlight or write down the ratio
range.

      Bulk is determined by the number of cups of flour called for in the
basic white bread recipe for your machine.  If the recipe calls for 2 to 2 1/2
cups of flour, you have a 1 pound machine.  If the recipe calls for 3 to 4
cups of flour you have a 1 1/2 pound (or greater) machine.

                        Bread Machine Liquidity Ratios

Ounces Liquid              Cups of Flour
1/8C = 1oz
                    2          2 1/2         3         3 1/2

      5           2.9-3.5     3.6-4.4     4.3-5.3     5.0-6.2
      6           2.4-3.0     3.0-3.6     3.6-4.4     4.2-5.2
      7           2.1-2.5     2.6-3.2     3.1-3.7     3.6-4.4
      8           1.8-2.2     2.3-2.8     2.7-3.3     3.2-3.9
      9           1.6-2.0     2.0-2.4     2.4-3.0     2.8-3.4
      10          1.4-1.8     1.8-2.2     2.2-2.6     2.5-3.1
      11          1.4-1.7     1.6-2.0     2.0-2.4     2.3-2.8

The ratio for my Zo is 2.89.  (3.25 cups flour / 1 1/8 cups water)

Ratio is computed by dividing dry ingredients by liquid.  Higher ratios
indicate stiffer dough.  Lower ratios indicate more liquid dough.

3.  Determining Liquidity Ratio.
      Using the following chart you now need to determine the liquidity ratio
of your recipe.  Fill in the ingredients and their amounts in the appropriate
columns.  Write the amounts as decimal fractions so you can use a calculator
later to add them up.  For example if the recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of flour
- put 2.5 in the dry cup column.  You'll have to determine whether an
ingredient is dry or wet.  Generally - use the form the ingredient is in when
you add it.  Exeptions to this are things that are goin to melt when heat is
applied such as butter, margarine, fresh cheese  or shortening.
      Some ingredients shouldn't be computed.  Don't include the following in
the calculation: yeast, raisins / nuts / seeds added at the mix cycle.
      You should count raisins / nuts / or seeds added initially as dry
ingredients.

      After you have entered all the ingredients, total each column and place
the sum in the subtotal box.  Then multiply the subtotal by the multiplier
specified and place the result in the total box.  Add the totals together for
wet and dry grand totals.  Then divide the dry grand total by the wet grand
total to compute the ratio for this recipe.

      For best results the ratio should fall within the range specified for
your machine from step 2.  If the ratio only misses by a few points it will
probably be satifactory.  If the ratio is below the range your dough might be
too wet. Try a slight reduction in liquid ingredients or an increase in dry
ingredients and recalculate.  If the ratio is above the range, it is too dry.
Add liquid or reduce the dry ingredients.

      You may still need to experiment a little but this calculation will get
you beyond the trial and error stage.

4.  Determining Bulk.
      You don't want to overflow the machine so make sure that the recipe
doesn't call for more than 2 1/2 cups of flour for a one pound machine, or
more than 3 1/2 cups for a 1 1/2 pound machine.  If you need to fine tune the
recipe make equal adjustments to both the wet and dry ingredients in order to
maintain the liquidity ratio.

After baking,
(while hot) brush on melted butter or
margarine mixed with garlic powder,
parsley flakes and Italian seasoning.
(Amounts will vary by the size batch
you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe
is for a large quantity, so you'll have
to reduce the ingredient quantities
by the size batch you desire.

Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2
C. Bisquick, 1/2 cup cold water,
and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will
yield about 12 biscuits.
You may also substitute soda water or
gingerale for the water, if desired.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --1 1/2 Lb Loaf: -- (1 lb loaf:)
  2 1/4            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- (1 1/2 t)
  2 1/2              C  Bread Flour -- (1 2/3 C)

  1 1/2           Tbsp  Sugar -- (1 T)
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt -- (1 t)
  1               Tbsp  Olive Oil -- (2 t)
  1 1/4              C  Water -- (3/4 C + 2 T)

Since I can't eat anything with pepper in it this is my version of this
bread.  I must say that it was EXCELLENT - even though I didn't have any
wheat germ to add (original recipe calls for wheat germ 3 T (2 T).

The next time I made this (the next day) I tossed in some toasted sesame
seeds and it was really good.

NOTES : * Any type of rice may be used for different flavors of bread, such as
brown, wild, basmati, white, etc. Rice doubles in volume when cooked. For
example, cook 1/4 cup rice grains in 1/2 cup water yields 1/2 cup cooked rice-
or just use leftover rice.

  2                tsp  active dry yeast

Add ingredients to bread bin in order of list. Select dough.  When
machine beeps- take out dough and shape into buns or add ingredients
for cinnamon rolls and let rise again in warm oven that is heated by
your oven light and a bowl of hot water.  Bake when risen double.

*When I rise my buns, I bake them for about 10 minutes and then throw
them off my cookie sheet onto my hot tile in the oven.
Then they bake for about another 10 minutes.  They are really crusty.
The tile is unglazed- that means it has no shiny finish.  Mine is
16"x16" and cost $10 Canadian including taxes.  My husband thinks
that it is really a large floor tile.  I sprinkle cornmeal on it and
the buns then bake with it on.

Bread Cycle:  white bread

This is based on a Betty Crocker Cookbook recipe for Rich Egg Bread, which I
adapted for use in my bread machine.  This is a cake-like bread that lasted less
than four hours in our household.  Even the puppy was begging for more!  (Okay,
well, maybe the puppy isn't a good indicator of food quality.  But the humans,
birds and one cat loved it too.  It was really good!)

I'm baking in the arid Arizona desert, so you may have to adjust the amount of
flour.  What I did:  put in 3 cps of flour with the other ingredients and start
the machine.  Watch the dough during the initial kneading cycle.  If it looks
gluey and wet, add more flour one tablespoon at a time.  Stop when the dough
looks "just right." If you aren't sure what "just right" dough looks like,
observe your own dough with a recipe you know works, then try this recipe.

My theory about adapting bread recipes:  my machine takes 3 cps of white flour
very nicely.  One package of dry active yeast is the same as 2 1/4 tsp. of
yeast.

Look at your original ingredient list.  If the recipe makes two loaves and calls
for 7 to 7 1/2 cps of flour, cut all the other ingredients in half.  Use 2 1/4
tsp yeast.  If you run into a peculiar amount of eggs, like 1 1/2 eggs, round up
and use a little more flour or a little less fluid.  Always watch the initial
kneading cycle the first time you try the recipe, and add more flour or liquid
as required.  WRITE DOWN ALL YOUR MEASUREMENTS so you can refine your recipe the
next time around.

                         Rosemary Olive Oil Bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           Cups  water -- 105-115 degrees
  2               Cups  basic bread sponge
  3        Tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        extra virgin olive oil -- for brushing
  3               Cups  All-Purpose Flour -- Unbleached
     1/3           Cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for kneading
     1/2           Cup  whole wheat flour -- preferably organic
     1/4           Cup  fresh rosemary -- finely chopped
  2        Tablespoons  kosher salt
                        cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Measure the rosemary *after* chopping.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge and 3 tablespoons oil into the water, breaking the sponge
up using your hands or a spoon.  Stir in the rosemary and salt.

Add 3 cups of the unbleached flour, the whole wheat flour, and salt and
mix, scraping and folding until the dough gathers into a single mass which
will be wet and sticky with strands hanging from your fingers.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and allow to rest for 3
minutes.  knead in as much of the 1/3 cup of flour as is required to make
a smooth, elastic and only slightly sticky dough (use as little flour as
is possible).  Shape into a ball.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, brush the top of the dough with
additional oil, and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm-up in a draft-free spot for
two hours.

Sprinkle a baking sheet without sides generously with cornmeal.  On a
floured work surface, halve the dough and then shape one piece into a
ball, pressing to remove any large bubbles at the edges.  Place the
dough-ball on the baking sheet, being sure to put the seam on the bottom.
Repeat with the second ball, leaving 3 to 4 inches between the two.  Cover
with plastic and  allow to rise until doubled, in a draft-free location.
This should take 2-2 1/2 hours.  These loaves will be flat and wide.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking stone or
tiles on the middle rack to 425.   Place a baking pan with decent sides on
the bottom shelf.  Boil two cups of water.   Brush the loaves again with
oil and then, using a razor blade, make a tic-tac-toe pattern in the top
of each of the loaves - do not tear the dough, you want to cut it.  Pour
the boiling water into the baking pan.  Slide the loaves off the sheet and
onto the stone.

Bake for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 and then bake for
another 30-35 minutes until the loaves are a light golden brown and hollow
sounding when tapped on the bottom.  When done, brush with additional
olive oil and transfer to cool on a rack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         Tablespoon  dry yeast -- (1 pkg)
  1           Teaspoon  sugar
  1                Cup  warm water
  15              Cups  white flour -- unbleached
  4 1/2    Tablespoons  salt
  5               Cups  warm water
                        (add 1 1/2 cups nonfat dry milk -- optional
                        to water and beat well)
  3        Tablespoons  olive oil

Proof the yeast by dissolving the yeast & sugar in 1 cup lukewarm water for
5 to 10 minutes.

Mix 14 cups flour and salt together in a large bowl, reserving 1 cup flour
for kneading.  Add 5 cups lukewarm water, oil, and the yeast mixture all at
once to flour.  Stir with wooden spoon or with hands until dough sticks
together.  Turn out onto a floured board or cloth and knead very well.
Gradually add the reserved flour to keep dough from sticking.  Kneading may

take 10 to 15 minutes.  Dough is ready when it feels elastic; bubbles will
break on the surface when you form it into a ball.
NOTE:  It is important to knead this dough sufficiently.  Proper kneading
will insure that the breads puff up, or balloon, during the short, very hot
baking time.  Otherwise, the air pocket that creates the top & bottom layers
of bread may not form completely.

Place in a greased bowl and cover with a dry cloth.  let dough rise in a
warm place, undisturbed, until it doubles in size (about 2 hours).  Punch
dough down.  Oil hands and divide dough into 25 to 30 balls the size of
small oranges.  Again, cover them with a dry cloth and place in a warm spot
to rise for 30 minutes.

Roll each ball into a 7 to 8 inch circle, 1/4 inch thick or less.  Place
circles of dough on flat boards or a table.  Cover with dry cloth and let
rise 1 hour.  Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place breads on baking sheets, 2 per sheet.  When you remove the dough
rounds to the baking sheets, flip them so the top side becomes the bottom
side on the sheet.  The moister surface is now exposed and rises more easily
than the other, which may have dried out slightly.  Bake in mid-oven, 2
sheets (4 breads) at a time, for 4 to 6 minutes.  After 2 to 3 minutes, the
breads will rise and balloon on the baking sheets.  Bake 2 to 3 minutes
longer, until just slightly brown on the bottom.

Slide breads onto a board to cool, and spray immediately with water.  Cover
with a damp cloth.  When completely cool, flatten them gently with your hand
and stack in a pile.  Cover stack with a damp tea towel for 2 to 3 hours.

Yield: 25 to 30 breads.  Freezes well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (3 1/2 to 4)
  4               cups  rye flour
  2               cups  all-Bran(r) Cereal
                        --or any whole bran cereal
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  instant coffee -- crystals
  2        tablespoons  caraway seed
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed -- crushed
  2 1/2              c  water
     1/3             c  molasses
     1/4             c  butter or margarine
  1             square  unsweetened chocolate -- (1 oz)
  2        tablespoons  vinegar
     1/2             c  cold water
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch

In a large mixing bowl combine 3 c of the all-purpose flour, 1 c of the
rye flour, bran cereal, yeast, instant coffee, caraway, sugar, fennel
seed, and 1 Tablespoon salt. In a saucepan, heat together 2 1/2 c water,
molasses, butter, chocolate and vinegar just until warm (115-120 F) and
chocolate and butter are almost melted; stir constantly. Add molasses
mixture to flour mixture in bowl. Beat a low speed 1/2 minute, scraping
bowl. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in remaining 3 c rye flour and
as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can mix in with a spoon.

Turn out into a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining
all-purpose flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and
elastic (6-8 min total). Dough may be slightly stickly because of the rye
flour. Shape into a ball. Place in a greased bowl; turn once. Cover; let
rise in a warm place till nearly double (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours).

Punch down; divide in half. Shape each half into a ball. Place on greased
baking sheets. Flatten slightly with palm of hand to a 6 to 7" diameter.
Cover; let rise till nearly double (30-45 min). Bake at 375 for 50-60 min
or till well browned and bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from
baking sheets; cool.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan combine 1/2 c cold water and cornstarch.
Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly; cook 1 min more. Brush over hot
bread.

Per serving: 126 cal; 2 g fat (recipe indicates this makes 32 servings)

  4                 Oz  pureed prunes baby food


Just worked out a Rye Bread recipe that I will share.  First of all, though,
after MUCH frustration in trying to perfect a Rye Bread recipe, I have
determined that the flour is the most important thing.  I started using
Hodgson Mills whole grain, and it is much to coursely ground.  I ended up
with bricks and door stoppers.  It was HORRIBLE.  I am now using a different
brand, I can't think of the name now, but they also make the whole wheat
pastry flour I buy.  It is much finer ground and I am sure must have a
higher gluten content.

I make all of my bread by hand, as I can't convince myself to have another
appliance on the kitchen counter.

Well, here is the recipe.

Dissolve the yeast in the water with the sugar and allow to proof.

Mix the prunes with the combined milk and water.

Combine the flours in a bowl and stir well.

In a separate bowl, start with the yeast and milk/prune mixture, and stir
well.  Add three cups of flour mixture, and stir till well mixed.  Add 2
cups of flour mixture on top and work in with your hands.  You may want to
put some flour directly on your hands and wring them like you are washing
them with the flour, this will help remove the goo from your fingers.  Work
in as much of the flour mixture as you can.

Knead on a floured board for 5 to 7 minutes, until it is elastic.

Place in a lightly sprayed bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a towel, and
let rise till double. 1 to 1 1/2 hours depending on the temp of your kitchen!

Punch down, reshape, and place in a 3 quart casserole dish that is sprayed
and coated with cornmeal.

Bake at 375 for 40 to 45 minutes.

Cover with a towel for about 30 minutes after removing from oven, this will
help make the crust soft.

You may want to add caraway, anise, or fennel seeds to this recipe.  I used
caraway, and liked it a lot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        I (Sourdough):
     1/3         Liter  water
  25             Grams  yeast
     1/2           Tsp  honey
  200            Grams  Rye Flour -- (Coarse)
                        II:
     3/8         Liter  water
  500            Grams  Rye -- Grains, Cracked/Cut
  200            Grams  wheat flour
                        III:
     1/2         Liter  Warm Water -- (0.5 to 0.75)
                        (ca. 32C/90F)
  2                Tsp  salt
  600            Grams  rye flour
                        (coarse)

I. Mix and cover with cling film, leave at room temperature 48 hours.

II. Mix with sourdough (I),cover with film and leave at room temperature for 24
hours.


Add to II and knead until the dough is smooth. Remove 0.15 liter of the dough
to act as sourdough next time.
Put in a 3 liter tin (Preferably the same shape as a regular toast bread).
Let the bread raise for 2 hours at room temperature.
Brush with water and make holes with a fork.
Bake 90 minutes in a preheated oven.
Freezes well.

NB! Rye bread is regularly eaten in Denmark for lunch, and is used for open
sandwiches, rye bread is rich in fibres and thus much more healthy than
regular bread. A roughly similar version is know in Germany as Schwartzbrot.
To make Danish open sanwiches, slice the bread thinly and cut each slice in
half. Just about anything that could go in a regular sandwich can be used on
top. An example could be: butter the slice of bread, put a small leaf of
lettuce on, put alternate slices of egg and tomato on (3 or 4 of each), put
a little mayo on top and sprinkle with freshly cut chives. Another version
could be a full slice of bread with a hamburger on top and fried onions. In a
near future I'll be typing up a collection of ideas for open sandwiches.

  2                tsp  whole caraway seed -- optional

    (ingredients in order of adding them to our machine)

If you use whole wheat bread flour, use less gluten. Don't cut the salt much!
For a higher loaf use 1 cup rye flour and 2.5 cups whole wheat flour.

"Here's this week's recipe. It's getting close! It makes a firm, slightly
sweet loaf with a small even crumb and a good rise."

  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        baking soda -- size of a pea
  1         tablespoon  cornmeal -- optional
                        flour


     Put a quart of warm water,--not scalding hot, but at blood-
heat,--into a pitcher, deep and of narrow mouth.  Beat into it one
teaspoonful of sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a lump of soda
not larger than a pea and (not necessarily, but preferably) a
tablespoonful of corn-meal, with enough flour to make a rather
thick, but not really stiff, batter.  Set your pitcher, well covered,
into a stone jar or other deep vessel, and surround it with blood-
warm water, setting it where such temperature will be quite evenly
maintained.  Never allow it to reach scalding heat.  In two and a
half hours, or, at the very most, three and a half, you will have
foaming yeast.  Now take a pan of flour, make a hole in the center,
pour in the foaming yeast with as much water, gradually mixed with
the yeast and flour, as will make the number of loaves desired.  Do
not make the dough very stiff.  It should quake visibly when the pan
is shaken.  Cover well with dry flour and clean cloths, set in a
warm place (temperature 80 degrees or 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or
thereabouts), and, as soon as light, knead into loaves, which will
soon rise enough for baking.  Do not delay baking after the last
rising, or your bread may have a slightly sour taste.  Bake thoroughly,
and no better or more wholesome fermented bread could be asked for.

 Dissolve a half-teaspoonful of salt in two cups of scalding
water, and beat in gradually enough flour to make a very soft
dough.  Beat for ten minutes, cover and set in a very warm place
for eight hours.  Now stir a teaspoonful of salt into a pint of
lukewarm milk and add enough flour to make a stiff batter before
working it into the risen dough.  Mix thouroughly, cover, and set
again in a warm place to rise until very light.  Turn into a
wooden bowl and knead in enough flour to make the batter of the
consistency of ordinary bread dough.  Make into loaves and set
those these to rise, and, when light, bake.

                   ***

  Salt rising bread is a bread made from a
  potato/cornmeal starter which produces the only
  leavening in the recipe. This is a fickle bread
  because sometimes the mixture doesnt "take ". It is
  called salt rising not because of salt content but
  because the bowl containing the starter was packed or
  surrounded by salt to keep the bread warm!

  The recipe is a challenge because of this. Technically
  it is not a hard bread to make. If your starter doesnt
  bubble, foam , smell yeasty or unpleasant ( like
  ripened cheese ) then DONT BOTHER TO CONTNUE WITH THE
  RECIPE.

  If you consult old cookbooks you will find a variety
  of salt rising recipes. This recipe was passed on by a
  person who has made delicious successful bread. Ive
  had great results with this recipe. Please remember
  one thing: salt rising breads demand constant
  warmth.So make sure even utensils are warm. The
  finished bread is most delicious with a texture
  similar to yeast risen breads. Salt rising breads tend
  to be heavier and denser than most yeast risen white
  breads. The bread is excellent toasted. Now see the
  separate recipe and tips.

  2               Tbsp  Shortening -- Melted Or Oil
  5                 Lb  Bread Flour -- Is Best

  Wash potatoes and peel well. I use Eastern potatoes
  which are common in my area and are the cheapest.
  Slice raw potatoes thinly into a large pyrex or
  ceramic bowl ( non reactive ).Add by sprinkling on the
  cornmeal, sugar,salt and pour over the boiling
  water.Wrap the bowl tightly with a heavy towel and
  cover the towel with a foil wrap. Place in a constant
  warm place overnight such as a radiator or on a low
  heat warming tray.Set the tray to 90 degrees or a
  warmth that is comfortable when touched but not to hot
  to touch. Then place a larger towel over the entire
  covered bowl. I find that 12 to 15 hours is a good
  time limit to produce the foamy starter. If the next
  morning the starter isnt foamy or doesnt smell strong,
  then do not continue with the recipe. You must have
  the foam and the smell!
  Now in a separate bowl, mix together the warm milk, (
  even skim is fine ), warm water, baking soda, salt and
  melted shortening or oil. Drain the potato mixture in
  a collander saving the starter liquid and mixing with
  the milk & water mixture. Stir in enough flour ( I use
  bread flour ) to make a smooth dough. Knead until
  smooth and elastic as you would for yeast dough, about
  8 minutes or so, adding more flour as needed to
  prevent stickiness. divide the kneaded dough into 6,
  greased 1 pound small loaf ( 8 x 4 ) pans or 4, 9x3
  loaf pans. dough should fill pan 1/3 full. Let the
  breads rise in a consisitent warm place covered (
  again use a 90 degree warm warming tray ) until breads
  are almost double and risen almost to tops of pans. (
  about 1 1/2 to 2 hours) . Bake in a 400 degree oven
  for 30 minutes or golden. remove to racks to cool.
  bvrush tops of loaves with melted butter. The
  characteristic strong odor you smell as the breads are
  baking will not overly manifest itself in the flavor
  of the bread. The bread has a nice grain and texture
  and pleasant taste. Great toasted.Freezes well.

Btw: people always ask about the 1/2 tsp baking soda. There seems to be
enough alkaline/acid reaction to give the bread a boost.Since this bread
always tastes and looks great I never omit it although you may find other
recipes that dont use it. The chief leavener comes from the fermented
potato/cornmeal mixture.

Makes 6 loaves of bread.

Someone asked for a recipe for salt-rising bread.  I haven't actually tried
this, but I believe this recipe has been in my family for hundreds of
years.  The instructions that I have were written down by my aunt about 50
years ago.  My mother tells me that this stuff really does smell awful
while its fermenting.  My father used to make it back when they were first
married during the depression.  They would set it on the furnace in the
hall of their apartment house, and apparently everyone in the apartment
house complained about it.  But my father claimed there was no better
tasting bread.

The secret of success with this bread is to keep it very warm so that it
can rise properly.

Peel and slice one medium sized potato thin and add it to 1 quart of
boiling water in which has been put 1 Tablespoon of sugar, 2 Tablespoons of
cornmeal, and 1 teaspoon of salt.  Keep the mixture warm overnight, 95-100
F. The next morning it should smell like beer.  Drain out the potato (I
assume this means keep the liquid, get rid of the potato) and add 1 cup of
scalded sweet milk.  Stir flour in until stiff, like muffin mix.  Keep
warm, 100-110 F, until it rises.  Then add 1 pint warm water, 1/2 cup
sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 Tablespoon lard, and flour until it is the
consistency of bread dough.  Do not knead.

Put into bread pans, let rise to double in bulk, and bake in a moderate,
375 F, oven 45 minutes to an hour.  The dough must never be allowed to
chill.

Joy of Cooking also has recipes for salt-rising bread.  I have no idea how
many loaves the above recipe makes.  It sounds like it might make half a
dozen loaves.  I'd be very interested in your results if you try this.

                              Sandwich Bread

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour -- divided
  1         tablespoon  nonfat dry milk powder
  2        tablespoons  gluten
  2        tablespoons  powdered whey -- optional
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  butter -- margarine or
                        shortening
  1                     egg
     3/4           cup  warm water

Place ingredients in ABM in order given (or reverse if necessary so liquids
are added first).  I put the egg in the bottom of a measuring cup and add
warm water to equal 3/4 cup.  I add more water, if necessary, by tablespoon
as the machine starts to mix.  Set machine for Normal or Manual setting.  I
confess that since this is used primarily for sandwiches and my machine
makes round loaves, I generally use the Manual setting. To do this, take the
dough from the machine when it beeps and quickly form into a log shape.
 This goes into a large loaf pan covered with a towel and doubles in size in
about 45-60 minutes.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Cool on rack.

This makes excellent plain bread for sandwiches.  I vary the recipe  by
substituting whole wheat flour for up to 1 cup of the bread flour and have
also tried using oat flour or finely ground oatmeal in place of 1/2 cup of
bread flour.  1/4 cup of wheat germ in lieu of same amount bread flour is
another additive that works well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole-wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  firmly packed brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  2        tablespoons  butter -- chilled and cut into
                        --pieces
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast -- (I use rapid-rise)
  1                cup  water -- cold or lukewarm
  3        tablespoons  water -- cold or lukewarm

Yield:  2 standard-sized loaves (using loaf pans)

Insert metal blade in work bowl of food processor.  Add flours, sugars,
salt, ginger, and butter; process for approx. 20 seconds.  Add yeast and
process for approximately 10 seconds more to fully mix the ingredients.

Add water; process until dough forms a ball in the work bowl.  Insert dough
blade and continue processing for approximately 2 minutes.  Remove dough to
greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap.

Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down.  Repeat.

Punch down dough; divide into two equal-sized pieces.  Form into loaves and
place in lightly greased (I use Pam cooking spray) loaf pans.  Cover loosely
with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location until
dough reaches the top of the loaf pans.

Preheat oven to 375F.  Uncover loaves and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove
loaves from pans and place back into oven, baking for 10 more minutes.
Remove to cooling racks and cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing.  If
freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 90 minutes).

This recipe yields an extremely fluffy, airy loaf with a very pleasant
texture which is perfect for making toast and sandwiches.

NOTE:  I have doubled this recipe when using my KitchenAid with excellent
results.

  P Place all ingredients in bread pan in order listed, or in the order
recommended for your machine. Set controls for whole wheat bread with
medium crust and start machine. Makes one 1.5-pound loaf.
NOTE:  Because the moisture content of the sauerkraut may vary, you might
have to add a bit more bread flour. Check the dough after about five
minutes of kneading and if it is sticky and has not formed into a ball,
sprinkle in more flour a tablespoonful at a time until it is firm enough.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  shortening -- (I used butter)
  1                cup  quick-cooking oats -- or regular oats
  1                cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  cold water -- (2 to 3)

Makes 18 oatcakes

Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Cut shortening into oats, flour,
baking soda, and salt until mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Add water, 1
tablespoon at a time, until mixture forms a stiff dough.  Roll until 1/8"
thick on lightly floured surface.  Cut into 2-1/2" rounds or squares (I use
any ol' cookie cutter that's around at the time).  Place on ungreased baking
sheet.  Bake until oatcakes start to brown, about 12-15 minutes.  Cool on
wire rack.

NOTE:  I found that my oatcakes required several minutes more before they
started turning golden brown...possibly about 20-22 minutes.  After that
long mine are still wonderfully flaky, slightly crunchy, and YUMMY!  So I
would suggest you go by their browned state rather than the exact time.

                  Semolina Bread With Black Sesame Seeds

                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1 7/8           Cups  water -- 105-115 degrees
  1 1/4           Cups  basic bread sponge
  3 1/2           Cups  durum wheat flour
     1/3           Cup  durum wheat flour -- for kneading
     1/3           Cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/4           Cup  black sesame seeds
  4          Teaspoons  kosher salt
                        cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Black sesame seeds may be available at health food stores or Japanese
markets.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge into the water, breaking the sponge up using your hands or
a spoon.

Add 3 1/2 cups of the durum flour, cornmeal, 2 tablespoons of sesame
seeds, and the salt and mix, scraping and folding until the dough gathers
into a single mass.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface,
and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, gradually adding as much of
the 1/3 cup of durum aas needed (but as little as you can get away with).

Shape into a ball and place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

After removing the dough from the refrigerator, allow to sit for two hours
in a draft-free location.

Sprinkle a baking sheet, without sides, generously with cornmeal.  Flour a
worksurface.  Halve the dough and flatten each half gently into a 10x12
inch rectangle.  Roll each rectangle tightly along a 10 inch side, making
two 12 inch cylinders.  Roll from the center towards the edge to make 20
inch ropes.  Coil the rope from one end, pulling up the center knot.
Place the coils on the baking sheet.

Mist the loaves lightly using a plant sprayer.  Spoon a tablespoon of the
seeds along each of the coils.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to
double in a draft-free location.  This should take 1 to 2 hours.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking stone or
tiles on the middle rack to 425.   Place a baking pan with decent sides on
the bottom shelf.  Boil two cups of water.  Pour the boiling water into
the baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the loaves off the sheet and
onto the stone.

Bake for 25 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when tapped on
the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.

Note:  Durum wheat is the hardest variety of wheat and makes a very
high-gluten flour.  Durum is made from the same wheat as semolina, but is
finely ground and is superior for making bread.  It can be found in health
food stores, specialty food markets, and some Italian markets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --1 1/2 lb:
                        Wet ingredients:
  1                cup  beer -- plus
  3                tbl  Beer -- (non-alcohol)
  2                tbl  Oil -- (canola)
  2                tbl  Honey

  1 1/4            cup  Semolina
     1/4           cup  Millet -- (whole)

Notes:

1. Beer is almost always the main fluid in my standard breads --
it gives them a bit heartier flavor and seems to help the rise.
I don't know how beer with alcohol might affect rising.  You can
always substitute water.

2. The Mid-Hudson River Valley where i live can get very humid in
the summer and very dry in the winter.  Because of this, the main
fluid measurement might vary by as much as + or - 2 tablespoons
(!) from the average amount in a recipe, depending on how much
moisture the flour has absorbed from the air.

3. Canola oil is high in mono-unsaturated fats (which help bring
cholesterol to the liver to be broken down) and very low in
saturated fats (which deposit cholesterol in the arteries).
Butter is very high in saturated fats, and many margarines are
high in trans-fatty acids, which may have detrimental effects
similar to saturated fats.

4. Off-the-shelf (supermarket) honeys are usually processed.
Unprocessed (raw) honeys might contain biologically active
ingredients which could play around with the rising.

5. If you try the Millet variation (highly recommended!), be
sure to use hulled Millet (the kind designed for humans, not
bird-food millet).  It gives a nice, soft crunchiness to the
loaf.  Rinse it in a strainer and let it drain before adding.  I
read somewhere that you can lightly toast the millet seed ahead
of time, but i haven't attempted it.

                          Semolina Sesame Bread

                        --1 1/2 Lb Loaf: -- (1 lb loaf)
  2                Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- (1 1/4 t)

  1 1/4              C  Water -- (3/4 C + 2 T)

Semolina flour is the strong, silent type:  It has great texture and
character, but a mild flavor that does not announce itself.  Its
understated nature  lets this bread go anywhere with almost anything -
alongside an assertive French or Italian sauce or under a ripe cheese.

Note:  The original recipe called for 3 T olive oil for the  larger loaf
and 2 T for the smaller loaf.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.

BREAD - A 7-grain bread for toasting or eating plain.

This bread was first made from whatever was settin' 'round the kitchen when
I started baking.  It has a wonderful texture and flavor.

(2 large loaves)

PROCEDURE
(1)  Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not
to kill the yeast when they are added to the dough.  If you want to
scald the milk, do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to
scald milk before baking with it, though I never do.)

(2)  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.

(3)  Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat,
soy flour, and rye flour.  Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter,
shortening, egg, and honey, and mix well.  Stir in the dissolved yeast
mixture.  Mix in the salt, and the whole wheat flour.

(4)  Stir in the white flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture
is stiff enough to knead.  You'll probably have about half of it left.

(5)  Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface.  Knead
the dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable.
Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten minutes.  It's
okay if you end up using less than or more than the three cups of white flour;
just use whatever it takes.

(6)  Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased.  Let
it rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around 85 deg. F is best,
though room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it has doubled
in bulk.

(7)  Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves, and place each
half into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased.  Let rise again,
for another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the loaves have about
doubled in bulk.

(8)  Preheat the oven to 350 deg. F as the bread finishes rising.  Bake the
bread for 35-40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from
the loaf pans, and rub the top of the loaves with some butter to give them
a nice, soft, chewy crust.

RATING
Difficulty: moderate.  Time: about 3 hours (half of it rising time).
Precision: approximate measurement OK.

Bake in ABM on regular cycle.

I use very warm water to offset the cold temp of the egg and applesauce
(which is usually in my fridge).

Note, the amounts of sugar and honey are equal, however, any amount of both
or each totalling 4 Tbsp works fine.

  2        Tablespoons  sugar
  3        Tablespoons  butter
  2           Packages  active dry yeast

This one has a few more changes in ingredients, but it was a good one to
try because the original made 3 pounds of bread.  I wanted to add more
fiber, so I substituted whole wheat flour and wheat germ for some of the
white flour.  By using only 3/4 cup of WW flour, I left room in the machine
for the shredded wheat, gluten flour, and wheat germ.  I used slightly more
than half the original amount of honey, but omitted the sugar.  The amount
of butter is slightly more than half the original amount because I like the
flavor and texture it gives, but you could reduce it to 1 1/2 tablespoons
if you like.  The first time I made this in the machine, I had to increase
the amount of water slightly, so the machine recipe has a bit more than
half as much water as the original.

These have become two of our favorite breads in the machine.  I make them
more often now than in the past, because both were rather sticky and
difficult to handle when made by hand.  Converting your "old favorites" is
definitely worth the effort!

if you like.  The first time I made this in the machine, I had to increase
the amount of water slightly, so the machine recipe has a bit more than
half as much water as the original.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ABM-100/300/350:
  1                Pkg  yeast
  3               Cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           Tsp  salt
  1                Cup  water -- 80 deg
  2        tablespoons  oil -- 80 deg


SETTING: White Bread / MANUAL

Enjoy a soft crusty pretzel warm from the oven with mustard or butter.

After the machine has completed  the second rising, it  will beep.  Remove  the
dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide into 4 parts.  Divide each fourth
into 3 pieces.   Roll  each piece  into an  18-inch rope.   Shape  rope into  a
circle, overlapping about 4 inches from each  end and leaving ends free.   Take
one end in each hand  and twist to the point  where dough overlaps.   Carefully
lift ends across to opposite  edge of circle.  Tuck  ends under edge to make  a
pretzel shape; moisten  and press ends  to seal.   (Clear, huh?   :-) Place  on
greased cookie sheets.  Let rise, uncovered, until puffy, about 20 minutes.

In a 3-quart stainless  steel or enameled saucepan,  combine 2 quarts of  water
and 1/3 cup baking soda; bring to a boil.  Lower 1 or 2 pretzels into saucepan,
simmer for 10  seconds on  each side.   Lift  from water  with slotted  spoon.
Return to greased  cookie sheet.   Let  dry briefly.   Brush with  1 egg  white
slightly beaten.  Sprinkle with coarse salt or sesame seeds.

Bake at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.

  2               Cups  flour -- (2 to 2 1/2)
  1                Tsp  salt


Knead, form and let rise (probably several hours). (I actually pull the dough out as soon as the kneading is finished and don't let the machine got through the rising and rounding cycles.)

The critical thing of course is "How much flour?" and the answer is "You will have to determine that by consistency 5 minutes into the kneading and adding flour or water as necessary".

Just recently I bought a new bag of flour, same brand, same store, and the amount of flour I needed shifted by 1/4 cup for a loaf of bread. I suspect the reason was the 'vintage' of the flour changed.

A couple of things really kill you in making sourdough full cycle in bread machine --

1. The unknown (and probably varying) amount of water and flour in the starter.
2. The activity of the starter.

You can of course set up a regime to have a known amount of water and flour in the starter but there are only a couple of starters that are active enough (Russian and Saudi from Sourdoughs International) to produce a reasonable bread using full cycle in a bread machine.  Even these starters have about 1/2 the activity of a commercial yeast that the bread machine timers assume -- so you tend to get a dense loaf.

>From: Darrell_Greenwood@mindlink.net (Darrell Greenwood)
there is a book, World Wide Sourdoughs for Your Bread Machine (see URL:<http://mindlink.net/darrell_greenwood/sourdoughfaqs.html> under Books for additional information) that covers bread machines and sourdoughs quite well using three techniques.

Combine above in order your bread machine prefers.  Bake on french bread setting.

Makes 1 largish loaf

BTW: I use only whole grain in my starter, so if yours uses white, you can adjust the amounts accordingly in the recipe. The original recipe called for mixing some flour, water, and the starter and lettting it sit 4-12 hrs. I use fairly well-fed starter and so I skip this wait without much perceived difference.

                  ****

I refrigerate my starter in a wide-mouth mason jar (with one tiny hole
punched in the lid), and keep it at about 0.75 to 1 cup in size.

Stir, then warm starter into activity.
	(my "warmer" is the oven with the light on)
feed 0.5 cup flour and enough water to bring back to batter consistency.
	(leave in warmer)
When fully active, return starter amount to `fridge.
	(for me, this can be two to ten hours)
The rest now goes in (glass) mixing bowl.
Immediately add half the flour (1.25 c "Better for Bread" flour)
	and some water - enough to a thin dough texture -
	almost, but not, to a batter.
Cover bowl with slightly damp towel, leave in warmer.
	(sometimes I turn out the light)
Wait at least until "sponge" stage - bubbles are visible in the glass
	(time varies a LOT, this can be 2 to 24 hours, and
	 the whole thing can probably fail at this point, so
	 experience which I cannot relate is probably
	 important in preparing and watching this stage)
Throw in machine with:
	1.25 cups more flour
	0.75 tsp salt
	1.5 to 2 tsp sugar
	water - maybe 0.25 cup to start, then add by teaspoon
	 during the first mixing cycle to achieve an even
	 dough that's not too tough for the motor.
Follow subterfuge described above to get 24-hour rise time
*without* having the machine manipulate dough just before baking.

My machine is a DAK, first model.  I use the 'french" setting and turn
the browing control all the way up.  (those hints, and in fact the
above "recipe," evolved from a DAK recipe book)

Alternatively, at the flour/salt/sugar stage, I put yeast in the
machine (before anything else) and I use a little less than the
amount in a packet (I buy it in a small brown jar).  Then I can
just set the automatic cycle and ignore it until done.

I have yet to manage really good texture without yeast.
The closest I've come took even more work, kneading the dough
slightly, somewhere in the middle of the 24 hour rise time.

use the Sourdough French Bread recipe and the
Sourdough starters (basic) recipe

 This one combines three of my favorite things: sourdough, chiles,
and my bread machine.  Make the dough as above, adding two 4-oz. cans of
chopped chiles (or better yet fresh chiles).  I also like this recipe made
into about a dozen rolls.

  1                Cup  Sourdough Starter
  1                Tbl  Sugar

Yields 1 Loaf

Add all the ingredients to the pan in the sequence listed.
Select "French Bread".
Press "Start".
Slowly drizzle the water into the machine while it is running.
Add water until the dough forms a rough ball which cleans the sides of the
pan.
If there is a wet smear under the dough paddle, slowly add flour until the
smear is gone.
Let the dough knead for a few minutes.
There should be no wet smear under the dough paddle and the dough should have
a slightly tacky feel to it (your finger should come away clean).
If the dough feels dry instead of slightly tacky, add a just a few drops of
water.
NOTE: You may replace  1/2 cup of bread flour with  1/2 cup of rye flour
and add 1 teaspoon of caraway seed to make a sourdough rye bread.

Make the batter the night before.  This is done by taking 3/4 cups of the

out overnight.  What is not used the next morning, can be tossed back into
the starter.  To finish the job, just toss all of the ingredients into the
machine and enjoy.  (Note: I usually use the "french bread" setting on my
Welbuilt, but I don't think it is critical.)

Having raised this question before, I feel entitled to brag--I finally
did it!  After years of occasional attempts with various starters, I
got a nice well-risen loaf out of my original model DAK yesterday.  I
have no idea what caused the success, but I suspect it is that I have
never before run a starter as long as my current one (two years; it's
a mixture of potato water and bread flour *only* in equal proportions
fed with plain water and flour when used), and perhaps it's just now
up to full strength.  I used this recipe:
    3 c. King Arthur white flour
    1 1/2 cup starter
    2 teaspoons sugar
    2 tablespoons oil
    1/2 teaspoon salt
I had the starter out on top of our hot water heater for about 20
hours before I started the bread.  My starter is quite liquid; your
proportions of flour to starter may well be different (I had a bunch
of flops until I found these proportions worked for me), and you may
need to add water if your starter is thick.  I used the good old
regular cycle.  I bring this all up only for those who may, as I did,
have had the ambition to make a real sour dough bread at least once.

  1                cup  skim milk

  1                cup  flour

Warm a quart jar or similar container by filling it with hot tap water and letting it sit for a few minutes. Heat the skim milk to 110 degrees, remove from the heat and stir in the yogurt.
 Drain the water from the jar and wipe it dry.
 Pour the milk - yogurt mixture into the jar and cover it.  Plastic lid recommended.  I rubber banded a piece of plastic wrap over the top. Place the mixture in a warm place and let it proof for 24 hours.  For my warm place I placed the jar on top of
 the stove near a pilot light for the burners.
 Stir in the flour.  Cover and leave in a warm place for three to five days.  Mine was ready in 3 days. At the end of the period the starter
should be bubbly and about the consistency of pancake batter.  When it
 has reached this point put it 1 in the refrigerator for storage.
At this point I went directly to the starter batter recipe - so I
didn't refrigerate the starter first.

The batter should have the consistency of light pancake batter. Cover the bowl lightly ( I used a dish towel held on by a small notebook) and let it proof for 8 to 12 hours in a 85 to 90 degree area. After proofing use what batter you need for your bread. ( It can stay out for up to 3 days)  Make sure you save
at least 1 1/2 cups to replenish your starter. Return the remaining batter to the starter jar.  Stir and refrigerate.

How to dry and restart a culture
from dadams@cray.com (David Adams)

Drying:

For long term culture storage, store your culture in dried powder
form.  Ed Woods book doesn't tell you how to do this right out, but I
sort of discovered it on my own.  Actually I believe it is an old
trick.

Spread a three foot long section of wax paper on the  Table WAX SIDE
UP.  Smear one tablespoon of fresh culture around evenly and  thinly
over the surface of the wax paper.   Let it  dry overnight, and then
scrape the dry flakes into a bowl and crunch them (Mortal & pestle
style) into small pieces.  Put the powder into a labeled zip lock bag
and press the air out.

The culture forms spores when it starts to dry out. The culture will
store in a zip lock bag at normal temperatures like this for 6 months.
It will store even longer in the frezer.

I find that a zip-lock bag is very convenient way to carry a culture
when traveling or moving.  Make sure the bag is labled and don't
flaunt those little bags of white powder!

I find it convenient to do several sheets of wax paper at once.  Then
when friends ask for a start I spoon two teaspoons into a new bag, and
carry it to work, or where ever I will see them next.

Another reason I find this convenient is that if you own several
different cultures, they don't all have to occupy a bottle in the
fridge at once.

And it is fairly easy to include a small zip-lock with a teaspoon or
two of start in a letter.  An easy way to share starts.

Restarting:

Dr. Wood recomends the following steps for activating dried sourdough
cultures:

Mix a couple of teaspoons of the dried powder with  1/2 cup of water
at 95 to 100 deg F.  Mix briefly and let stand for 15 min.  Add 1/3
cup of white bread flour, mix well and proof for 24 hours at 85 deg.
F. (My start needs 12 hours.)  "The jar lid should not be tightened.
During the first 12 hours the  culture should be stirred once or twice
as convenient.

"At the end of 24 hours the culture should start to  bubble but the
time varies depending on which culture is to be activated.
Regardless, add an additional 1/2 cup of 85 deg. F. water and 1/2 cup
of flour.   Then stir vigorously to whip some air into the mixture.
Return it to your warm place for 12 hours.  When the culture has a
layer of foamy bubbles on the  surface, it is ready to use.

Some of the cultures will fully activate in 24-48 hours, but some may
require 3 to 5 days.  During this time, keep the culture at 85 deg.
F., add water and flour at about 12 hour intervals and stir briskly."

  4        Tablespoons  Milk -- (or buttermilk)
  2        Tablespoons  sugar


Combine all ingredients in a glass bowl and allow to stand in
a warm place for a few days (or maybe a week).  The starter will smell
wonderfully sour and be about the consistancy of pancake batter when
the fermentation gets going.

To feed my starter, I always add equal parts of milk and flour
along with a "scoop" of sugar (about 1/4 cup per cup of milk and flour).
I find that it is the sugar that really determines how quickly the starter
recovers after a feeding.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  active dry yeast -- (I use rapid-rise)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5 1/2           cups  bread flour -- (5 1/2 to 6)
  2               cups  warm water
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2 1/2      teaspoons  water

Makes 16 rolls

In large mixing bowl, combine yeast, salt, and 5 cups flour.  On low speed,
mix until blended.  Add honey and 2 cups of warm water.  With flat beater,
mix approximately 2-3 minutes until mixture becomes thick.  Change to dough
hook, and continue kneading for approximately 7 minutes, adding remaining
flour in 1/2-cup increments during first 4 minutes of kneading.  Place dough
in greased bowl; turn greased side up.  Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch down; cover and let rise 15-20 minutes more.

Divide dough into 16 equal parts.  Shape each part into oblong, about 5
inches long.  pinch ends to form points.  Place on greased baking sheets.
Make slash about 3 inches long and 1/2-inch deep the length of the roll.
Cover and let rise until doubled, 40-60 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 375
degrees Fahrenheit.

Mix together cornstarch and 2-1/2 tsp. water; brush gently on rolls.  Bake
until rolls are golden brown, about 35-40 minutes.  Serve warm.

NOTE:  these rolls freeze very well.

                        (if using  Fleischmann's may need more)


Original recipe called for 2 T butter or margarine instead of Wonderslim.

I use the standard bread cycle, light crust setting.

This loaf is milder than whole wheat, but has more character than
white bread.  If you choose to use whole wheat flour (which I think
would overwhelm the flavor of the spelt), you would need to add a
little gluten to help the rise -- maybe one rounded tablespoon.

I originally had put a little gluten in the above recipe and it came
out a little too light.  This further confirmed my belief that spelt
must have a good gluten content.

I used the standard white-bread cycle.

Thanks to help from Ann Miner and Susan Chapin, I baked a palatable
loaf of spelt bread this week. It tastes and smells very much like
whole wheat bread, but somewhat milder. I liked it. My three-year-old
son ate it without remark, but the eight-year-old refused to try
it. My wife doesn't care for whole-wheat bread, and didn't care for
this, either.

                 *****

You can use an very small amount if you give it time to multiply. This
is a sponge method of making bread that I am just trying out and it is
producing raves from the family.

1/2 tsp of yeast, half your flour, all your liquid, your sugar. Mix for
5 minutes and reset the bread machine and let sit for a couple of hours
(this is the sponge and the yeast are multiplying quite nicely at this
point).

Add  the rest of the ingredients (in my case flour, 1 tsp salt (flavor,
dough conditioner), 1 tbs oil (dough conditioner, anti-staling), 80mg
vitamin C (dough conditioner)), restart the machine and process for
dough. Put in bread pan, let rise and bake. Result, in my case, more
flavor and a chewier texture.

Sift 4 cups flour with baking powder and salt. Combine milk and melted fat.
Place flour mix in a large bowl and add the liquid ingredients, a little at a time, beating them in at first with an egg beater. When the 4 cups have been worked to a soft dough, lightly flour a board with part of the remaining
flour. Knead dough lightly, working in the flour. Divide the dough into 3 parts and shape each into a round about 1/8" thick of a diameter to fit the sikllet you plant to fry in. Pour oil into heavy skillet about 1/4" deep.
Heat oil and brown breads quickly, one at a time until golden on both sides.
(This is obviously a modernized version )

(makes 3 flat, round loaves, about 10" in diameter, 1/2" thick)

ABM.  I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds great.  Hope you enjoy it.

                International Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  raisins -- optional
  5               Cups  flour -- sifted
  1                Cup  candied fruit -- mixed
  1           Teaspoon  lemon peel
     1/4      Teaspoon  mace
     1/2           Cup  sugar
  1                Cup  chopped almonds
  2                     Eggs
     1/4           Cup  orange juice
     1/2           Cup  milk
  1                Cup  butter
  2        Tablespoons  sugar
  1            Package  dry yeast
     1/2      Teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           Cup  warm water
                        Creamy frosting

Combine raisins, if used, candied fruits, lemon peel and mace with orange
juice. Allow mixture to stand, covered, about one hour or overnight
refrigerated.

Sprinkle yeast on warm water; stir to dissolve. Meanwhile, scald milk;
add 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter. Cool to lukewarm. Add
2 cups flour, eggs and yeast to milk mixture. Beat with electric
mixture on medium speed for two minutes. Stir in fruit mixture and enough
remaining flour, a little at a time, to make a dough that leaves the sides
of the bowl and that can be handled easily.

Turn onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and satiny, about 5
minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl; turn dough over to grease top. Cover
and let rise in warm place until doubled, about two hours.

Punch down dough; turn onto surface, knead a few times and divide in half.
Cover and let rest five minutes. Roll each half into a 15 x 9" oval.

Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter; brush part of it over each oval, saving
what is not used for frosting. Sprinkle with two tablespoons sugar mixed
with cinnamon.

Fold each oval lengthwise in half to make a big Parkerhouse roll. Carefully
lift folded-over rolls to a greased baking sheet and curve the ends slightly.
Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Bake in moderate oven 350 degrees F. about 35 minutes, or until
loaves are golden. While hot, brush with Creamy Frosting and decorate with
colored sprinkles.

Makes two large loaves.

Creamy Frosting: To 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar add 1
tablespoon cream or milk and 1/4 cup melted butter. Stir until smooth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            tsp  yeast
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  almond paste
                        finely grated rind of two oranges
     1/2         stick  butter -- (2 ounces), melted
  1              large  egg
  4        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  pecans -- (3 ounces)

Place all the ingredients except the pecans in the machine.  Program for
dough, adding the pecans at the very end of the final knead cycle.
To complete:
1/2 stick (2 ounces) sweet butter, melted
1/2 cup confectioners sugar, for dusting
    At the end of the final rise, punch down the dough and transfer it to a
lightly floured work surface.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for
1 hour or until doubled in bulk.  With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll
the dough into a 14" long oval.  Brush the surface of the doughwith some of
the melted butter and fold it in half, lengthwise.  Press lightly on the fold
of the dough, pressing toward the open edges.  Do not press the outer edges
together.  Transfer the shaped dough to a greased and floured baking sheet,
cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 30-40 minutes or until double
in bulk.
    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees with the rack in the center position.
Bake the stollen for 30-35 minutes or until lightly brown.  Remove from the
oven and immediately brush with the remaining melted butter and then dust
generously with the confectioners sugar.

You can make the doough in a (large) bread machine, in the food
processor or in the mixer (and of course by hand...)  Lora Brody

That's it.  Dump it all in and turn it on.  The raisins are for
moisture and flavour, so the should get all chopped up (sometimes it
helps to dice them a bit before you put them in).  Best of all , this
is healthy, and perfect for setting on timer.

     3/8           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1 1/2           Tbsp  honey
  1                     egg
  1 1/2            tsp  yeast
  3               cups  bread flour
     1/2           tsp  salt
     1/2           tsp  cardamom
     1/2           tsp  grated orange peel
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1                     egg yolk
                        --or whole egg for glaze

This is a single, 1-1/2 pound bread-machine loaf that is fancier if
baked free-form.  Mostly, I've baked it for family gatherings; not
much at other times. It's deliciously sweet, great for breakfast.  The
instructions are for a Hitachi B201.

*Note: Include the orange zest soaking water.  I also prefer
potato water -- the water left over from boiling potatoes.

You'll need the zest (the orange part of the rind) from several
oranges.  A zester can be used to cut off the zest.  Dry the little
strings overnight on a large plate.  Another method is to slice off
the orange part of the rind, trim off as much of the white stuff as
possible, then julienne the orange zest.

Soak the dried orange zest in 2 ounces hot water for several minutes
until soft.  Drain the water into a measuring cup and add potato water
or tap water.  Add the zest at the same time as the flour.  Pick over
the raisins.

Crust:  Light
Menu Selection:  Mix Bread (this bakes the bread in the machine,
        allowing the raisins to be dropped in when it beeps), or Bread
        plus Knead and First Rise cycle.

If baking a free-form loaf using the Knead and First Rise cycle, add
the raisins 4 to 8 minutes minutes before the rise starts (set a timer
for 24 to 26 minutes).  Or knead them in before shaping the dough.

Divide the dough into two parts, 2/3 and 1/3 of the total.  Separate
each part into 3 pieces (total, 6 pieces). Roll the three larger
pieces into 14 to 16-inch long "logs" and the three smaller pieces
slightly shorter and much skinnier.

Starting in the middle, braid the three parts together, first one end,
then the other.  Make two braids.  Pinch the ends of the braids and
tuck under slightly to make sure they don't open up while rising or
baking.

Place the larger braid on a greased cookie sheet.  Then the smaller
braid on top of the larger.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
rise until doubled.  After the rise, brush the top with egg yolk for a
dark glaze, or a whole egg for a slightly lighter one.  Mix the
egg or yolk with a bit of water and a shake of salt.

Bake for 40 minutes at 350 F.  Cover with foil after 15 minutes, even if
the crust looks light.

BREAD-RYE - A sweet, dark whole-grain rye bread

This recipe comes from my great-grandmother, who emigrated from Sweden
and brought this recipe with her.  It makes a sweet, dark bread, and
(like most whole-grain breads) it tends to be a bit heavy.

(Makes 3 loaves)

PROCEDURE
(1)  Scald the milk and combine it with the water and brown sugar in a
very large bowl.  (You need something that holds at least 4 or 5 quarts.)
When the mixture is lukewarm, dissolve the yeast in it, then stir in 2 cups
rye flour and 1 cup white flour to make a paste.

(2)  Let the mixture rise in a warm place until it is light and foamy.  This
usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour.  Check it frequently-it can really
make a mess if it rises enough to overflow the bowl.  (I'm sure they could
make a great horror movie about a gigantic blob of bread dough that keeps
getting bigger and bigger as it consumes everything in its path....)

(3)  Stir in the granulated sugar, oil, molasses, anise seed and salt, and
enough flour to make a stiff dough, using 2 parts rye to 1 part white.  Knead
the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, adding more
flour to keep it from sticking to your hands.

(4)  Clean and grease the bowl.  Put the dough in the bowl, turning it to grease
all sides.  Cover the bowl loosely with a clean towel and let the dough rise until
it's doubled in bulk.  Punch it down and let rise until double again.


(5)  Divide the dough into three loaves and put in greased pans.  (I usually make
round loaves and bake them on cookie sheets.)  Cover with the towel and let rise
until double again.

(6)  Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 deg. F.  Because of the high sugar content,
this bread can burn rather easily; watch it closely so it doesn't get too dark.

NOTES
Rye flour can be a little hard to find these days.  You may have to visit a store
that specializes in natural foods.  Avoid the kind that is very coarsely ground
with big chunks of bran in it, though; this doesn't seem to have any gluten
at all in it, and since the proportion of rye flour is so high in this recipe,
the texture of the bread will come out all wrong.  You need something that looks
more like ordinary flour.

RATING
Difficulty: moderate.  Time: 30 minutes preparation, several
hours rising, 1 hour baking and cooling.  Precision: measure
the ingredients.

Hope these are what you're looking for.
Another suggestion is if you happen to have an old recipe
for making Swedish Limpa by hand, I'm sure Linda Rehberg co-author
of Bread Machine Magic will be happy to convert it to a bread machine
recipe for you. She and her partner Lois Conway are both so nice,
I'm sure if you have any abm problems, either would be happy to help.

NOTES : Dry buttermilk can be found in the baking section .
       I have left out the cheese when making this bread and it is still
       very good. I did have to add a little more flour at the time the
       bread is kneading. If it looks to sticky just add about 1/2 a
       teaspoon.

  1 1/2      Teaspoons  dry yeast


 Teff is a very tasty grain used for thousands of years in
 Ethiopia. It is easily the tiniest grain I have ever seen and
 adds a delicious character to bread.

*NOTE (if both are available, try using some flour and some whole grain.
The total amount should still be 3/4 cup.)

 When set on a 13-hour cycle, the center collapses and makes a
 very dense loaf.

 Variation:

 2-1/4 cup flour
 1/4 cup poppy seed } excellent loft
 1/4 cup bran
 1/4 cup millet

  1 1/2            Tsp  Yeast

Until now I never had any bread recipes that I felt were
outstanding enough to post to the bread list.  Today that all
changed!  I have just made the most incredible sandwich
bun/hamburger bun/frankfurter rolls recipe!
I've been searching and searching for a good sandwich bun recipe
for quite a while now.  Everything I made up until now has been
unacceptable.  Many recipes tasted too sweet, too chewy, or too
dry to make truly versatile buns.  I've finally found a bun
recipe that gives me light, flakey buns with just a light bread
taste so as not to disguise the flavours of the sandwich or
hamburger.  Here it is (Hitatchi breadmaker large "loaf"):

Throw everything in the breadmaker and set to "dough".  When
dough cycle is finished, turn the dough out onto a very lightly
floured kneading surface and knead just enough to expel air.
Form into a ball, cover with a towel, and let rest 10 minutes.

To make hamburger or sandwich buns, halve the dough and refrigerate
one piece, wrapped in plastic, to prevent it from rising too much as
you shape the first half.  Roll out the remaining half of the dough
1/2 inch thick and cut into rounds.  For large buns use a canning-jar
screw band (3 1/2 inches across); for medium buns use a large sized
biscuit cutter (2 3/4 inches across).

Place the rounds of dough on a lightly greased baking sheet about
1 inch apart.  Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled
while you roll and shape the second half of the dough into
more buns.

To shape into frankfurter rolls, roll the whole dough into a sheet
1/2 inch thick by 15 inches long by 8 inches wide.  With a sharp
knife or a pastry wheel, trim the edges and divide the dough
crosswise into 3 sections each about 5 inches long.  Cut each section
into 6 streps aobut 5 inches long and 1 1/4 inches wide.

Flatten each dough strip until it is 2 inches wide and fold it
firmly in half lenghtwise, with the seam at the side.  Round the
tips of the rolls with your fingers and lay them 1/2 inch apart
in rows on a greased baking sheet.  Leave an inch around the
edges of the pan and an inch between rows.

While the buns are rising, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Melt
some butter and brush the tops of the buns.  Bake them for 18 to
20 minutes for hamburger or sandwich buns (rounds) or 12 to 15
minutes for hotdog buns (longs).  The buns are done when the tops
and bottoms are a good golden brown.

If you like extra soft, tasty buns then brush them again with
butter and cool, covered with towels, on racks.  Makes about
10 large buns or 15 medium-sized ones.

That's it!  Happy burger flipping!

found in many old cookbooks. It is a light, honey colored bread. It will
sink a bit in the middle, but has a chewy crust and a sweet, very
satisfying flavor.

 From Joan's Kitchen

  Flour: the best flour to use for breads machines is
  bread or high gluten flour. This flour contains the
  proper amount of protein and gluten to allow for
  lengthy kneading, stretching and rising times without
  producing a small or collaspsed loaf.The loaf should
  be a good risier with a fine grain texture.

  Additional flour such as rye, oats, soy, cornmeal,
  wholewheat, rice etc. may be added to any recipe
  without increasing the size of the breads. These
  flours are deficient in gluten.( Except for whole
  wheat which ironically has sufficient gluten but has a
  sharp gluten structure which punctures and deflates
  the risen yeast cells ) You can sucessfully add 1 or 2
  cups of these flours to recipes which use 3 cups of
  bread flour.

  The lightest and highest loaves are ones made with
  white bread flour, eggs, and liquids such as milk or
  water. The smaller denser loaves are made with rye and
  whole wheat flour etc. These breads can even be made
  lighter if the flour is blenderized before using.
  Blenderized oatmeal also makes a lighter textured
  bread.

  The best bread machine cycle for denser loaves is the
  standard mode. the turbo or quick mode is excellent
  for for basic white, french, italian or light weight
  breads.Become familiar with cycles on your own machine.

  Humidity and temperature affect flour and the dough
  consistency may never be the same in repeated recipes.
  Let your eyes be your guide to know when to add more
  flour or water to the dough in the kneading cycle. the
  dough should be a smooth somewhat tacky dough when
  touched. However no dough should cling to your fingers
  when touched.Add flour or water if needed in small
  amounts gradually to get the proper consisitency.

  All ingredients should be lukewarm ( not hot ) when
  added to the recipe.People have the tendency to make
  the water much to hot for the bread machine.This
  activates the yeast too quickly, causing a poor
  textured loaf which may often collapse. Too hot water
  also may rupture the yeast cells and render them
  ineffective.Follow your machines instructions. If in
  doubt, 80 to 100 degrees may be sufficient.
  Temperatures over 110 F may be too hot.

  There are many bakers yeasts on the market. Red Star
  is reputed to make breads rise higher than Fleischmans
  yeast. SAF instant yeast ( French imported yeast )
  produces higher better textured bread using less yeast
  than called for in recipes. Judge for your self by
  experimenting.

  Ingredients which help improve texture , rising and
  character of bread:

  GLUTEN FLOUR or powder:  very high in protein and
  helps breads rise higher.You dont need this if using a
  good brand of bread or high gluten flour.The protein
  adds a nutritional boost to breads. Available in
  health food stores

  PURE BARLEY MALT SYRUP: A tablespoon or so also helps
  breads rise higher as the sugars feed the yeast.Found
  in health food stores

  LIQUID LECITHIN:  improves the textures of the breads,
  making it stay fresh longer. found in health food
  stores.

  VITAMIN C ( ascorbic acid ) crush a tablet or use it
  in powder form to help breads have a better texture
  and mellow gluten.

  FRESH LEMON JUICE: a few teaspoons also mellows the
  gluten and helps the texture of the bread making for a
  good keeper and riser.

  Other Miscellaneous tips for the breadmaker:

  Use bakers spray to spray the globe tops of bread
  machines in case your breads over rise and stick. This
  aids in cleanup!

  Use a small pastry or paint brush to sweep away the
  bread crumbs inside your machine and use a damp paper
  towel to pick them up. If your paddle sticks inside
  the bread, try using a  bakers spray on the paddle
  next time.

  Low fat products such as skim milk, egg beaters, light
  margarine low or non fat sour cream etc. work well,
  but the texture of the bread may  not be the same as
  for higher fat products.Bread may be denser and
  smaller.

  Bread that does not come out satisfactory may be use
  for breadcrumbs, bread pudding, bread dumplings or for
  the birds!

  A general safe ratio for breadmaking is: 3 cups bread
  flour, 1 1/4 cups liquid, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp sugar
  and 2 tsp yeast. Experiment from there. Decrease the
  total amount of liquids if added oil and eggs are used

  It pays to buy yeast and flour in large quantities if
  making a lot of bread. Store flour in a cool dry
  place. Yeast may be refrigerated.

  Cool breads at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before
  slicing.

  Any breads that dont seem  quite baked, place them in
  a conventional 35O oven for 10 minutes to finish
  baking,

  Eggs: when directions call for 1/2 of egg etc. just
  use one small egg.Normally in all baking large eggs
  are used.

  Too much garlic and cinnamon also decreases the power
  of yeast in a bread recipe.A small amount is okay when
  added directly with ingredients but dont go overboard
  if you are a garlic or cinnamon lover. Add the extras
  in the last kneading cycle.

More about Ingredients:
  SALT: is needed to control the activity of the yeast.
  You must use salt or your bread may overise, collapse
  and have a coarse uneven texture. Certain salt
  substitutes may work well to replace table salt

  SUGAR: sugar feeds the yeast and helps it grow.Too
  much causes the yeast cells to overmultiply and
  eventually collapse, casing a poor small product.
  Brown sugar easily repalces granulated white sugar. So
  does honey but reduce the amount of the liquid by the
  same amount of honey added. Sugar substitutes cannot
  replace the function of sugar.Sweet breads tend to
  brown darker. Use sweet bread cycle for breads with a
  lot of sugar, fats and eggs. Only add the amount of
  dried fruit specified as dried fruit does add some
  sugar to the dough.Usaully fruits and nuts are added
  at the "beep ". as they may not remain whole if added
  and mixed into the dough to early.

  Eggs: As I mentioned previously, 1 small egg equal 1/2
  of a large egg. 2 egg whites may be substituted for 1
  large egg.One egg should equal 1/4 cup. Use egg
  substitites as directed on the carton to replace eggs.

  FATS( oil, butter, margarine, mayo, crisco etc. ) are
  all dough enhancers. Fats condition the dough and keep
  breads fresher longer.Butter tends to cause a crisper
  crust, margarine a little tougher and solid vegetable
  shortening a little softer. When used in small amounts
  none of the above will cause a noticeable change in
  flavor.

  LIQUIDS: such as milk and water etc. activate the
  gluten, bind ingredients and add moisture.Milk
  produces a softer smoother bread texture and browner
  crust than water does.Dry powdered milk or buttermilk
  is an excellent chioce to add to breads.If you add 2
  tablespoons directly to the dry ingredients you need
  not necessarily alter the wet ingredients.

  HIGH ALTITUDE BAKING:Flour is dryer at higher
  altitudes and therefore will absorb more liquid.
  You'll need less flour in the recipe.Doughs also tend
  to rise faster at higher elevations. Therefore youll
  need less yeast, a bit more salt and a bit less
  sugar.Youll have to experiment with bread recipes to
  see what works for you.

is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye.  You can find it
in most health food stores.  It adds to the taste but not much to the
rising of bread.  In combination with wheat flour, it makes good bread for
sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but unobtrusive flavor.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
directions.

  Dissolve yeast in the warm water and add enough flour  to make a thick batter and cover and let rise double. this is called the " sponge '.Meanwhile In a large  bowl, beat butter and sugar very light and fluffy, about 20 minutes. Beat in the eggs ( except for 3  yolks ).Alternate adding flour and yoghurt and milk to egg/ sugar mixture and stir in the yeast mixture.   Enough flour should be added to make a non sticky dough. Knead smooth and elastic. Cover dough in a  large greased bowl and let rise double. Punch down and
let rise double again. Then shape as desired in pans  or in  braided rings. Let rise double and brush loaves with the reserved egg yolks. Sprinkle with seseme  seeds. Traditionally for easter, red colored hard cooked eggs may be pressed into the braided ring  before the 3rd rising. Baske in a 350 oven until golden, about 30minutes. loaves are light, sweet and  delicious. Note: recipe may be easily halved.

Yield: 5 loaves

the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is no longer sticky and
is smooth.

2.  Knead till smooth & elastic on a well floured board - 5 minutes.

3. Shape the dough into a rectangle, and divide into 12 smooth balls. Cover
with sliighly damp towels & let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

4 . Gently press each ball flat, keeping round shape.  With floured work
surface & rolling pin, roll each round to a 6 to 7 inch circle, paper thin.
 Cover with a slighly damp towel.

5.  Lightly oil a griddle or large skillet & warm over medium high heat until
hot. Gently stretch each round as thin as possible without holes as you place
it on the griddle.  Cook until browned, bubbly spots appear on the bottom,
about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and brown the other side.  Remove from the pan and
immediately wrap in a clean towel until cool enough to handle.  Serve warm or
at room temp.

6.  Repeat with all. Pan will have to be re-oiled after 3-4.  Do not add too
much oil or the pitas will be soggy and heavy.

The inquiry about Lebanese flat bread sent me back to the local library,
where I remembered seeing a book that might be of interest.

It is "Pita The Great" by  Virginia T. Habeeb. Workman Publishing, NYC, 1986

On pg 13, the author says,"The Lebanese marook is shaped by hand in much the
same manner as pizza, by tossing and stretching the dough until it is well
over a foot in size.  It is then flipped onto a concave shaped metal surface
set over a heat source where it bakes quickly in minutes.  The Armenians have
a similar bread, called lavash, which is baked to a cracker-like crispness
and measures anywhere from 5 to 20 inches."

Then on page 31 is a recipe for Unleavened Griddle-Baked Pita.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  Maple Syrup -- Real Not Fake
  1                Cup  Water -- 80 Deg F
     1/2           Cup  oat bran
     1/4           Cup  wheat bran
  2               Cups  Bread flour
     1/4           Cup  Sucanat
  1         tablespoon  Soy Milk -- Powdered
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yeast


If making rolls, set on dough cycle. When done, fashion into the shapes you want. Heat oven for 2 minutes, thenTURN IT OFF. Cover rolls with a moist kitchen towel. Place in oven for 20 minutes, or until doubled. Remove rolls from oven. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 20 minutes or until done.

Bread slicing tip: Let your bread cool for at least one hour or better overnight before cutting. I use a bread slicing rack with several slits and a special knife for slicing bread that costs about $4 -- money well spent!

I devised this recipe from several others and have made it for a few years.  It consistently comes out wonderfully in my bread machine (West Bend), and it makes great rolls, buns, and cinnamon rolls and pullaparts. It has an
exquisite though not overpowering flavor. I make my bread on basic and light color settings.

tsp. = teaspoon
Tbsp. = tablespoon

Add ingredients in the order required by your bread machine:

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 lb pound loaf: -- 1.5 lb loaf:
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast -- 2 teaspoons
  2               cups  whole wheat flour -- 3 cups
                        (or mixed with flour)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  gluten -- 2 tablespoons
  1           teaspoon  salt -- 1 1/2 teaspoons
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- 1 teaspoon
                 pinch  cayenne pepper -- 1/8 teaspoon
     1/2           cup  water -- 3/4 cup
                        -- or 2% milk
  1         tablespoon  honey -- 1 1/2 tablespoons
  2          teaspoons  minced dried onion -- 1 tablespoons
     1/3           cup  cooked vegetables, pureed -- 1/2 cup
                        carrots, broccoli, peas
                        or corn
                        Optional:
     1/4      teaspoon  liquid lecithin -- 1/2 teaspoon

    Put all ingredients in machine according to your manufacturer's
    specifications.  Select Basic Bread Cycle, light crust.  Be
    sure the vegetables are cooled.

Watch the water content on the vegetables for this one so that your dough
is not too wet.  You simply check the dough after the machine has been on,
at about the 5 minute level.  If the dough is too loose and wet, add more
flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it pulls from the side and lumps more
firm and smooth like it should.  Not a loaf recommended for the first time
user.

    This is one recipe I have really played with; and, with happy
    results.  It makes a great vegetable sandwich; a lovely compliment
    for soups, stews, or little teas sandwiches spreach with cream
    cheese and fresh dill/olive slice garnish.  Play with this one...
    some suggestions follow:

    *gluten additive     helps from dough elasticity  I don't use this.
                         If I want a higher loaf, I usually lower the
                         salt.  I found no need for gluten in this loaf.

   **oregano, dried      I love fresh herbs and personally use the 2
                         fresh to 1 dried conversions  Finely chop or
                         process fresh herbs in mill, processor or blender.
                         I have used basil or dill with wonderful results.

  ***onion, dry mince    I love fresh onions.  I normally use fine chopped
                         scallion (don't forget the stems), or white onions.
                         Be aware fresh ones might affect the shelf life of
                         this loaf.  I never have any left over after the
                         sandwich mentioned above. Makes my mouth water!
                         I have use the dried minced onion flakes.  You
                         get a slight crunchy texture.

 ****vegetable puree     To be honest this I have not done.  I did not want
                         a "colored" bread...but a "confetti bread".  The
                         pretty flecks of a fine dice broccoli/carrot and/
                         or corn is sooooooo pretty.  I carefully drain
                         the vegetables and pat very dry.  I then carefully
                         dice them down in the processor to look like
                         confetti bits.  You could use all green vegies,
                         cabbage or a fine chopped fresh spinach leaf.
                         be aware of your storage desires.  The puree would
                         last one or two days longer, I am sure.

*****Lecithin            I have never added this.  It acts as a preservative
                         in this application.  In health applications it
                         works on cholesterol and helps to break down fat
                         and stimulate bile secretion for your liver.  You
                         can buy capsules in your local food chain in the
                         vitamin section, or use granuals.  Both will work.
                         And, of coarse, there's the health food stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     yeast cake
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  cold water
  1                cup  milk -- scalded
  1         tablespoon  salt
  8               cups  flour

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.  When dissolved, add the
cold water to the scalded milk and stir into the yeast mixture.  Sift the
salt with the flour and gradually stir this into the milk-yeast mixture.
Knead well on a lightly floured board for about 10 minutes, or until
smooth and elastic.  Place in a buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until
doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.  Punch down and turn out again onto a lightly
floured board.  Knead again for 5 minutes.  Now shape the dough into 2
long or round loaves and place them on buttered cookie sheet that has been
sprinkled with cornmeal.  Make gashes in the top with a sharp knife, as for
French Bread.  Cover and let rise again until doubled.  Brush with
egg-white glaze and bake in a 450F oven for 10 minutes, lower heat to
350F and bake for 50 minutes longer.  Remove from oven, brush again with
glaze, and return to oven for another 30 minutes.  It is this long, long
baking that give the bread its distinctive flavor and crisp crust.

  2               cups  milk -- scalded
  1            package  dried granular yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  5               cups  flour -- (5 to 6)
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- melted
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     egg white -- slightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

You may, of coarse form this into loave(s) and bake as a loaf bread.

Cool scaled milk to lukewarm.  Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water and
add 1 tablespoon sugar.  Cover and set aside until foaming and doubled
in volume.  Add the foaming yeast to the lukewarm milk.  Add 3 cups
flour, one at a time, beating well for at least 10 minutes, or until the
mixture is very light and smooth.  cover and set aside in a warm place
until light and puffy.  Add the beaten egg, melted butter, slat and 2
tablespoons sugar, then slowly add just enough flour to make a soft
easy-to-handle dough.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board.  Knead at
least 10 minutes, using as little flour as possible on the board.  When
the dough is satiny smooth, and free from stickiness place in a warm,
well greased bowl.  Cover and set aside in a warm place until doubled in
bulk.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board and shape into small buns,
twists, and divided rolls (see below).  Place on a greased baking sheet,
cover and let stand until doubled.  Glaze with beaten egg white.  Bake
in a 375F to 400F oven for 15 mintues or until golden brown.

SMALL BUNS:  Shape into little balls.  Glaze with beaten egg yolk or egg
white.

TWISTS:  Cut off three small pieces of dough.  Roll each into pencil thin
ropes about 6 inches long.  Braid.  Pinch ends tightly.  Glaze with egg
white.

DIVIDED ROLLS:  Make small balls, then press down the handle of a wooden
spoon through the center of each ball, half way through, thus dividing
it.  Gently shape the ball so that it will be round, not flat.

CLOVER LEAF ROLLS:  Cut off three small pieces of dough.  Shape into three
small balls, then place three little balls together in well-greased muffin
tins.  Glaze with melted butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           Cups  walnuts -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                Cup  water -- 105-115 degrees
  2        Tablespoons  water -- 105-115 degrees
     3/4           Cup  basic bread sponge
  5        Tablespoons  honey
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  walnut oil
  2 3/4           Cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
     1/2           Cup  all-purpose flour -- for kneading
  1         Tablespoon  kosher salt
                        cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Try using maple syrup instead of honey.

Can use olive oil instead of walnut.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a baking sheet,
roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes.  Cool.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge, honey and oil into the water, breaking the sponge up
using your hands or a spoon.

Add 2 3/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding until
the dough gathers into a single mass.  Knead, in the bowl, until the dough
becomes soft and only slightly sticky, using the additional flour
gradually as necessary.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead the nuts into
the dough until they are evenly distributed.  Place the dough in a lightly
oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place on a
flour-dusted kitchen towel.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in
a draft-free location for two hours.

Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with cornmeal.  Gently press one of the
dough balls down on a lightly floured surface and then reshape into a
ball.  Do the same with the other risen ball.  Place both balls, with the
seams on the bottom, on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and
allow to rise until doubled, in a draft-free location.  This should take
2-3 hours.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking stone or
tiles on the middle rack to 425.   Place a baking pan with decent sides on
the bottom shelf.  Boil two cups of water.   Using a razor blade, make an
'X' in the top of each of the loaves.  Pour the boiling water into the
baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the loaves off the sheet and onto
the stone.

Bake for (20??) 30-35 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when
tapped on the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.

I just made this bread using peanut oil instead of butter and it probably
is one of the best breads I've made. It had good flavor and great texture.
It sliced very well and didn't fall apart like the bread can sometimes.

NOTES :  am allergic to wheat, but not to gluten, and I make many wonderful breads
by using 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten and 2 1/2 cups other flours.  Flours
I use include:  brown rice flour, barley flour, teff flour, oat flour,
oat flakes, soy flour, amaranth flour, quinoa flour, and many more,
including kamut flour.  Kamut is a wheat, and I can tolerate it, and I use
that as the basis for many of my breads.  Spelt is a wheat, also, but I
can't tolerate it at all.

Breads made without wheat flour tend to, not be softer exactly, but to
have a less chewy, resilient texture.  But they still make great
sandwiches, and the flavor can be as good as any wheat bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1              scoop  yeast -- (coffee scoop)
  1         tablespoon  oil -- optional
  1 1/2           cups  water

Put about 3 cups of flour in the bowl of the Cuisinart, add about 2 T
of sugar, 1 1/2 t. of salt, and (over the sugar, not the salt) sprinkle
about 1 small coffee scoop of yeast (probably about 2 T). If you use no
oil or want a fat-free loaf, close the Cuisinart lid at this point. If
you'd like a loaf that will last a little longer, add about a T of oil.
Then close the lid and have about 1 1/2 cups of water handy in a
measuring cup or a vessel with a good thin pouring spout. Start the
Cuisinart and slowly add in the water in a thin stream until the dough
forms a ball and starts to slam around the bowl. If it is too thin, the
dough will work up under the shaft (I always use the steel blade and NOT
the plastic one), so watch what is going on inside. Also, do not use
warm water, since working the bread in the machine will warm up the
whole dough and you can kill the yeast if it gets too hot. If you start
getting the dough too wet, stop and add another T or two of flour and then
start the machine again.

Anyway, after you have a rather soft, but not sticky dough running around
the machine, let the machine run for about 30 or 40 seconds. Feel of the
bowl with your hand to be sure that it is not too hot in there. Then
just turn off the machine and wait until the dough rises up to the top
of the bowl. Turn out and form into a loaf and put in a greased loaf
pan or finish a little more with your hand kneading and then put into
any shape you want (even bagels or baguettes). Bake and enjoy. About
400 degrees until golden brown. I always cool on a rack so that it
doesn't sweat.

                        --1 1/2 pound loaf:
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Active dry yeast

  3               cups  Whole wheat flour
  2          teaspoons  Salt

  1                cup  warm water

If you don't like making bagels but want the texture of bagels with the low-fat
nutritional benefits; try this bread. It tastes like a bagel and is especially
good sliced and toasted.

There is one note for the Panasonic/National machines and that is to use 3 tsp
yeast for 1 1/2 lb loaf.  I believe that this is for the older  Panasonics as I
do remember Linda Rehberg saying that the newer models came out after their
book was published and that the yeast amounts in her book  were not for the
newer Panasonics. Upon re-reading I found I missed one thing. I did add a few
more tsps of water as the dough ball was not forming to my liking.  Let me know
if you make this and how you like it.

SETTING: White Bread / MANUAL

The pleasant blend of whole wheat and bananas will fascinate the  bagel-fancier
and provide a base for many toppings.

After the machine has completed  the second rising, it  will beep.  Remove  the
dough and divide into 4 parts.  Divide  each fourth into 3 pieces.  Shape  each
piece into a smooth ball.  Punch a hole in the center with a finger and  gently
pull dough to make a one or two-inch hole.

In a 3-quart saucepan, combine 2 quarts water and 2 tablespoons sugar; heat  to
boiling.  Place a  few bagels at a  time in boiling water.   Simmer 3  minutes,
turning once.   Remove with  slotted spoon.   Place on  greased cookie  sheet.
Brush tops with  1 egg  white slightly beaten;  sprinkle with  poppy or  sesame
seeds.  Bake 375 degrees for 20 minutes.

  2        tablespoons  yeast
  2               cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  honey -- molasses, or sugar
                        (2 to 4)
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/4           cup  oil
  3                     eggs
  6               cups  whole wheat flour -- (6 to 8)


Hi, I'm fairly new here, and thought it was time to come out of lurk mode!
I've had great success making a whole wheat bread based on a recipe from
"Whole Foods for the Whole Family." Here's how I make it:

Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 t. honey. After it bubbles up, add
remaining honey, salt, oil, and 3 c. of flour. Beat by hand 200 strokes
(this strengthens the gluten and makes the bread rise more easily). Add 1
more cup of flour and beat briefly.

Now you have the "sponge." Cover bowl and let sponge rise for about an hour
until doubled in bulk(I put the bowl on an old heating pad set on low, and
this works great).

Add eggs and remaining flour until a soft dough results. Knead for about
10-15 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until
doubled in bulk.
Punch down the dough, shape into two loaves, and put in two loaf pans. Let
rise until doubled, then bake in 350 degree oven for 35 minutes.

If you try this, let me know how it works.

  1         tablespoon  fructose

                        hard white winter wheat, it gives a
                        great light textured whole wheat loaf,
                        but I've tried good old hard red
                        wheat also with great results)
  1 1/2            tsp  active dry yeast

Program: 15 minutes first knead
         1:10 first rise
         20 minutes second knead
         30 minutes second rise

At the end of the cycle, the machine punches down the dough, and then, you
take it out, and shape it, put it on a pan, (or in a square pan if you just
can't give up the square shape), whatever you like, and let it rise for
about an hour, or until it doubles in size. Then, make your decorative
insisions, (That will make it look like those beautiful loaves from the
local baker) and bake it at 400 deg. for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust
is a golden brown.

The greatest part is, never again do you have to deal with a collapsed loaf!!
Why? Simply because if your loaf collapses, then reshape it, and let it rise
again. No matter what, you'll get decent bread out.

The programmable dough makers definitely are the next generation of bread
machines. They'll take off simply because they'll satisfy bread purists, and
heck, they're much cheaper than the full blown bread machines. But in the
meantime, as far as recipes are concerned, it's still the pioneering age for
these things.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  15              cups  whole wheat flour -- (to 16 cups)
  5               cups  hot water -- (95-105F)
     1/2           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  yeast -- Fermipan
                        (if using another brand 2 1/2 - 3T)
     1/3           cup  oil
  1         tablespoon  salt

This is really a very basic recipe - and since I have made ww bread for so many years using many different dough enhancers, etc., I can only conclude that what makes this recipe so consistently great, is the particular wheat and perhaps the brand of yeast.

I grind my own wheat which is Hard White Spring Wheat from Montana and I use Fermipan Yeast.  When I got this recipe from an acquaintance last year I asked her what her brands she used of everything in the recipe and this is exactly what I am sharing with you.  It is a lighter colored wheat bread and has a wonderful flavor that does not leave a bitter sort of aftertaste that I have experienced with my previous brand.

I grind up 15-16 cups of flour first.  Then I pour into my Kitchen Aid
mixing bowl:

	5 cups hot (95-105 degrees) water
	1/2 cup honey (any brand will work)
	2 Tblsp Fermipan Yeast
	  (If using another brand, you might try 2 1/2 - 3 Tblsp)

  Let this sit for a few minutes to "proof" - it will begin to "grow"
and will look bubbly and foamy.

Add.....5 cups of the whole wheat flour and mix for 1 minute.

Add.....1/3 cup oil (any good vegetable oil)
	1 Tblsp salt
	Mix together another 1 minute

Add.....7-9 cups of flour, until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.

Knead and rise as usualy for any basic bread dough.

This will make 3 very large loaves or 4-5 smaller pan size loaves or
it is fun to make 12 of the very small loaves (maybe 2 1/2 x 3" pans)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                 oz  white bread flour
  10            ounces  whole-wheat flour
  1 1/4           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  yeast
  1         tablespoon  malted milk
     1/2           cup  oats
  2        tablespoons  powdered milk
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oil

Preset machine to WW regular about 15 min before sponge is mixed.
Sponge: Warm water, yeast (sprinkled on top, mixed in) with 4oz bread flour
with about 1/4 cup ww flour.  Pour into machines basket.
Put in flour next followed by rest of ingredents.
Rise time for sponge is about 15-20 min.

"I thought the texture of the white bread was a tad too course.
So I tried making a sponge with the water, about 4oz of flour, 1 Tbs malt
and yeast.  Let rise 15min, pour in and add rest of ingredients.  Worked
like a charm.  Very light and fluffy with even, small holes.

In moving to a more whole wheat bread, I've tried to use the same
technique, but with the whole wheat setting.  This has a 30 min rest before
mixing the ingredients and lets the bread rise/rest three times.  I let the
sponge rise 15 min by choosing the WW setting ahead of time."

I retrieved this from the Fat Free archive where I posted it in '94.
Didn't know if Linda or Lois would post it, as noted it is from their
book. But it is great! It may have been adjusted to eliminate oil and
dairy. I've also done variations with molasses and honey for the
sugar. Don't know how well they would keep, they never last long
enough to find out.

To Debbie:
  Here's our favorite hamburger bun recipe.

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select "dough" setting,
and press "start".

Once dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep.
Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out
dough onto a floured counter top or cutting board.  Gently
roll and shape the dough into a 12-inch rope.

For 1 1/2-pound:  With a sharp knife, divide dough into 8
pieces for hamburger buns or 12 pieces for hot dog buns.

For 1-pound:  With a sharp knife, divide dough into 6 pieces
for hamburger buns or 8 pieces for hot dog buns.

Grease a cookie sheet.  Roll pieces of dough into balls and
flatten for hamburger buns or shape into 6-inch long rolls
for hot dog buns.  Place on prepared cookie sheet. Cover and
let rise in warm oven 10 to 15 minutes until almost doubled.
(Hint: To warm up oven slightly, turn oven on "warm" for two
minutes, then turn it off, place covered dough in oven to
rise.)

Preheat oven to 400~F.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes until golden
brown.  Remove from oven and cool on racks.  When ready to
use, split buns in half horizontally.  These will keep in a
plastic bag in the freezer for 3 to 4 weeks.


1 1/2-pound yields 8 hamburger or 12 hot dog buns
1-pound yields 6 hamburger or 8 hot dog buns

I made
this last night in my old R2D2 Welbuilt and it handled the dough
pretty well. I used egg substitute and a teaspoonful or so of gluten
but otherwise followed the recipe and measured accurately. The top
was a bit sunken but the crust was nice and brown and thick for the
large size loaf. I used the white bread setting and set the dial for
the lightest crust.

  1                     Egg -- Beaten
  2               Cups  buttermilk
  3               Tbs.  Honey -- Or Molasses

I've had this recipe a long time. It makes a satisfying bread although it is essentially a quick bread. This is in response for a good non yeast bread.

  6                  C  Whole Wheat Flour -- To 8 C


I've had great success making a whole wheat bread based on a recipe from
"Whole Foods for the Whole Family." Here's how I make it.

Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 t. honey. After it bubbles up, add
remaining honey, salt, oil, and 3 c. of flour. Beat by hand 200 strokes
(this strengthens the gluten and makes the bread rise more easily). Add 1
more cup of flour and beat briefly.

Now you have the "sponge." Cover bowl and let sponge rise for about an hour
until doubled in bulk(I put the bowl on an old heating pad set on low, and
this works great).

Add eggs and remaining flour until a soft dough results. Knead for about
10-15 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until
doubled in bulk.
Punch down the dough, shape into two loaves, and put in two loaf pans. Let
rise until doubled, then bake in 350 degree oven for 35 minutes.

If you try this, let me know how it works.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk -- whole or skim
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  basil -- or favorite pesto
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- up to 1 tsp
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast

Load ingredients into machine, per manufacturer's instructions.  Use
 Quick bake cycle.

The bread is wonderful.  Simply use your favorite pesto recipe.  The
bread is beautiful green tint, as well.  It browns some, when cooking,
but the hint of green still remains.  Suggestions would be to add ground
walnuts or pine nuts.  The bread is a compact one.  Works well for either
the 1 pound or 1 1/2 pound machines.  No machine--I still suggest making
this one by hand.  Simply add additional flour, as needed.  I also seem
to remember, I increased the pesto to 4 tablespoons.  But I do like flavor.

  1                     yeast cake -- home-made
  1                cup  warm water
  1                cup  flour
                        cornmeal

Soften 1 home-made yeast cake in 1 cup luke-warm water.  Add about 1 cup flour, or enough to make a sponge dough.  Set in a warm place to rise until double in bulk; then stir in enough cornmeal to stiffen.  Cover board with a thin layer of cornmeal.  Onto this dump the mixture.  Form into a long roll about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and cut into cakes about 1/2 inch thick.  Dry in shade; then store in a flour sack, hung in a cool dry place.  The keep for a month or longer.

 HOW TO USE COMPRESSED YEAST:

  In using compressed yeast you may use double or even tripple the quantity
  of yeast given in your recipe in order to shorten time of fermentation.
  Be sure not to let your dough get too light at any stage of the procedure.

(In other words, don't let the dough go for too long a rise.  If you use
  this procedure and watch your dough texture/height, there is no reason
  why this should not work, and want the joy of doing it yourself.)

NOTES : This is from the Fredericksburg Home Kitchen Cook Book,
first published in 1846.  I Have the Centennial Edition, 1946.  Great
find, a bit pricey, in the book stalls.  There are two yeast recipes,
followed by a Buttermilk Bread recipe.  These are old recipes, but my
grandmother made her own yeast on the farm and followed the same procedure
in Iowa, turn of the century.

4.  Add buttermilk, cottage cheese, and oil to eggs and mix well.
5.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mix and beat on high speed for 3
to 5 minutes.
6.  Divide batter among the three prepared loaf pans.
7.  Place all the pans on one cookie sheet (for ease of handling) and bake
about 45 minutes.

This bread is not quite as sweet as the typical whole wheat bread with honey.
You can definitely taste the yogurt and the maple syrup.  It has a nice flavor
and is one of my favorites.

                           Zucchini Crust Pizza

                Pizza and Calzones              Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  zucchini -- coarsely grated
                        salt
     1/3           cup  flour
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     2/3           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil -- (2 to 3), minced
                        -- or- 1 tsp dried basil
                        salt and pepper
                        spaghetti sauce
                        your own toppings: peppers, onions,
                        mushrooms, anchovies

 Place zucchini in bowl and lightly salt.  Let sit for 15 minutes and
  squeeze out all the water that is rendered.  Roll in a towel and twist
  again.  This is to remove all possible water.  Mix with rest of
  ingredients in a bowl.  Spread on a well-oiled baking pan and bake in
  a 350F oven until top is dry and lightly browned (20 minutes).  Brush
  a little oil on surface and broil a few minutes--but don't burn.
  Spread with spaghetti sauce, 1 cup mozzarella, and any toppings.  You
  may, of coarse use your favorite cheeses.  Return to oven and bake at
  350F until done.  About another 20 minutes.

  I also just recently read that the smaller zucchini have the sweeter,
  better flavor.
