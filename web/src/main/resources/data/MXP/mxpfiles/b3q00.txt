  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        WET INGREDIENTS
  50                 g  butter -- melted (2 oz)
     3/4          cups  brown sugar
  1                     egg
  1 1/2           cups  mashed bananas -- 3 or 4
  1                tsp  vanilla
                        DRY INGREDIENTS
     3/4          cups  flour
     3/4          cups  wholemeal flour
     1/2          cups  bran -- (I use wheatgerm)
  2                tsp  baking powder
  2                tsp  cinnamon
                        OPTIONAL
     1/2          cups  walnuts -- chopped
     1/2          cups  sultanas
                        milk if needed

Mix all the wet ingredients together in one bowl. In another (large) bowl mix all the dry ingredients. Now add the wet lot to the dry lot and stir JUST UNTIL MIXED. If you beat away with mad abandon, it makes the muffins tough. Depending on how sloppy the bananas were, you may need to add 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk if the mixture is stiff. Bake in greased muffin pans (12 big or 24 smaller or 6 enormous) at 200 C, 400 F. 12 big ones take about 20 minutes. When they are done, the middle springs back when pressed.

NOTES : These are the BEST muffins I have tasted. They are lovely and moist. They freeze really well. All muffins are better when fresh, so freeze any that you are not going to eat the same day, and defrost in the microwave as you need them.

They are great for using up over ripe bananas (those ones you forgot about in the fruit bowl). I mash mine with a potato masher or you could use a fork - leave some lumps rather than pureeing them. The little banana lumps are lovely when cooked.....

NOTES : It's worth getting extra bananas when they are on sale for this bread. The bananas can be frozen until you get enough to use. This recipe is from "The Redbook Breadbook", published 1977

Bananas are ripest and bet when they are soft and heavily speckled - and just right for banana bread.

---
That banana bread recipe looks fabulous. I'm going to make it tonight. Did you know that if your bananas aren't ripe and soft, you can freeze them (I do it in ziplock bags) and when they defrost they're just right for making banana bread. [Blanche007@aol.com]

Categories    : Crackers                        Daily Bread Mailing List
                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/4           Tsp  Salt
  2               Tbsp  Butter Or Margarine
                        Softened, (1/4 Stick)
  1               cups  Milk -- Approx
                        Salt
                        For Tops -- Optional

These basic crispy crackers go well with soups, salads, dips, appetizers, and cheese. They will remind you of childhood rainy days and tomato soup.

Preheat oven to 325F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour and salt. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Slowly mix in enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional Tbsp of milk.

Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for roll the crackers paper thin. They will look almost translucent. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with salt and gently roll over the dough with your rolling pin.

With a sharp knife, carefully cut the crackers into 2" squares. Handling them gently, transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 - 25 min, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.

Yield: 95 - 100

Variations:
This basic recipe can be the starting pint for much interesting experimentation. Simply varying the flour or liquid can produce an entirely new cracker unavailable anywhere but in your kitchen.

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           Cup  beer
     1/4           Cup  stick margarine or butter
  3 1/2           Cups  bread flour -- divided
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      Teaspoon  salt
     1/2      Teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4      Teaspoon  ground red pepper
  1            Package  dry yeast
                        (About 2 1/4 Tsp)
  1              Large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1                Cup  shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese -- (4 Oz)
                        Cooking spray

This bread tasted wonderful on the first try.  I cut the butter amount in half, used 1/4 cup Egg Beaters instead of the egg and used fat free cheese.  Next time I will use only 1 tablespoon of butter and add more beer to adjust for the difference in liquid amount.  The bread disappeared so fast, in huge slices, that it didn't need the fat to retard spoilage.

1. Combine beer and margarine in a small saucepan; place over medium-low heat until very warm (120 to 130F).

2. Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife.  Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and the next 5 ingredients (1 1/2 cups flour through yeast) in a large bowl.  Add the beer mixture and egg, and beat at medium speed of a mixer for 2 minutes or until smooth.  Stir in cheese and 1 1/2 cups flour to form a soft dough.

3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.  Place in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85F), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

4. Punch dough down; cover and let rest 10 minutes.  Place in an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray.  Cover and let rise 40 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

5. Preheat oven to 375F

6. Bake at 375F for 20 minutes.  Cover with foil; bake an additional 20 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.  Yield: 16 servings (serving size: 1 slice).

Note.  Bread may also be cooked in a 1-quart souffle dish coated with cooking spray.  Cook at the same temperature for the same amount of time.

"A delicious dinner roll that is made from beer, honey, and a slight pinch of cinnamon.

Mix first 4 ingredients in a large bowl, and cut in the butter (cottage

and add to dry mix with blueberries.  Stir until just combined.  Place on
floured board or on cookie sheet sprayed with nonstick spray, and pat into
a circle 1 inch think.  Cut into wedges (8 or 10), separate slightly if on
cookie sheet, and if on board, transfer to prepared cookie sheet.  Bake at
450F for about 12 minutes until lightly browned.

****NOTE**** I like my scones a little sweet, so I would add 1/4 cup sugar
or a few tablespoons of honey next time.  These are more like biscuits in
taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        FILLING
  8             ounces  sultanas
  2             ounces  glace cherries -- roughly chopped
  1           teaspoon  mixed spice
  2             ounces  Demerara sugar
  1              ounce  melted butter
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1              ounce  ground almonds
                        SCONE MIX
  1              pound  self raising flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
                        good pinch    salt
  4             ounces  sugar
  4             ounces  butter or margarine -- cubed
  6       fluid ounces  milk - as needed -- more or less
                        ICING
  4             ounces  icing sugar
                        lemon juice
                        DECORATION -- halved
  12                    glace cherries

Mix together the ingredients for the filling. Grease a large roasting tin, about 14 x16 inches (35 x 40 cm) Make the scone dough (biscuit dough) in the food processor, i.e. whiz all the dry ingredients with cold cubed butter. Then add enough milk to make a soft dough. The original recipes called for 10 fluid oz of milk but I found that was far too much.

If you don't have a food processor, mix the dry ingredients and rub in the butter until the mixture looks like bread crumbs. Stir in milk gradually and mix quickly to form a soft dough.

Knead the dough lightly and roll out on a well floured board, into a rectangle 16 x12 inches (40 x 30 cm). Brush with a little milk and spread the prepared filling over as evenly as possible. Go right to the edges of the short sides. Press the filling into the dough lightly with the palm of your hand.

Working from a long side, roll up the dough like a swiss (jelly) roll. Cut with a sharp knife into 24 slices. This can be quite a sticky process. Place the slices flat onto the greased tin, in 4 rows of 6 buns. If you don't have a large tin, use 2 smaller ones. It is better if the slices almost touch so that the buns meet when cooked. This gives softer sides and makes it easier to ice them.

Bake at 425 F / 220 C for 20 - 25 minutes until well risen and cooked through. Leave until cold.

Mix the icing sugar and lemon juice to make a fairly soft icing. Drizzle over the buns from the end of a teaspoon, moving backwards and forwards to leave squiggly lines on each bun rather than a solid coating. Decorate with half a cherry if you like.

                Sweet Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  3               cups  Kind Arthur A-P Flour
  3               Tbsp  Lora Brody's Dough Relaxer
  1               Tbsp  Instant Yeast
  3               Tbsp  Butter
  3               Tbsp  Nonfat Non-Instant Dry Milk
  3               Tbsp  Sugar
  1               cups  Water
  1 1/4            Tsp  Salt
                        Filling:
     3/4          cups  King Arthur Bakers Cinnamon Filling -- *
  3               Tbsp  Water

I'm submitting 2 versions of a wonderful semi-sweet bread that I've been making the last week or so. Both recipes are of King Arthur Flours origin. The second one posted is my version using a sourdough starter. Have not tried the first entry but my version is really good. There is one small problem. Between the top crust of the bread and the first swirl of cinnamon filling I always get a big gap. I've tried this recipe three times and can't seem to determine how to keep this layer from separating. Perhaps some kind person on the list can give me some hints. The last time I made this loaf I brushed some beaten egg and water over the rolled out dough before adding the cinnamon filling, thinking that might help adhere the filling to the dough...No luck there.

In the meantime hope you find either one of these versions to your liking. Makes great toast and King Arthur Flours says it's also good for French toast.

*You might substitute super-fine sugar and ground cinnamon to taste.

Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them together--by hand, mixer or bread machine--till you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.

Roll the dough into an 8 x 24-inch rectangle. Mix together the filling ingredients, and spread it on the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll the dough up starting with a short edge, pinch the ends closed, and fit it, seam-side down, into a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pan. Cover the pan, and allow the loaf to rise for about 2 hours, or till it's crowned a scat 1 inch above the pan's rim.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for 40 to 45 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after 20 minutes so that it doesn't over-brown.  Remove it from the oven, and allow it to cool on a wire rack.

YIELD: 1 loaf

                Sweet Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  1               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast
  3               cups  All-Purpose Flour -- Unbleached
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt
     1/4           Tsp  Ground Ginger
     1/4           Tsp  Ground Nutmeg
  3               Tbsp  Lora Brody's Dough Relaxer -- Note 1
  2               Tbsp  Real Maple Syrup
     1/2          cups  Canned Pumpkin Puree -- Unseasoned
  2               Tbsp  Soft Butter
  1                     Extra Large Egg
     1/3          cups  Buttermilk -- Or
                        Sour Cream Or Plain Yogurt
     1/2          cups  Dried Cranberries
                        For Preparing Pan & Finishing The Rolls:
  1               Tbsp  Butter -- For Pans
  3               Tbsp  Butter
     1/2          cups  Light Corn Syrup -- Plus
  1               Tbsp  Light Corn Syrup
  1               cups  Coarsely Chopped Pecans -- (5 Oz)

Note 1: optional for a softer, richer dough that is easier to roll out

These beautiful, golden crusted  rolls will fill your kitchen with a heavenly aroma and make your friends and family happy to help you enjoy them. The dough Relaxer makes the dough easy to roll out and the finished rolls tender and flaky.

Place all the ingredients for the dough in the bread machine and program for Dough Cycle.  Check the dough after the first five minutes of the first knead cycle and add additional flour as necessary to achieve a smooth, soft ball of dough.  Add the cranberries at the very end of the final knead cycle.

At the end of the final rise cycle remove the dough to a lightly floured board.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Coat two 8" cake pans or one 12" deep dish pizza pan generously with the one tablespoon of butter.  Place the corn syrup and remaining three tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan set over moderate heat.  Whisk until the mixture is smooth and the butter has melted.  Pour this glaze into the pan(s) and tilt the pans allowing the entire bottom has been coated.  Sprinkle the pecans evenly over the glaze.

Roll the dough into 2 long ropes 16" in length.  Use a knife or dough scraper to cut each rope into eight 2" pieces.  Roll each piece into a ball and place it in the pan.  The balls do not have to touch, although it is fine if they do.

Cover the pan(s) with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with a light coating of non-stick vegetable spray and allow to rise until double in bulk.  Preheat the oven to 400F. and bake the rolls for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove the pan(s) and immediately invert onto a rimmed platter so that the glazed side is up.  Cool slightly before serving, or serve at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

  3               cups  self-rising flour
  3        Tablespoons  sugar
  12               oz.  beer

Preheat oven to 325F and grease two 8-1/2" x 4-1/2" loaf pans or one large 9"x5" pan. Mix ingredients together in a bowl until dough has the consistency of a mud pie. Divide dough between the two small pans or put it all into the one larger pan. Wet fingers with water and smooth the tops of the loaves. Bake for 40 to 60 minutes until bread is golden brown on top. Remove from oven and brush top with melted butter.

Note: This doesn't rise very high so doesn't make good sandwich bread, but tastes very good, especially considering the time and effort that goes into it!

NOTES : Father's Beer Bread always came out nicely but I haven't made it in years. I clipped the recipe out of a newspaper in 1980. The second one is for beer bread made in the microwave which was contributed to Sunset Magazine many years ago from a reader who got it off a TV cooking show. I haven't tried that one. A note on beer bread in general: The beer gives an unusual, slightly salty taste to bread, but beer varies, so you may need to experiment to find a brand that gives you the amount of saltiness you prefer.

  2                Pkg  Yeast
     1/2          cups  Warm Water

I do have a wonderful recipe for Finnish bread that I have made for 30 years & it does taste to me like the breads I've had in Finland.

Stir butter, sugar & salt into the hot water & let cool to lukewarm. Add yeast to the warm water & allow to begin to bubble. Then add to the first mixture in a large bowl. Mix in the rye flour & beat well. Add 2. unbleached flour & blend well. Sprinkling the last half-cup of flour onto a flat surface, knead for about 10 mins., adding more white flour as needed (here in Louisiana, it is humid so I always need to add a fair amount more.) Knead until smooth & shiny, roll into a ball & place in a greased bowl. Rub the melted butter or oil over the surface, cover bowl lightly & set in a warm place to rise. When an imprint of your finger stays indented, it is ready. Should take about an hour. Punch down, knead lightly, and divide into two round loaves. Place on a nonstick or greased baking sheet & flatten them to about one inch thick. Cover & let rise until almost double. Bake at 400F for 25-30 mins or until they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let cool on a rack.

Makes 2 round loaves

My children cut their teeth, literally, on this bread, though for them I used whole wheat in place of the rye.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          Teaspoons  yeast
  1                Cup  water -- (100 to 115 F.)
  1         Tablespoon  honey
  1 1/4      Teaspoons  salt
  2        Tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2        Tablespoons  semolina or corn meal
  1                Cup  unbleached all purpose flour
  2               Cups  unbleached bread flour
                        olive oil or cooking spray to grease

Place water, yeast, honey, olive oil, semolina (or corn meal) and bread flour in a large bowl or electric mixing bowl with a dough hook. Stir to blend and let rest a moment of two. Stir in salt, than remaining all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. Knead with dough hook or by hand to form a soft, but not-too sticky dough (8-12 minutes). Remove from bowl, lightly oil or spray top of dough and allow to rest, covered with a tea towel, for about 45 minutes.

Deflate dough very gently before using and allow dough to rest for another 15 minutes. Otherwise, you may refrigerate the dough in an oiled plastic bag for up to two days.

Flatten dough gently to make a generously 15 inch round. Sprinkle a large cookie sheet or a 16 inch aluminum pizza pan or rectangular baking sheet lightly with semolina or cornmeal. Dimple top of dough with fingertips. Drizzle with olive oil, dust with salt and coarse black pepper and shavings of fresh garlic or sauteed onions.

Preheat grill to "Medium". Place baking sheet or pan on grill and close cover. Allow bread to "set up" a couple minutes. Reduce heat to "Low". With a metal spatula, ease bread directly onto grill. Bake until done (another 5-8 minutes). If at any time, the bread seems to be cooking too quickly, reduce heat.

If you want this dough ready for supper and are out all day, use only 1/2 teaspoon yeast. Prepare dough and cover (or leave in bread machine) and allow for a long rise throughout the day.

This recipe is a good way to begin breads-on-the-grill baking.

"From my maternal Grandmother, who inherited the recipe from her German mother.  Every year at our annual family weekend reunion, this is a must, as well as our homemade noodles fixed with salt pork and tomatoes and German Kuchen."

Dump measured ingredients into large bowl or pan.  Mix well.  Put in individual cans with spring tops, or can use soup cans-vegetable cans with waxed paper or foil on top.  (Use rubber band to anchor waxed paper).

Put in steamer with water 1/2 way up the cans and steam for 2 hours. (If steamer is not available, a Dutch oven with a cover, or even a covered roasting pan could be used).  After steaming for 2 hours, put in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.  (If toothpick test is clean after steaming, this step can be omitted). Makes approximately 5-6 tins.  (I spray Pam into the cans before adding batter, and let cool slightly before removing from cans).

(Confession from Keri - this is NOT my own family's recipe.  I received the recipe with the family reunion description on it, but, alas, no name of the originator.)

                        *****

I grill pizza. It's really easy! Make your favorite pizza dough (I sometimes add a tablespoon or two of herbs de provence or some pesto), then chill it well after the final rise (I do this in a gallon size heavy duty Ziplock baggie). Prepare the toppings you want to use - keep them on the light-side as heavy toppings will make the pizza soggy. My favorites are sauteed sliced portobello mushrooms, green onion and stilton, or fresh native tomatoes, chopped with a little garlic, minced onions and basil, or shredded smoked gouda and minced cooked chicken. But any of your favorite topping should be fine - as long as they are cooked first. Heat your grill making sure the upper wire rack is very clean (I spray mine with non-stick vegetable spray to prevent sticking). While the grill is heating divide the dough into apple-sized portions and roll each portion out on a well-oiled worksurface. You want to roll the dough as thin as possible - you might want to try doing it between two sheets of plastic wrap. You are not supposed to have perfect circles - mine usually look like maps of some Baltic country. Thin, well oiled dough is the key to success. When the fire is hot lay one or two pieces of dough on the rack and cover the grill. After 2-3 minutes check the underside. If it looks dry, use a metal spatula to flip the dough over. Add you toppings and cover the grill. Cook for another 3-5 minutes or until the underside is dry and the toppings are melted. Repeat with the other pieces of dough. You can keep the cooked pizzas warm by moving them to the side of the grill where the fire isn't quite so hot.

                        *****

Why don't you do grilled garlic bread? Just take a nice unsliced loaf of your favorite, cut it crosswise into long, inch-thick pieces. Then melt some butter (not margarine...yukkh) and squeeze in some fresh garlic to taste. Don't use garlic powder. It tastes awful, IMHO. You can throw in some pepper, or paprika if you like the color, or sprinkle some parmesan or romano on top (yumm!). Grill the bread lightly on both sides to crisp it up, brush the garlic butter on top, then let it grill a bit longer to heat it thru. Don't let it dry out too much. Fresh grilled garlic bread and a good green salad with balsamic vinaigrette...it doesn't get much better than that! Bon bar-b-q.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  5          teaspoons  dry yeast
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/3           cup  oil
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  malted milk powder -- or syrup
  6               cups  bread flour
                        milk -- for brushing
                        sesame seeds

[Russ' notes: These make wonderful hamburger buns. We use them with Carolina Pork BBQ. Place water, yeast and pinch of sugar in bread machine pan and let stand for a couple of minutes. Add in remaining ingredients. Place machine on dough mode. When cycle is over, remove dough from machine. Gently deflate. Divide dough in 8-10 portions, cover with a clean tea towel and let rest five minutes. Shape each portion into a ball and place, evenly spaced apart, on a parchment paper (I use waxed) lined baking sheet. Place a towel over them. Allow to rise until quite puffy, around 20-30 minutes. Flatten each roll gently with palm of hand. Brush, if desired with milk (it improves the brown color) and sprinkle on sesame seeds. Preheat oven to 375 F. Bake, until nicely browned, around 15-20 minutes. Freeze leftovers. 8-10 Rolls or Buns]

"This is a deceptively simple, but enriched white bread, grandma-style dough. Small additions such as malt (if you don't have it, leave it out but check sources before abandoning it prematurely), a touch more sugar, and oil make the sort of dough that commercial bakeries fashion their hamburger rolls with - only these taste a million times better. In fact, the malt, sugar, and oil, in fact, are responsible for the wholesome flavor but more importantly, contribute to nice, even browning on these rolls - so characteristic of commercial hamburger rolls. Easily made in the bread machine on Dough Cycle, then plucked out and shaped into rolls, this recipe makes incredible, wonderfully spongy and flavor-packed, SUBSTANTIAL hamburger rolls take the average barbecued hamburger supper up a notch. You need a bread machine capacity of at least 1 1/2 pounds to make this recipe."

Or, add poppy seeds, onion soup mix to top.

  1 1/2            Tsp  Butter Or Margarine
  1 1/2            Tsp  Rapid Rise Yeast

Here is a good loaf for the bread machine (or not) that my toddlers love. It is a good way to get little people to accept the look of grains and such in their bread.  The recipe, adapted from my bread machine cookbook, uses King Arthur's tasty 10-Grain Baking Blend, though I imagine any similar 10-Grain cereal blend found in a local health food store would work (The KA Blend does not look like breakfast cereal -- flakes are all tiny, about the size of an oatmeal flake broken in half or smaller).

Mix in bread machine or by hand.  Bake in machine or oven, as desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1Lb Loaf:
  8                 Oz  Stone-Ground Whole Meal Flour -- (225Gr)
  3                 Oz  Coarse Oatmeal -- (75Gr)

     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
  1                     Egg -- (Size 2)
     1/2          Pint  Buttermilk -- (275Ml)

You'll need a 1 lb loaf tin, well greased and lightly dusted with flour.

Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C

All you do is place the flour, oatmeal, sugar, salt and bicarbonate of soda in a bowl and mix them well together.  Then whisk the egg into the buttermilk and add that to the dry ingredients, mixing everything together thoroughly.

The mixture will remain quite soft, so just place it in the tin and bake it on the middle shelf of the oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the loaf sods hollow when you tap it on the underneath.

Leave it on a wire rack to cool, and serve very fresh in crusty slices, spread with Irish butter.

This bread is also lovely fresh from the oven on a cold winter weekend and served for tea with butter and homemade jam.

  6               cups  unbleached wheat flour
  1                cup  stone-ground whole wheat flour
  3               cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar

  1              large  red bell pepper -- diced
  1              large  green bell pepper -- diced
     1/2         pound  Monterey jack cheese
                        diced into 1/2 inch cubes
     1/2         pound  Cheddar cheese
                        diced into 1/2 inch cubes

Yields 10-pound batch.

  From Baker Rick Heenan, The Village Baker, Flagstaff, Arizona

Combine and mix flours, water, and sugar.  If mixing by hand, add the
flours slowly and mix for 10 minutes.  If using an electric mixer, mix
ingredients for 5 minutes.

Knead in yeast, then salt.  Knead in jalapenos, bell peppers, and cheese.

Let the dough rise in a deep, greased, covered container for 1 to 2 hours,
until volume is doubled.  Deflate dough by punching it down.

Wait 10 to 20 minutes and cut to desired weight (typically 1 to 2
pounds).  Roll into rounds, cover with loose plastic wrap, and allow a
second rise (generally half the time of the first rise).

Preheat oven to 425F.

Form into loaves by patting each round into a rough rectangle and tightly
rolling it toward you to produce a smooth top.  Pinch seams together to
close.  Place into well-greased bread pans, seam side down.  The dough
should fill one-half to two-thirds of each pan.  Cover loaves with loose
plastic wrap and let them rise to just over the pan lips.

Bake about 1 hour until golden brown.  Check loaves by tapping bottoms of
bread pans - a hollow sound indicates the breads are ready.

Smoke the jalapenos in a smoker or on a grill.  Dice and set aside.

In a large bowl, mix bread flour, water, yeast, and honey.  If mixing by
hand, use a wooden spoon until all is combined, about 10 minutes.  If using
an electric mixer, use a dough hook and mix until all is well combined,
about 5 to 6 minutes

Add salt.  Mix 6 minutes.

Add peppers, tomatoes, and cheese.  Knead 5 to 10 minutes.  Let dough rest
1 1/2 hours.  Form into 2 loaves and place on well-greased oven-proof tray
or cookie sheet.  Cover and allow to rest until they have doubled in size,
about 1 more hour.

Preheat oven to 425F

Bake for 35 minutes, misting occasionally with water.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: These loaves can be assembled without smoking the jalapenos,
but they will lack an excellent flavoring.

                        Egg White Beaten W/ 1 Tbsp water

Note 1: scant Tbsp, OR or regular instant yeast

MIXER METHOD: Kitchen Aid

Using paddle attachment, mix all dough ingredients, except salt and water in mixing bowl. With mixer running on #1 slowly pour in enough water to make a nice slack dough. Stop machine, cover and allow dough to rest 20 minutes. Switching to dough hook, add the salt and knead the dough until a soft dough forms. I knead for 3 minutes, shut off machine for 2 minutes, knead again 2-3 minutes, rest dough another minute or two, then knead by hand a few minutes.  (you want a very supple dough). Add a tad more water or flour during the kneading process, if necessary. Cover, to rise 1 1/2  hours.

Punch down, roll out in a 8" x 24" rectangle. [brush on a mixture of beaten whole egg and a little water over the rolled out dough -- optional]. Mix filling and spread on the dough, leaving a 1" border on all sides.  Roll dough up starting with the short edge.  Pinch ends closed, fit it, seam- side down into a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan. Cover, to rise about 2 hours, or till it's crowned a scant 1" above the rim.

Paint on the egg glaze just before placing loaf in oven.

Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 40-45 minutes, tenting lightly after 20 minutes. Remove from pan, smear with soft butter, if desired, and allow to cool on wire rack. [Required almost a hour to bake to 190F.

YIELD: 1 loaf (1 lb 10 oz)

SOURCE: Created by Joni Repasch 09/05/00 and based on a King Arthur Flour
Recipe from their Baker's Cinnamon Filling bag: Item # 3037.

Notes are based upon the first attempt at this recipe 09/05/00 Date Tested: 09/05/00; 09/07; 09/11

Results:  Delicious, but large spaces between the swirls. Bread falls apart because of this.

Ingredients:  Measured out 1/2 cup for the water, added 1/2 cup sourdough starter to replace the full cup of water.Used all of the flour, but only 3 3/4 oz  water. Still could have been a tad slacker.

To the filling mixture added freshly ground mace and cardamon, plus 1/2 tsp orange oil.

Rolled out the dough too wide; had to scrunch it together to make it fit the pan.

Glazed loaf with beaten Egg Beaters and a little water. Smeared on soft margarine after baking.

Method:  Kitchen Aid - My regular method.

   1st rise: 1 1/2 hours
   2nd rise: 1 hour
   Baking: 60 minutes

Comments: Nice dough to work with. If you spray your work surface with vegetable oil before rolling out the dough, it will be easier to roll.  I used a tiny plastic spatula to smear on the filling.

Other Notes: Baker's Cinnamon Filling # 3037. Ingredients: Sugar, spray dried shortening, cinnamon, Instant Clearjel, natural butter flavor, available from King Arthur Flour Co.

Note 2: (2 1/4 ozs) OR molasses,  light/dark corn syrup or honey
Note 3: OR 1/2 to 3/4 cups ( ozs) lukewarm water (105 F-110 F)

Again, I have altered a King Arthur Flour Recipe to produce this really wholesome loaf. I've only made this once and although my husband thought it was delicious, it tended not to hold together well cut. Perhaps I used a little to much liquid. So, although you want it slack, make sure it's not too sticky to handle. Should you not have KA's 10-Grain-Cereal on hand, not to worry, you can certainly use some substitute such as any multi-grain cereal.  You should also know that although some of the ingredients are my own, the method is directly lifted from a King Arthur Flour recipe.....Credit should be mainly theirs.

Combine all the ingredients EXCEPT the water and salt into mixer bowl.

Using the paddle attachment stir the ingredients, then add about 1/2 cup of the water, pouring it in slowing as the mixer runs. Stir again; the dough will begin to clump up and form a ball. At this point, give a few more stirs and cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes or so. This gives the flour a chance to absorb the liquid, and will help prevent you from adding too much flour as you knead the dough later.

Kneading the Dough: Switch to the dough hook and add in the salt, mix until well distributed. Knead the dough on speed #2 for 3 minutes, adding a little more water if dough is too dry. Stop machine and allow dough to rest 2 minutes; start machine and knead another 2-3 minutes. The dough should become springy, supple, smooth, soft...when you poke it, it should feel like a baby's bottom.

First Rise: Use your bowl scraper to scrape any dried bits of dough out of your mixing bowl, grease the bowl with pan spray, and place the kneaded dough in the bowl. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (I like to place plastic over the bowl, then a damp towel.) Ideally, the rising temperature will be between 75F and 85F. (I like to place the covered bowl in a unheated oven with the oven light on.)

Shaping: After the dough has risen, transfer to a lightly greased work surface, gently deflate it, and shape it into an oval about 8 inches long. Do not punch or treat it roughly; this will just make the gluten "seize up" and become hard to work with.

Transfer the shaped loaf to a lightly grease 8 1/2 x 4 1/2- inch loaf pan.

Second Rise: Cover the pan. We use an acrylic dough-rising cover, as it's easy and reusable; but feel free to use a dampened towel, or lightly greased plastic wrap. Just be sure either of those two is place LOOSELY over the pan; you don't want your loaf hindered in any way as it rises. Set the pan in a 75- 85F rising area, and let the loaf rise till its highest point (the center) has crowned about 1 inch over the rim of the pan; this should take 30 to 45 minutes, or perhaps slightly longer.

Baking: Place the bread in a COLD oven, and turn the heat to 350F. Bake the bread for 35 minutes. Insert instant-read thermometer into the side of the bread. It should read 190F. If not, give it a few more minutes and measure the temperature again.

When done, remove it from the oven, and transfer it immediately to a cooling rack. Run a stick of butter or margarine over the top crust, if desired; this will make the crust soft. Allow the bread to cool before cutting.

When cool, store it in a plastic bag, at room temperature, or freeze it.

Put the oatmeal, 1 cup of wheat germ, 6 cups of white flour, 1 tablespoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast in a large bowl.  About 3 cups of tepid water will make up the dough.  Knead it, roll it in flour, and put it right back in the bowl you mixed it up in.  Cover the bowl and go to sleep.

2. The next morning, make the coffee and knock down the bread.  Divide it in half and put each half into a buttered bread tin (you can butter them the night before and stick them in the fridge to save time).  Cover the tins with a tea towel and go to work.

3. When you come home, heat the oven to 400F., paint the top of the loaves with milk (this is a frill and need not be done, but it makes a nice-looking crust), and bake for about 40 minutes, turning once.  It is hard to describe the nutty, buttery taste of this bread, and it is worth the 15 minutes of work it took you to make it.

My notes:  I made this without grinding up the oats first and it did fine. I was wondering about the lack of sugar and fat in this recipe, but the bread worked okay without them.  The loaves have a nice crackly top crust (I brushed it with half and half) with lots of fish eyes and a beautiful dark brown exterior.  The texture is good, lots of little even holes inside.  The bread tastes pretty hearty, but not too dry, and I think I'll try it with a smear of country mustard and some roast beef.

For the first rise, I let it go 12 hours, and I let it go 3 hours for the second rise, baking it when the loaves rose to the top edges of the bread pans.  The first time I tried to make this bread, I must have let it rise for too long on the second rise (more like 10 hours), because it rose over the edges of the bread pans, collapsed, and blopped onto my oven floor in big globs.  (I let my bread rise in a cold oven.)  There wasn't much ovenspring with this bread, but then with only 1/2 teaspoon yeast and the wheat germ and oats, I guess you couldn't expect much.

I am still trying to figure out how to keep the dough from drying out during the long rises.  I've oiled the dough and covered it with a damp dish towel, but it still got a skin.  Maybe I'll branch out to oiled plastic wrap, or a shower cap over the bowl.  Any suggestions?

                        One Recipe Middle Eastern Flatbread dough
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- up to 3
     1/2         pound  lean ground beef
     1/4           cup  parsley -- minced
  2          teaspoons  red pepper sauce
                        OR hot sauce
     1/2           cup  onion -- grated
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  canned tomatoes -- minced finely
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        salt and pepper to taste
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
                        OR pomegranate molasses -- (Cortas is good)

In a skillet, brown the meat in the oil. Stir in parsley and onion and allow onions to soften. Add remaining ingredients. Adjust seasonings. Pre-heat grill to "Medium".

Prepare dough in very thin 8 inch rounds. Smear with a touch of olive oil. Cover rounds and let rest five minutes. Spread a portion of filling on top of each.

To bake, start on a cookie sheet then transfer directly to grill. Baking could take as little as 3 to 5 minutes depending on thickness. Keep an eye on them.

This variation makes for a spicy, mildly meaty spread that turns a small flatbread into something special. Middle Eastern spice stores have all the spices you need. Substitutions are noted. These can be made in advance and reheated. The topping should be applied modestly.

  3               cups  Sour -- 4 1/2 cups
     1/2          tbsp  Sugar -- 1/2 tbsp
  2                pkg  yeast -- 3 pkg
     1/2           cup  rye flour -- 3/4 cup
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour -- 3/4 cup

  1                cup  warm water -- 1 1/2 cup
  1                cup  milk -- 1 1/2 cup
                        chopped onions


(Higher number next to ingredient is for increased recipe size that I use)

Allow to stand for two hours to soften the berries. Proof the yeast as
follows:

1/2 (3/4) cup warm water, 3/4 cup
1 TBSP sugar, 1 1/2 TBSP
2 (3) packages (TBSP) active dry yeast. 3 pkg yeast
While the yeast is proofing, combine in a bowl:
1/3 (1/2)cup rye flour, 1/2 cup
1/3 (1/2) cup whole-meal, whole-wheat flour, 1/2 cup
3 (4 1/2)cups white flour, 4 1/2 cups
the drained wheat berries, and
1 (1 1/2) TBSP salt. 1 1/2 TBSP

Add:

the proofed yeast mixture from above, 1 (1 1/2) cup of warm milk, and 1 (1 1/2) cup of warm water.

(Note that you may use the water that was used to soak the wheat berries.)

Knead well for about 10 minutes, adding additional: white flour about 1/2 cup at a time. You may need to add 3 more (4 1/2) cups, give or take a bit.

Form into a ball, place in greased bowl covered. Rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut in two, form loaves, and allow to rise again.

You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl. I never have, but that is in her original recipe. As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 F. oven.

This bread should have a good crunchy crust.

Can make without wheat berries.

NOTES : Mrs Elizabeth Ovenstadt Sourdough Bread - but she does not know about it.  I took her regular recipe and adapted it for sourdough.

This is basically the wheat berry bread of Mrs. Elizabeth Ovenstadt, but I have set it up to use my sour instead of just water. Good taste.

     1/2           Tsp  Baking Soda
  1 3/4            Tsp  Salt

In a large mixing bowl fitted with a dough hook (or use bread machine), whisk together the yeast, water, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Whisk in remaining sugar, egg and oil. Stir in cream and milk and most of the flour (reserve one cup), baking powder and salt. Stir to make a soft dough. Attach dough hook (or knead by hand) and make a soft, supple dough, adding more flour as required (10 to 15 minutes). Place in a lightly oiled plastic bag and let rest until doubled, or refrigerate overnight (you may keep dough refrigerated for up to four days). Allow to come to room temperature before using (bread will rise up as it warms). Break dough off in pieces around the size of a grapefruit. Let rest a minute or so, then roll into rounds about the size of your hand. Stretch gently lengthwise and sideways to make a teardrop shaped slab. Place dough slabs on a cookie sheet and cover with a tea towel. Let rest 10-15 minutes. Preheat gas grill to hottest temperature (500 F.). Place nan slabs on grill and put cover down. Bake until dough puffs up, (3 to 5 minutes). Using tongs, turn over bread to cook other side, for another 3 to 5 minutes. Dough may look scorched in areas but this is OK. Serve immediately, or cover in foil and keep warm on the warming section of the grill. Note: Most recipes for nan call for yogurt and milk, but this version is similar to ones I have enjoyed in Indian restaurants. This recipe is adapted from the one generously provided by Montreal's landmark Bombay Palace Restaurant. Rustic, chewy, addictive - this is perfect for a mountain of tandoori chicken or just about any main dish.

  3 1/2           cups  Water -- Approx

Note 1: or high-gluten bread flour (I use half and half)

Mix all the dry ingredients, then add the water water.  Mix well.  Knead for about 8 minutes, or until a soft tacky dough is formed.  The dough should be tacky, but not sticky.

Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and allow to rise approximately 1-1/2 hours.  Punch down and allow to rise again for another hour. Divide the dough in two, knead briefly, and form into tight balls. Sprinkle a little cornmeal or polenta on a large oiled baking sheet and place the balls on the   sheet at least two inches apart.  Cover and allow to rise for one hour.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees with a baking stone inside.  Slash the loaf tops with a lame, razor blade, or serrated knife.  Spray the loaves with a mister.  Place the baking sheet directly on the baking stone, spray the oven with the mister, and quickly close the door.  Spray 3 more times every 2 minutes.  Bake for 30 minutes and then check the temperature of the loaves with an instant thermometer.

You are looking for a deep golden color and an internal temperature of l90F.  Cool on racks at least 30 minutes before slicing.  This bread freezes very well.

This recipe was adapted from a recipe of the Brother Juniper Bakery in Forestville, California, and appears in Lee Bailey's California Wine Country Cooking.  I am submitting it as a result of foolishly shooting off my mouth about it in a reply to Susie in Atlanta about an alternative to high-priced bread-rising baskets.  As a result, I received 642 bazillion requests for the recipe.  In the next few days, I will post the recipes for a rustic country bread, a damned good sourdough bread, and a knock-your-knickers-off Jewish rye bread. Please don't get the impression that I am complaining about being asked for these recipes.  I love it because, in addition to being a good baker, I am also a show-off baker.

I tried this bread today and just had to send the recipe to you bread bakers.  This bread is simple, in that, it takes very few ingredients, but plan on 24-48 hours before you have a loaf of this delicious goodie.

This crusty, slightly domed and delicious peasant bread is made with a very slack (wet) dough. The dough is almost impossible to work with, [that's an understatement jtr] but produces a pleasingly open texture. A long fermentation enhances the bread's flavor. (King Arthur Flour Co).

Biga:
In a small mixing bowl, combine the water, flour and yeast to form a soft dough. Don't knead it; just make sure all of the ingredients are well-incorporated. Set this mixture aside in a warm place, covered, for 12 to 16 hours.

Dough:
Knead all of the dough ingredients together, using a mixer or bread machine (this is well nigh impossible to knead by hand), until the dough is cohesive and elastic (though not necessarily smooth), about 10 minutes. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours, gently stirring it down each hour. (The longer you let the dough rise at this point, the better the flavor of the finished loaf will be).

Lightly grease a half-sheet pan or other flat pan*. (See my notes)  Scoop the very wet dough, in two separate pieces, onto the pan lengthwise, shaping each piece into a rough oval as best you can. [Good luck] Cover the dough with heavily greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for about 90 minutes. It'll spread quite a bit; don't worry, it's supposed to.

Spray the loaves heavily with warm water, and bake them in a preheated 450F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they're a deep, golden brown. Turn the oven off, prop the door open, transfer the loaves from the pan to the oven rack, and allow them to cool in the turned-off oven.

Yield: 2 loaves.
Source: King Arthur Flour Co.

MY NOTES:

Date Tested: 08/15/00
Results: Out of this world! A winner!
Weather: Clear, rather hot, high in upper 80's. A/C off.
Ambient kitchen temp 78-86
Ingredients: Exactly as written
Method: KitchenAid:

     Allowed dough to rest after mixing for 20 minutes.
     Kneaded 3 minutes, rested 2 minutes, kneaded 3 minutes, rested 2
minutes, kneaded 3 more minutes.  Covered bowl and allowed to rise 1 hour,
stirred down gently every hour for 3 hours.
Used 2 1-half sheet pans covered with greased parchment paper. (See my
changes later on)
   Proof:   About 1 hour. (Room very warm, about 86)
   Baking: 25 minutes exactly.

Comments: This dough was so slack it was impossible to handle. Perhaps I
could have used a little more flour than recipe called for but wanted to
prepare it just as written.

Placing the divided dough onto 1 half sheet pan produced a risen dough
became one. One loaf almost fell off the pan during the proofing period.
Ended I cutting parchment paper down the middle between the two loaves and
moving it and one loaf to pizza peel. This loaf I baked on pizza stone. The
remaining loaf, which was still on the half sheet, I baked in the lower
part of the oven. Because it wasn't as exposed to the top element it's
crust wasn't as brown as I would have liked.

  I served this with a dipping oil: Olive oil, crushed basil and balsamic
vinegar.

Mix flour and salt in bowl and make well in center. Mix yeast and 2/3 cup water. Add this to well. Mix in remaining water and gradually incorporate remaining water and gradually add in remaining flour until a firm dough forms. Knead for at least ten minutes. Cover and let rest until doubled - 5-6 hours. Punch down dough and knead for 5 minutes. Cover and let rise for at least another 2 hours. Punch down again and knead for a few more minutes. Roll out dough to form a rough rectangle 1" thick. Fold to make a roll about 13 x 5. Fold under ends and place seam side up on greased paper for 15 minutes. Then place on lightly greased baking pan. Tuck in sides and ends again. Make 6 diagonal slices across loaf, coat with salt solution, sprinkle poppy seeds on loaf and let rest in warm place for 10 minutes. The salt solution will be readily absorbed so make sure the entire top is covered with solution.Place in preheated 450 oven that has been misted. Bake for 20 minutes and reduce temperature to 400. Bake for another 25 minutes. Cool on rack.

One way to proof bread is the microwave. To do it, heat a measuring cup of water in the microwave to boiling point, then shut off the microwave and place the dough inside. The preheated water keeps the dough at a warm temp while it proofs in a moist and draft-free environment. This method works well regardless of the ambient humidity.

This was submitted to the Quick Tips column in Cook's Illustrated, Nov/Dec 1996.

re: proofing bread in the microwave:another great way is to use the dishwasher! Run the empty (soapless) dishwasher on the rinse cycle. Open the door briefly to release the really hot steam. Place the plastic covered dough in the top or bottom - wherever it fits best. You should do this for the final rise only since it's really too fast to develop a first rise enough to have good flavor and texture.
I was teaching in California where a student shared the fact that she sometimes rises bread on the dash board of her closed car parked in the sun.
 I tried it and it worked fine- except it's important to keep a careful eye on it - remember what those video tapes look like after they've spent too much time on the car's dashboard.
My son works on a landscaping crew where some of the men put their lunches (not sandwiches...) on the truck's manifold to heat up - which reminds me of the cookbook Manifold Destiny which features a poached salmon that's done in the dishwasher. OK enough rambling - back to work... [Blanche007@aol.com]

My favorite method is to turn on the light in the oven, and place a teakettle full of just-boiled water in with the dough. This warms the oven to just the right temp, and perhaps adds a bit of humidity, too! Of course, I always cover to dough, so the humidity might not make that much difference. [Paul and Ruth Provance <prmtprovance@erols.com>]

---

OK One more way to raise bread. Find, collect or buy one of the foam mailing boxes (the kind approved for shipment with dry ice) big enough for one or two loaf pans. Put about 2-3 qts. of hot water in bottom before placing the rising bread and pans in. Cover and let rise. I find the thick-walled boxes hold the heat and are tighter than most picnic coolers. Smaller footprint and not so tall. Also good for bringing refrigerated dough in plastic bag back up to temp. When the slow-cool-rise of sourdough is just proceeding too slowly I find I can finish most rises in about 45 min this way. [Bill Bowers <wbowers@Ag.Arizona.Edu>]

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all purpose flour -- sifted
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4                     eggs
                        -- (I use 2 eggs & 2 egg substitutes)
  1                cup  milk
  4        tablespoons  butter -- cut into bits
                        powdered sugar for garnish

Preheat the oven to 435 degrees. Heat 2 9-inch cast iron skillets or heavy cake pans (I use a big cast iron skillet) (you need sturdy pans that can hold and conduct heat)

Mix the flour, sugar and salt. Add the milk and eggs, blending only until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.

Take the pans from the oven. in each pan, put 2 tablespoons of butter. Swirl to coat with butter as it melts.

Divide the pancake batter equally between the pans, pouring it in quickly. Immediately return the pans to the oven. bake until golden brown and puffy, about 25 minutes. (Don't worry if the pancakes start to sink as soon as they are removed from the oven - that's normal)

Sprinkle with the powdered sugar and serve immediately, in wedges. Serves 4-6.

I like this recipe for times when we have an overnight guest and I'm making breakfast, which I don't do that often - this allows me time to make eggs, bacon or any other breakfasty kind of food while the pancake bakes...

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  all-purpose flour -- (6 to 6 1/2)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (4 1/2 teaspoons)
     1/4           cup  lightly salted butter or margarine -- at room temperature
  2               cups  hot water
                        -- (about 130 degrees F)
  1              large  egg

1) In the large bowl of an electric mixer, mix 2 cups of flour, sugar, salt  and yeast. Add butter.
2) Pour in the hot water and beat 2 minutes at medium speed, scraping bowls  occasionally with a rubber spatula. Add the egg and 1 1/2 cups more flour, or  enough to make a thick batter. When smooth, beat 2 minutes longer at high speed.
3) With a spoon, gradually stir in just enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.
4) turn out the dough onto a well floured surface (use some of the remaining  flour)  and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic, adding only as  much flour as needed to prevent dough from sticking.
5) shape dough into a ball, cover with bowl turned upside down, and let stand  for 20 minutes.
6) uncover dough, punch down, then cut and shape as desired. Cover shaped rolls loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.
7) heat oven to 400 degrees F. Remove rolls from refrigerator and let stand 10 minutes at room temperature.
8) Bake at 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
9) Cool rolls on wire racks.

the book gives various illustrations to make Parker house rolls, bowknots, crescents and such but not soup bowls. I take small aluminum pie pans & spray well with Pam (no, not an employee, I just think it works), I shape a small handful of dough into a ball and place it in the pie pan to rise. Sometimes I allow it to rise overnight in the fridge, sometimes I let them rise outside of the fridge for about an hour before I bake them. I bake them in a 400 degree oven for about 17-20 minutes, or until they are browned on the top. Let them cool in the pie pan. Remove the bread bowl from the pan and place on a dish. Using a small sharp knife, cut a circle in top of the bead, pointing the knife towards the center so the chunk of bread you take out resembles a diamond setting - pointy at the bottom, round at the top. Fill the bowl with chili or soup or stew, serving the chunk of bread on the side.

there's a variation I have to admit I have never used but sounds intriguing. First you roll the dough out until it's about an inch thick. You cut a circle to fit the _outside_ of the pan. Spray/grease the _outside_ pie pan carefully and drape the dough over it. Bake at 400 degrees for about 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.

I have also placed these items in my bread machine in the order the Zo calls for them & produced a great dough to use later.

  1                Tsp  Instant Yeast -- (To 2 Tsp)
  2               cups  Rye Sourdough Starter
  1 1/2           cups  Med Rye Flour -- Or
                        Pumpernickel Bread
  2          teaspoons  Salt

  1               Tbsp  KA Rye Bread Improver -- Optional
  2               Tbsp  KA Rye Sour -- Optional
  4               Tbsp  Unsalted Butter -- Melted
  3               cups  KA Unbleached A-P Flour -- Note 1

Note 1: OR 1 1/2 cups First Clear Flour and 1 1/2 - 2 cups KA Bread Flour

I tweaked this recipe to allow for a sourdough starter and some First Clear Flour. Excellent and easy.

"The following recipe marks King Arthur's very first venture onto the Internet -- we obtained it from a Russian student at Moscow State University, via the 'net, back in late 1995." [KA Flours]

Manual/Mixer Method: Pour the warm water into a mixing bowl and add a teaspoon of the malt extract or honey. Stir in the yeast, rye sourdough starter and rye flour. Let this sponge work for at least 20 minutes, until it's expanded and bubbly.

Add the salt, caraway seeds, butter, remainder of the barley malt extract, rye bread improver, 2 rye sour, 1 1/2 cups First Clear Flour and enough of the bread flour to create a dough that begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. At this point, cover the dough with a towel or plastic wrap, and let it stand for about 5 minutes.

Mixer Kneading:
Remove paddle attachment and insert the dough hook. Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes. Turn machine off and allow dough to rest 2-3 minutes. Knead again by machine or hand another 5 minutes. Add only enough more bread flour to keep dough from sticking unbearably.

Manual Kneading:
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or lightly oiled work surface, and knead until it's smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, adding only enough flour (or oil on your hands and the work surface) to keep the dough from sticking unbearably. (Rye doughs will always be a bit sticky, so resist the urge to keep adding flour to eliminate this inherent stickiness; adding too much flour will make a heavy, dense, dry loaf.)

Halfway through, give the dough a rest while you clean out and butter your mixing bowl.

Shape the dough into a ball, place it in the buttered bowl, turning to coat, and cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until it's just about doubled in bulk. Punch the dough down, and divide it in half. Shape each half into an oval, place them on a lightly greased [or corn-meal] parchment-lined baking sheet, [pizza peel] cover, and let rise for about 30 minutes.

[After doubled, glaze with egg white/milk or cornstarch glaze from _Secrets of a Jewish Baker_*. Make slashes. Bake at 425F for 15 min ..Lower heat to 400F and bake another 15 - 30 min depending on size of loaves.] Crust should be a dark brown, and interior temperature should measure 190 to 200F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a wire rack.

*

"While bringing 1 cup water to a boil, dissolve 2 Tbsp cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water; whisk into boiling water until mixture thickens. Brush on loaf before slashing & placing in the oven, and again as soon as you take the bread out of the oven." from _Secrets of a Jewish Baker_.

  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/3           cup  oil
     1/3           cup  instant nonfat dry milk
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  4               cups  flour -- up to 5 cups

Yield:  20 -24 sandwich buns.

A wonderful homemade replacement for "hamburger buns," these are especially delightful with vegetarian burgers!

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water.

2. To dissolve yeast add sugar, salt, oil, dry milk, and whole wheat flour. Beat vigorously by hand.

3. Stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough.

4. Turn out onto lightly floured board. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.

5. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top.

6. Cover. Let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.

7. Punch dough down. Let rise again until less than double, about 20 minutes.

8. Divide dough in half. Cut each half into 10-20 pieces. Form each piece into a smooth round ball. Place on greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Let rest for 5 minutes. Press each ball with palm of hand to flatten.

9. Cover and let rise in warm place, free from draft, until double in bulk, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

10. Bake at 375 for 15-20 minutes or until done. Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire racks.

Poster's notes: I added 1 cup finely grated onion and 1 teaspoon each basil, thyme, and oregano with the whole wheat flour. Also, I cut the oil to 1 tablespoon and added more warm water and instant dry milk to compensate for the difference in liquid.

  1                Tsp  Salt
  4               cups  Semolina Flour -- (To 5 C)

What a delight to prepare this light somewhat yellow loaf. Just the right size for sandwiches if placed in a 5-inch X 9-inch or 10-inch pan. I did have one problem with this bread. I think there may have been a misprint in the amount of water or flour. I followed directions as written and after adding the required 3 cups of semolina flour I had a batter, not a kneadable dough. I had to keep adding a little more flour until I was able to get the consistency I wanted, and even then dough was extremely slack. You might try this recipe using only 1 cup of water and 3 cups of flour and see what you get. That is what I will do next time. I used my KitchenAid Mixer for all of the mixing and most of the kneading.

"When people think of semolina flour, they usually think of pasta. But semolina, a high-gluten flour made from the hard, coarse endosperm of durum wheat, also makes a lovely loaf of bread. Light golden in color, moist, and of a fine, delicate texture ideal for slicing, this bread recipe is based on one found in Judith and Evan Jones' "The Book of Bread," available in our Baker's Catalogue (as is the semolina flour.)" KAF

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the warm water in a large bowl. Mix the butter and the dry milk into the remaining cup of water, and add to the yeast along with the salt. Stir in the semolina.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface floured with a little more semolina and knead it for 8 to 10 minutes, until smooth. Grease a bowl, set the dough in the bowl, turning to coat all sides, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours or more.

Punch the dough down, turn it out of the bowl, and shape it into a loaf. Place it into a greased 5-inch x 10-inch bread pan. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 50 minutes.

Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 40 minutes, or until bread is a light golden brown and tests done. Turn the loaf out and let it cool on a rack. Let cool thoroughly before slicing.

YIELD: Makes 1 large loaf

Kitchen Temp: A/C on 75
Ingredients: As written: Note: 3 cups of flour (15 3/4 ozs) way too little
or amount of water (1 1/2 cups) much too much.
Used between 4-5 cups flour.
Used all water as written.

Comment: After adding 3 cups of flour to liquid ingredients, mixture more like a batter than a kneadable dough. Had to add between 1 and 2 cups additional flour to make dough into a kneadable state. Next time use only 1 cup of water total to begin with and only add more if needed. Very attractive bread and oh so moist

An easy recipe with excellent results.

In a large bowl combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast.

In a saucepan, over medium-high heat, heat water and butter to 120 to
130F.  Add warm liquid to yeast mixture; beat until well combined.  Stir in
flax seed and enough flour to make a soft dough.  Turn out onto a lightly
floured surface.  Knead, adding more flour as necessary until dough is
smooth and no longer sticky, about 4 minutes.

Place dough into a well greased bowl, and cover loosely with well greased
plastic wrap.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes to
1 hour.

                       Sourdough English Muffins #2

Recipe By     :Copyright 2000, King Arthur Flour Co.

                Sourdough Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2               cups  warm water -- 105 to 110F
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  sourdough starter
  7               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (7 to 8)
     1/2           cup  non-fat dry milk
     1/4           cup  butter -- at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sour salt (citric acid) -- optional
                        approximately 2 tablespoons cornmeal or
                        semolina.

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Stir in and dissolve the yeast, and then mix in the sourdough starter and 1 cup of flour. Let this sit for a few minutes, until the mixture begins to bubble.

Add the dry milk, butter, salt, sour salt (if you're using it; it's a nice flavor-booster) and a second cup of flour, and beat well. Add 5 to 6 cups of flour, one cup at a time, to form a dough that holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it until it's smooth and springy, but slightly on the slack side, about 8 minutes. Add flour only as necessary to prevent sticking. Clean out and grease your bowl and place the dough in the greased bowl, turning it so that a thin film of oil coats all sides. If you want muffins with just a hint of sourness, cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel, let it stand until it has doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, and proceed from * below. If you want muffins with a more pronounced sour flavor, be sure to add the sour salt to the dough for extra tang; then cover the finished dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it sit overnight, or up to 24 hours, in a cool place.

* When the dough has risen your chosen length of time, punch it down, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, cover it and let it sit for a few minutes (to relax the gluten). Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece out separately to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into 3-inch rounds; re-roll and cut any remaining scraps. Place the rounds, evenly spaced, onto cornmeal- or semolina-sprinkled baking sheets (12 or 13 rounds per sheet), sprinkle them with additional cornmeal or semolina, cover with plastic wrap, and let them rise until light and puffy, about 1 hour.

Carefully transfer the rounds (as many as a time that will fit without crowding) right-side up to a large electric griddle preheated to 350F, or to an ungreased frying pan that has been preheated over medium heat. Cook them 2 minutes on each side, then 6 additional minutes on each side. Be gentle during these first few flips, so the muffins don't deflate! Cook six minutes more on each side, then up to an additional 4 minutes on each side, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of a muffin registers 190F. Remove them from the griddle and cool on a wire rack.

NOTES : This recipe from King Arthur out-Thomas's Thomas's.  I have been using this recipe for almost two years and have never had a failure.  They are fantastic.

Who doesn't love English muffins? Homemade sourdough ones seem even more scrumptious, and some of the taste-testers here had to admit that these crusty, chewy and tangy gems were the best they'd ever eaten. Quite a compliment, we confess, so we hope you and your family and friends agree. Especially if you've never made English muffins before, go for it; they're a cinch and great fun because you can watch them rise before your very eyes as they cook. With these you might even be able to resist the urge for slathered-on butter. Wow! (When else does that happen?) These freeze really well, too.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  Spelt Flour
  1               Tbsp  Baking Powder
  1              Pinch  Salt

     1/2          cups  Soy Milk -- lite
     1/2           Tsp  Margarine -- melted

A melt-in-your mouth texture will make these a favorite breakfast treat. Experiment with adding basil, dried onion, and oregano for herbed biscuits, or raisins, finely chopped nuts, and orange juice (instead of soy milk) for a sweet version.

Heat oven to 450F. Grease a lg baking sheet. In lg bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. With pastry cutter or two knives, cut in margarine until mixture resembles fine crumbs.

Stir in soy milk until a soft dough forms and mixture pulls away from sides of bowl; do not overmix.

Turn dough out onto generously floured board. Knead gently (about 10 times). Pat dough out to between 1/4- and 1/2" thick. Cut with 2-1/2" biscuit cutter. Re-roll and cut scraps until remaining dough is used. Place on baking sheet and brush with melted margarine.

Bake biscuits about 10 min. or until very lightly browned. Serve warm or at room temp.

I have used spelt for several years.  I have found that Vita-spelt flour has better results in bread than some other brands but I have not done  extensive research on all brands.  They (Purity Foods) check each load of spelt grain that comes in to make sure it is bread quality.  You can go to their website and find lots of recipes for all kinds of foods.  They also have pastas and "white" spelt flour.  By using a search engine you can find some other recipes also.  One thing I quickly learned is that you need about 1/4 cup less liquid with spelt than with wheat flour.  If you would like some other recipes I have adapted contact me by email.

This is the recipe I always use for pancakes.  I adapted a whole wheat recipe from More with Less Cookbook.  Now my kids complain if I do it differently.

Mix dry ingredients with wet ingredients until moist.  Allow to set for several minutes while griddle heats then make pancakes and enjoy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3           cups  Arrowhead Mills Spelt Flour
  1                Pkg  Yeast
  2               Tbsp  Vegetable Oil
  2               Tbsp  Honey
  1                Tsp  Salt
  1               cups  Warm Water

I have not made this recipe using a bread machine, but making it by hand was a cinch and was pretty good. This is a spelt bread recipe and you can find it sold in package form from Arrowhead Mills; e.g. SPELT FLOUR. I am submitting both the bread machine and manual method.  This recipe appears on the Spelt Flour package.

Place in bread machine according to manufacturer's instructions.  Bake on shortest cycle possible (NOT quick bread cycle).  If loaf falls and craters during baking cycle, decrease water slightly next time.

FOR BAKING IN THE OVEN Use same ingredients as above. Preheat oven to 350F.  Dissolve yeast in water with honey and vegetable oil.  Add salt and 1 1/2 cups spelt flour.  Beat well for 3 or 4 minutes.  Cover with damp cloth and let sit for in warm place for approx. 30 minutes or until doubled in size. Add remaining flour turning onto floured board to knead. Knead until smooth adding (more) flour if necessary.  Place in oiled loaf pan, cover with damp cloth and let rise in warm place until doubled in size (approx. 30 minutes).  Bake for 30-40 mins. or until golden brown.

Yield: 1 loaf

Source: Arrowhead Mills, available at Fresh Fields (Whole Foods).

Note: Fresh Fields also sells spelt flour in bulk form.

BROWN RICE RECIPES...There is a company, Fearn Natural Foods, that distributes a mix called "Brown Rice Baking Mix." I purchased this box from Fresh Fields but have yet to try these recipes. On the back of  package the company gives recipes for BREAD (not) yeast bread, but with no other type flour, PANCAKES, WAFFLES, and WHEAT-FREE THIN CRUST PIZZA (again, no yeast). Not only is this mix wheat free but gluten free also.

  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  toasted wheat germ
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

  1 1/2           cups  canned pumpkin -- *
     1/4           cup  milk

1) heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.

2) put all ingredients in a large bowl and mix with an electric mixer or by hand with a wooden spoon. When thoroughly mixed, spread batter in prepared pan.

3) bake 60-65 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

4) remove pan from oven and place on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove loaf from pan and cool completely on a wire rack. Tightly wrapped in aluminum foil, loaf keeps well in refrigerator or freezer.

makes one loaf

they suggest making it a day before serving to allow the flavors a chance to blend, but I usually serve it the next day.

* if you make the mistake, as I did, of buying the caned pumpkin _pie_ filling, do _not_ add the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger or cloves - the pie filling is already properly seasoned for this recipe. The can usually comes in a 30 ounce size, so my suggestion is to make 2 loafs (double all the other ingredients except the seasonings) and freeze one or give it away.

this recipe is from "The Redbook Breadbook", copyright 1977 by the Redbook Publishing Company. There are no authors credited, just the editor, Elizabeth Alston.

NOTES : When my two sons were little and would go to the pumpkin farm,I'd use this recipe to "use" their pumpkin innards. In reality, I just threw away the little bit of pumpkin we scooped out and used canned pumpkin, but I told them it was their pumpkin's innards. Of course,I sent them to bed before I baked this so they wouldn't see the canned pumpkin...

anyway, I thought it was a strange thing to make in August, but I wanted it and it went over well with my co-workers on Saturday.
