  1                  C  Frothy Starter
  2                     Eggs
  2               Tbsp  Oil -- Or

                        To Make Thick Pancake-Like Batter
  1                Tsp  Baking Powder
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda

These are the lightest, best tasting ones I have ever had.

Mix all ingredients except baking powder and soda in a large bowl and let sit for several hours until very bubbly. Stir in baking powder and soda at last minute. Brush each section of the heated ableskiver pan with ample butter. Fill the molds 3/4 full with batter and cook over medium flame until batter swells and a crust starts to form. Use a wooden skewer or knitting needle to pierce the crust and flip each pancake, letting the batter spill into the mold to form the sphere. It will take a little practice to develop your flipping technique. Continue cooking until done. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar and berry jam on the side.

Soft
Coat the loaf with butter immediately after baking by brushing on melted butter or rubbing with a stick of butter or rubbing with your saved butter wrappers.

Dark soft
Brush loaves with milk or cream near the end of baking.

Slashing
"Split-top" is an effect on pan baked bread that is trickier than it looks. The dough must be perfectly risen; the slash must be made one second before putting the pan in the oven; use a perfectly sharp razor blade (it will dull quickly.) If any of the above are questionable, forget it: a poorly slashed loaf looks terrible. Make the slash about 1/2 inch deep. Diagonal slashes in french-type breads are made with the blade held almost parallel to the top of the bread, cutting under the surface, not deeply vertical.

Crisp "french-style"
Bake the bread in a steamy oven for the first 20-30 minutes. There are many ways to steam an oven, the easiest is to spray water on the oven floor and sides and quickly close the door. Do this at intervals. Be careful not to spray the light bulb; it will burst. Spray the loaf as well for extra crispness.

Glossy, warm brown, crisp "Vietnamese french-style" Brush loaves before baking, or during baking, with an egg yolk wash.

History, biology and nutrition:
Bread yeasts are one-celled fungi found all around us, in our kitchens and outside, in the air, in the soil, and on grains, fruits and vegetables. People have been capturing and propagating these wild yeasts for thousands of years in sourdough starters. Scientific breeding of our domestic strains of bread yeasts really started with Louis Pasteur in the 1800s.

Bread yeast ferments carbohydrates producing alcohol and carbon dioxide gas in the process. The gas bubbles, trapped within the elastic dough are what make dough rise, giving us light flavorful bread. Flavor and texture are not the only benefits. Yeast itself is an excellent source of B-complex vitamins and Thiamine and the action of fermentation makes grains more digestible (these are good reasons to prefer yeasted breads rather than quick-breads as a daily diet.)

Bread yeast is an amazingly versatile and adaptive organism: shut off its oxygen supply and it will still reproduce anaerobically; deprive it of moisture and it will go dormant, but still live. Modern yeast factories capitalize on these characteristics to produce yeast in several forms for the home and professional baker.

Forms of commercial yeast:
You may remember the little foil wrapped cubes of compressed yeast (yeast in a starch medium) that required refrigeration during its 3 week life and needed proofing before use in a recipe. Compressed yeast has been almost entirely supplanted by various kinds of dry yeast (pure yeast that has been air dried into dormant granules) packaged in air tight containers with long shelf lives (look for the "use by" date printed on the package.)

Active Dry Yeast (commonly found brands are Fleischmann's and Red Star) is called active to distinguish it from Nutritional or Brewer's Yeast which is also dry. Nutritional Yeast is dead; it has no leavening power. It may be a nutritious food supplement, but it has no place in breadmaking (The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book says that even a small amount added to dough will decrease the effectiveness of the active yeast and make gummy bread.) Active Dry Yeast is usually sold in those little 3-part envelopes in every grocery store. It requires proofing (dissolving in water) before use.

Rapid Rise Yeast made by Fleischmann's is also sold in envelopes or jars. I have no experience with it, but I think it is a kind of instant yeast, since it doesn't need to be dissolved in water first.

Instant Active Dry Yeast is a new product from Red Star. They have made the granules of their traditional yeast smaller so that dissolving in water is not necessary. I have no experience with it.

Instant yeast is not commonly available in super markets. But it is well worth seeking out at wholesale grocers like Smart & Final or bakery supply houses. Instant yeast is dried at a much lower temperature which keeps more yeast cells alive. It requires no proofing and responds very quickly, rising quite high. This is a professional's yeast. This is the yeast called for in all my recipes on these pages. Commonly available brands are Red Star and Fermipan. Substitution measurements for compressed or active dry yeast are given on the packages.

Why use instant yeast?
A major reason is economy. At $2.00 per pound you could throw most of it away and still save money compared to those little 3-part packages of regular yeast. My total ingredient costs would double if I used the active dry yeast available in the supermarkets. Another reason is convenience: it is always there in the refrigerator, ready to use with no mess or fuss. It lasts more than a year in the refrigerator and longer in the freezer (no need to thaw before using.)

Care and feeding of yeast:
Before use, keep your yeast cool and dry. When the yeast is in a dough or batter, it does best in evenly warm and humid surroundings (75 - 90 degrees.) I will keep growing, at a much slower rate, at cooler temperatures, even refrigerated. If an emergency interrupts your baking session, punch down the dough, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until you can get back to it. Then, transfer the dough to a warm bowl and let it warm slowly to continue rising. This is an emergency method only. But emergencies do occur. There are recipes designed to include overnight rising in the refrigerator. See also The Laurel's Kitchen's Bread Book for detailed directions on using sponges (starter doughs) to adjust rising times to fit your schedule. In general, the lower the temperature the slower the rise and the more flavorful and nutritious the bread.

Instant yeast doesn't need proofing but, if you are in doubt about some year old yeast, it doesn't hurt to prove it. Put 1/2 cup of warm water (105-115 degrees) in a bowl or glass container with plenty of room for expansion. Add a pinch of sugar or flour, then sprinkle the yeast and stir to dissolve. I use a knife for stirring; it's easier to clean than a spoon. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. If it still hasn't foamed up after 15 minutes, discard. Yeast does not need to be fed sugar; it will make its own sugars from flour. Yeast doesn't like honey, but will tolerate it mixed in with the other ingredients of the dough. Yeast does better with a succession of rising periods rather than one long one. Each time you punch down the dough and briefly knead it, the yeast is exposed to new food.

Measuring yeast:
You do not need to be exact in measuring yeast. Remember it's going to multiply like crazy anyway. A little less is fine; the dough will rise more slowly and may taste better. I wouldn't increase the yeast measurements in the recipes on these pages; they are already at the high end. Way too much yeast will give an unpleasantly yeasty flavor and aroma.

Are You Ready For Sourdough?

I really enjoy making sourdough breads. I haven't yet developed many original recipes, but there are some further down the page. Here are also some thoughts and some links to more information.

In my opinion, it is best to get your feet wet (or just your hands, I hope) making non - sourdough breads using commercial yeast. When you have more experience and a good feel for bread, then by all means try sourdoughs. This may just be another way of saying, "Do what I did."

What is Sourdough?

You may be surprised to learn that sourdough bread may be made of whole wheat or rye or other whole grains as well as white flour; the flavor may be tangy or "sour" or so mild that you would hardly recognize it as "sourdough." The commonality is in the traditional method of allowing the grains' own yeast to develop slowly until there are enough yeast to power the rise of the final dough. This longer fermentation results in improved flavor and nutrition.

To purists sourdough bread is made using no commercial yeast. Others think of sourdough as only a flavoring method and rely on commercial yeast for the final rise. They do this for speed or convenience or because they are following a recipe and don't know there is any other way. I think there is room for both approaches.

What is a starter?

Almost everyone knows that sourdough bread begins with a "starter." There is nothing mystical or magical about the starter; it is merely the vehicle for holding and nurturing the non commercial yeast between baking sessions. It contains yeast, friendly bacteria and the flour and water on which they feed. I recommend that you begin by using a good commercial starter or one from a friend. You will then know that the particular strain of yeast and its companion bacteria are stable and good tasting. With more experience you may want to try making your own starter from scratch. I have heard of making these starters with raisins, grapes, cabbage or other vegetables. Why not just use the yeast that nature provides us clinging to the grains themselves?

It's Easier than You Might Think

You may think sourdough starters are temperamental and troublesome, demanding special containers and regular attention. Not so. Ask yourself how breadmaking survived through the millennia before Pasteur. Do you think it was the arcane province of a select priesthood or the widespread practice of common folks like us? Starters can last for years (even centuries) with minimal care or concern on our part. I confess to neglecting my starters for long periods without negative effects. I use tap water in my starters though I have read that this is a fatal error. No one told that to the starter though.

For years I had tunnel vision when it came to sourdough. I thought only of making hearth breads with only flour, starter, water and salt. I am now using sourdough in many kinds of bread, modifying old recipes; often the only change is an adjustment in liquid to accommodate the wetness of my starter, omission of the commercial yeast, and breaking the process into different stages.

The basic process is to prepare the starter by feeding it and letting it froth, then at the peak of activity, adding water and half the flour in a bowl for what some call a sponge and others call a second starter, then letting this sit until really bubbly (bubbles throughout the batter, not just on top.) Finally the dough is made by adding the rest of the ingredients and kneading, shaping and allowing the final rise before baking. I may never buy yeast again.

The Busy People's Bread

It may take two days to make, but sourdough is more accommodating to work schedules; your attention is required only briefly at long intervals. Meanwhile, you are sleeping, at the job, in school, whatever.

General Characteristics and Tips

Generally sourdough breads have thin, crisp crusts without any special measures on your part.

I have always stressed the importance of good kneading to adequately develop the gluten in flour. Actually, there are also chemical ways to develop gluten. I am told that big commercial bread makers rely on this to make things easier. Sourdough naturally develops strong gluten without as much kneading. So you will find it easier to achieve that perfectly springy dough. And you can make very nice sourdough batter breads.

Because the gluten is so readily developed, I think it's a good idea to use plain old (unbleached) all purpose flour in feeding your starters, especially if you think you might want to make biscuits, pancakes, waffles and the like.

Having said that sourdoughs develop gluten, I must warn you that if the sponge or dough becomes too sour, the gluten will be degraded. This can happen from letting the sponge or dough sit too long at a warm temperature. It is important to try to catch each stage at its peak of yeast activity when it is foaming and bubbling and go on to the next stage.

Rye and whole wheat flours sour more easily than white. So the above caveat about oversouring applies mostly to rye and whole wheat breads. It is actually quite difficult to develop a very sour tasting white bread. Mostly you will make fine flavored white breads that few will instantly identify as sourdough. I once made a whole wheat brad that was sour enough to give me indigestion. Most of it was thrown out. If extra sour sourdough is what you hanker for try Barb Beck's two starter method.

The dough tends to dry out quite easily and should be covered whenever you are not actually working with it. I tend to use more plastic wrap than I ever did before.

The dough is also drying to your skin. Daily baking or handling starters (and the frequent handwashing) can cause dry peeling skin. I wasn't prepared for this, since I usually don't use hand cream. I found a little olive oil on my hands worked fine. I wouldn't want to get hand lotion into the bread dough anyway.

There seem to be more gooey bowls and containers to clean. Use cold water to rinse away most of the goo before washing with hot suds.

Use SD starter in quick breads, like biscuits, pancakes, scones. Sure, they're no longer quick, but there are benefits. You will need less fat. You will use less baking powder and or soda and notice a wonderful absence of chemical odors and flavors. The yeast in SD makes wheat more useable by our bodies, so it is more nutritious. There are some recipes further down this page, but experiment on your own as well.

Sourdoughs International sells starters from all over the world and a book "World Sourdoughs From Antiquity." The book tells the interesting stories of how Ed Wood gathered these starters and how he participated in a National Geographic project to duplicate the ancient bakery that fed the builders of the pyramids. It gives good advice on maintaining and using starters. The recipes include everything from hot dog buns to Christmas stollen. I am a little disappointed in the rye and whole wheat recipes; they are mostly white bread. I wouldn't make his bagels which contain milk and eggs. I like that these recipes nearly always yield enough sponge to make an instant treat of waffles while waiting for the bread.

                        -- 1 Loaf: -- (2 Loaves):
  3                  C  Whole Wheat Flour -- (6 C)
  1 1/2            Tsp  Instant Yeast -- (1 Tbsp)
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt -- (2 1/2 Tsp)

  2               Tbsp  Honey -- (1/4 C)
  2               Tbsp  Oil -- (1/4 C)

Strictly speaking, only flour, water, yeast and salt are required to make bread. Most people like a little sweetener to round out the wheat flavor. The following recipe has a clear wheat flavor; if you like your bread sweeter, that may be because you don't really care for the taste of whole wheat. Try using King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour. It is much milder in flavor and lighter in color, but as nutritious as other whole grain flours.

Start with the one loaf recipe if you are new to kneading. It will take about 10 minutes to knead whereas the two-loaf version will take twice as long.

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl; make a well in the center. In a glass measure or small bowl, mix the honey and very warm water; pour into the flour mixture. Stir to moisten all the flour. Mix in the oil. Mix the dough, in the bowl, with your hand until it is evenly mixed. It will be sticky.

Feel the dough in your hands. Is it dry or difficult to squeeze? Add more water. If it is runny or does not hold its shape, add a little more flour.

Turn the dough out on a lightly floured board and knead until it is smooth and elastic (about 20 minutes for the two loaf version, 10 minutes for one loaf.) Remember that kneading is the key to developing the dough's stretchy gluten, so the dough will expand with the yeast created gas bubbles, producing a high, light loaf.

Shape the dough into a ball; place in a bowl (the one you mixed in is fine, no need to wash it.) Wet a cloth with warm water and wring it out. Use this to cover the bowl to keep the dough from drying out but allowing it to breathe. If you cover the bowl with plastic wrap, the bread will develop more of a "Wonder Bread" character.

Set the dough in a warm place, free of cooling draughts (an unheated oven with pilot light may be perfect.) Let the dough rise for about an hour. Poke the dough in the center with two fingers about 1/2 inch deep. If the depressions quickly begin to fill in, more rising is needed. If the depressions remain, the dough has risen enough. This is called "doubled" as a term of art. It may be more or less than actually double, don't bother measuring the volume.

Redistribute the yeast within the dough by flattening it out and briefly kneading it. You may correct slightly underkneaded dough at this time by longer, more vigorous kneading. Return the dough to its unwashed bowl, recover and let it rise until doubled again. The second rise will take about half the time of the first rise. The second rise is not absolutely necessary, but produces finer texture.

Deflate the dough again; divide in two (unless you're only making one loaf); shape into two balls and let them rest, covered, for about 10 minutes to relax the gluten. If the gluten is not relaxed, your attempts to shape the dough will be futile; it will spring back from any shape you try to impose. Oil your small (not mini) metal loaf pans and begin heating the oven to 350 degrees.

Shape into loaves by pressing the balls, one at a time, into flattish circles with diameters slightly longer than the length of your pans. Roll the circle up like a jelly roll, but tightly, digging your fingers in as you go. Scrunch the ends with your palms and snugly fit the dough (seam side down) into the pan. It should be touching each end of the pan but probably won't fill in to the sides. Cover and let rise until a gentle poke at a corner shows you the dough is very soft and spongy, hardly springing back at all. This will take less time than the last rise. Quickly put the pans in the oven and bake about 50-60 minutes.

To test for doneness, remove a loaf from its pan and tap on the bottom. If it sounds hollow, it is done. If not, return it to the oven and retest at 5 minute intervals. Cool, out of pans, on racks at least until lukewarm before cutting. Cut with a sharp serrated knife using a sawing motion. If you just can't wait and want to cut into a hot loaf, be very careful not to mash down the bread with heavy pressure.

                 *****

1. Use good quality hard wheat unbleached, unbromated flour that has at least 12 grams of protein per cup. (I like King Arthur)

2. Use fresh, quick dissolving active yeast, not rapid rise.

3. Open the machine and check the dough during the first 5 - 10 minutes of the first kneading cycle!!! Even if your manual says not to do it: flour acts as a sponge absorbing moisture on wet days and becoming dehydrated during dry weather. You'll have to adjust for fluctuating humidity and barometric pressure by adding small amounts of flour or liquid to the dough.

4. If you've never made bread before and don't know what dough is supposed to look like, buy a package of frozen bread dough (at your local supermarket), and let it defrost according to the package directions. Place it on a lightly floured surface and play with it until you are familiar with the consistency. This is what you're aiming for in the bread machine.

5. Now, to adjust the dough in your bread machine during the first knead cycle: wait until the ingredients have been kneaded for 3-4 minutes. If the dough looks sticky and wet and is coating the bottom and sides of the pan, then sprinkle in flour, a tablespoon at a time (you may need up to an extra 1/2 cup) while the machine is kneading, until you have a smooth, supple ball of dough. If the mixture is dry and corrugated looking or the dough doesn't hold together then sprinkle in additional liquid, a little at a time, until the dough is smooth and pliable and forms a cohesive ball. If you've wandered away from your machine only to return to find a wet messy glob or a dry desert thumping around in the machine, press stop (you can do this at any time - except if the machine has gone into the bake cycle), add a small amount of flour or liquid and press start. Stick around and make additional adjustments, if necessary, until the dough looks right.

6. I have found that when you are either making dough, or placing the ingredients in the machine to make bread at that time, you can add either the liquids first or the dry ingredients first. The major exception to this is the old dank (no longer made) where the yeast must be placed in the bread pan first in a position farthest away from the kneading blade. When programming ahead make sure to place any dried fruits away from contact with wet ingredients as they will absorb those liquids and throw off the recipe. Extra kneads and extra rise times all contribute to the depth of flavor, character of the crumb and general personality of a loaf of bread. One of the reasons I dislike rapid rise yeast and rapid cycles on the bread machines is that the dough really requires the entire life span of the yeast to become the amazing miracle that is bread. If you are partial to whole grain breads and are winding up with lower loaves than you wish, then try a double knead cycle: place the ingredients in the machine and program for dough or manual. At the end of the final knead reprogram the machine for bread (of Whole Wheat) and press start. You've given the dough an extra work-out to develop the gluten - that will result in a higher loaf. For an even higher loaf you can (if your machine permits) program for a longer rise time, or simply remove the dough from the pan after the final rise cycle (but before baking) transfer it to a bread pan and allow it to raise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Then bake it in the oven. Sweet dough is with lots of butter and eggs also respond well to a second long rise in a cool place. I remove my brioche from the machine after the dough cycle is complete. I place it in a large freezer strength zip lock bag and refrigerate it overnight. Then I place it back in the machine (my Zojirushi has flexible programming), program for 2nd rise and bake. If you can't program your machine this way you can place the dough in a bread pan after you remove it from the machine, give it a long, refrigerated rise, and then bake it in the oven. Even non-wheat and non-sweet dough is can benefit from this extra rise.

Bread Making Terms of Art

Proofing
Professional bakers use this to mean "rising." Originally it meant to prove the effectiveness of the yeast by starting it to grow with a little "food" such as flour or sugar. If the mixture did not bubble up, it was discarded and little time and ingredients were lost (please read about yeast.)

Kneading
There are many styles of kneading. Obviously if various machines like food processors, mixers, bread machines can do it in different ways, so can humans. Basically, you want to pull the dough to develop the gluten. If the dough is very soft and sticky (some sweet breads or french breads) you may start out just flinging it against a lightly floured surface. Usually you push the heel of your hand into the dough, pushing away from you. At first the dough will be sticky and you will instinctively release pressure to keep from getting stuck. As you repeat this motion, turning the the ball of dough after each push, it will become more resilient and lose its stickiness. How long will it take? For one small loaf (about 3 cups of flour) 10 minutes should do it. The usual two loaf recipe will take about 20 minutes. If you are a novice, you might want to start with a white bread because it develops its elasticity much more readily.

Overkneading
Based on my daughter's experiment, I don't believe overkneading by hand is possible. She deliberately tried to overknead and gave up after more than one hour. So don't worry about it. If you need the exercise or meditative state this repetitive activity can create, keep going; it won't hurt the bread.

Smooth and elastic
This is the condition that seems to occur magically after adequate kneading. The dough feels like a baby's bare bottom, plump and resilient. You may stop kneading at this point.

Double (double in bulk)
This does not mean you need to measure the volume of the dough. Yes, it is roughly double, but more importantly, the dough has risen to the optimal stage where gluten is stretched to capacity without the strands breaking; the yeast is still alive but needs to be redistributed, so it can continue growing. The best test for this state is to poke a finger or two about one-half inch into the dough. If the depression remains, the dough is ready; if it quickly fills in, it needs more rising time; if it starts to collapse, it has gone too far (proceed to the next step in your recipe, but watch it more carefully next time.)

Punch Down (deflate)
Deflate the dough in order to more easily redistribute the yeast or to shape the dough. Bread dough doesn't really require violence but, hey, if that's what you personally need at the moment, go for it. Some authorities say that you should be ever so gentle and just ease the dough from the bowl. In my experience, it doesn't much matter how you do it; just don't tear up the dough.

Redistributing the yeast
A second or third kneading to get more rising power out the yeast and create a finer textured bread. Yeast is a microscopic organism. It does not wander about like an animal; it stays put like a plant. It doesn't grow much in the sense of enlarging its size, but it multiplies like crazy under proper conditions. Fresh food (the starches and sugars in your dough) is brought in contact with the yeast when you deflate the dough and briefly knead it.

Sounds hollow when tapped
The test for doneness after baking. This is another condition, like "smooth and elastic," that may worry you the first time, but once you hear that hollow sound you will recognize and remember it. It's a bit like trying to find a stud in a wall--you keep tapping and wondering if you are even going to know when you do hear it. Relax, you'll know. What if you are deaf? Insert a thermometer and look for an internal temperature of 200F.

Hearth Breads
Breads that are baked without pans directly on the floor of the wood fired oven. In our kitchens that usually means putting the loaf on preheated tiles on an oven rack in the lowest third of the oven. Pizza stones are another option. I've never tried then because my reading has led me to believe their expense is not worth it. I use tiles. Another option is a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan, preheated with the oven. Using two pans nestled together gives further insurance from a burnt bottom. Corn meal is often used to keep the dough from sticking. Only a small amount is needed. I often prefer to use semolina or rice flour instead of cornmeal.

                 *****

Don't reduce the salt in a recipe. It is needed not just for flavor, but to regulate the yeast.

Use small loaf pans (8 1/2" x 4 1/2") for high rounded loaves. Baked in larger pans, the shape and texture will be disappointing. If you only have large pans, make a bigger batch using 7 or 8 cups of flour. Do not use glass pans: temperatures will need to be adjusted; you will get burnt crusts and underdone insides and, if the bread sticks (and it will) you will have a miserable time trying to get it out of the unyielding pan.

Much of the flavor we experience comes from the crust, especially in small loaves and rolls. Sesame seeds on the outside will give more sesame flavor than seeds in the dough. A buttery crust makes a luxurious impression.

Look at the Nutrition Facts label before buying wheat flour. Gluten is protein: look for the highest protein flour. Low gluten flour can be boosted with Vital Wheat Gluten found in health stores.

Use instant yeast (NOT "Rapid Rise") for economy and ease in use. Buy it at Smart and Final or similar stores in one pound vacuum packs for about $2.25. Store in glass jars, tightly sealed, in the refrigerator or freezer (use directly from the freezer, without thawing.) It will last more than one year. Mix with flour, rather than dissolving in liquid first. Add warmer water (110 - 120F) to your dough. Whichever kind of yeast you use NEVER mix it directly with fats or fatty liquids such as milk or eggs. Yeast grows better when at least half the flour is added before any oils or salt.

     1/8      teaspoon  pepper
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2          teaspoons  water
  1                     egg white

1 Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl; stir well. Add 1 cup very warm water and 1 tablespoon oil; stir until well blended. Add 1-1/2 cups flour; stir until a soft dough forms.

2 Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

3 Punch dough down, and roll into a 15- x 10-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Combine parsley and next 7 ingredients in a bowl; stir well. Spread parsley mixture evenly over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch margin around edges. Roll up dough, starting at long side, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch ends and seam to seal. Place roll, seam side down, on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Using a sharp knife, make 1/4-inch-deep diagonal slits 3 inches apart across top of loaf.

4 Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg), free from drafts, about 35 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Combine 2 teaspoons water and egg white, and gently brush over dough. Bake at 375 deg for 30 minutes or until loaf is golden and sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 1 loaf, 16 servings (serving size: 2 [1/2-inch] slices).

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18                oz  Yeast
  1                 qt  Warm water -- 105-110 F.
  2               cups  Honey
  27               lbs  High Gluten Flour
  17                lb  Rye Flakes
  8 1/2             oz  Salt
  2                lbs  Margerine
  1 1/4            qts  Molasses -- Black Strap
  1 1/4            qts  Molasses -- Regular Crosby
  2                gal  Water

1. Heat a 4 qt steel bowlwith hot(140 F. plus) tap water. Pour off water and mix the following ingredients:First amount of water(105-110 F.), honey and yeast. Use a wire whip to incorporate thoroughly. Set aside and allow yeast to activate

2. Warm Hobart mixing bowl with hot tap water 140F.plus temperature.

3. Warm the molasses.

4. Warm the flour and rye by placing it in a bowl next to the oven.

5. While the yeast is activating, weigh and place into the mixing bowl in the following order: rye flakes, flour, salt and margerine.

6, Measure 2 gallons of hot tap water(140 F.) Add 1 gallon to flour mixture. Mix for 2 minutes then add the yeast/water mixture to Hobart bowl. Mix at first speed.

7. Add molasses and second gallon of water. Use second gallon of hot water to rinse out molasses container.

8. Mix on speed #1 for 5 minutes

9. Turn Hobart mixing speed up to #2 and mix for 8 minutes. To check if dough is properly mixed watch as the hook passes through and works the dough. The dough should move completely off the sides of the bowl and be balled around the hook. The dough will have a tacky appearance and all dry ingredients will be in corporated with none on the sides or bottom of the bowl.

10. Lower the bowl, remove the dough hook and cover bowl with a plastic bag. Allow dough to rise and double in size (about 30-40 minutes)

Forming Loaves
1. When the dough has risen and doubled in size, remove onto a table which has been sprayed with Vegaline.

2. Cut dough into 8 lb. chunks. Form loaves in football like shapes measuring about 15 " long x 12" wide x 6" high. Form loaves by folding dough under and inward. Place formed dough on a parchment paper lined sheet tray-2 per tray.

Proofing
1. Place trays in warm place in kitchen or proof box to rise. Proof box setting should be on 120 F. dry heat. Proof until dough has risen to 1 and 1/2 times its size.(about 20-30 minutes). Test risen dough by lightly pressing your index finger into the side of the loaf. If indentaytion stays in bread, the loaf has risen to its potential.

Baking
1. Remove bread from proofing box and place in convection oven. Bake at 315 F. for 1 hour and 15 minutes.


2. Remove bread from oven and place on tray rack to cool. Allow to cool for 2 hours before placing on display racks.

This was an excellent bread with a great rise, a good crust and a good texture to the bread itself. I would appreciate it if some one is familiar enough with bread recipies to be able to reduce this one to two or three loaves. Incidentally, I do not use a bread machine.

Most cornbread is wonderful hot but gets dry and scratchy when cold. This cornbread can be eaten cold as well as hot.

Stir together the starter, milk, cornmeal and flour and let it sit, covered, in a cool place overnight. Heat an oiled iron skillet or a cake pan in the oven at 400F. When the oven and pan are really hot, stir the egg, oil, salt, sugar, baking powder and soda into the batter. Pour the batter into the hot pan and pop it into the oven to bake until done, about 25-30 minutes.

NOTES : Yogurt serves several funcions in this bread. It tenderizes the dough while reducing the fat needed, holds moisture and extends the shelflife of bread.

If using a Kitchen Aid mixer this recipe will require a Heavy Duty
(325 w) model or stronger.

Weight and form of each loaf can be completely individual. I personally chose Free-form, but loaf pans could work properly. By weight for an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 would be recommended at 18 oz.

  2               cups  whole-wheat flour
  1                cup  rye flour
  1                cup  cornmeal

  1         tablespoon  salt -- (or less)
  1            package  dry yeast -- dissolved in
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        -- (finger comfortable)
  1                can  College Inn Brand Chicken stock -- (14-1/2 oz.).
                        -- water to make 2 cups

  1                     egg beaten -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  milk

(Makes about 200 biscuits)

In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Add the dissolved yeast and the chicken stock and egg mixture. Beef stock could be used in place of chicken. Mix together and knead into a stiff dough. As in pie dough, if particles won't come together, add more chicken stock or water to make a firm but pliable dough.

Divide dough and roll into sheets 1/4 inch thick. Cut into shapes with a cookie cutter or just into squares. Place on a baking sheet.

Since there is no need to let them rise beforehand, put the biscuits directly into a 300 deg.oven for 45 minutes, turn off the heat and leave them overnight. In the morning they are bone-hard, guaranteed to clean a dog's teeth in hours.

NOTES : I came across this recipe in Bernard Clayton's NEW COMPLETE BOOK OF BREADS, simply titled "Dog Biscuits". His comments re: nutritional value, etc.are on pages 716-17. The recipe can be customized to your dogs needs and your creativity. They are even good tasting people food. But watch out for your crowns and fillings. For doggie choppers they are great, but caution is advised when you sample.

King Arthur Flour makes a good sturdy bone shaped cookie cutter (I emphasize "sturdy" because the dough contains a lot of rough grains and isn't easy to cut with ordinary cookie cutters, i. e. plastic, etc.). For friends with canine pets, I make small gift bags at Christmas with the bone or doggie shaped cutters. For good eating anytime, scored in squares before baking is just fine. Dogs love 'em any way, shape or form.

Extra Sour Sourdough Bread

> From a message posted by Barb Beck at news:rec.food.sourdough

Most bread baked from sourdough starters is intended NOT to be very sour. If you read old cookbooks you find that people went to great length to avoid sour bread. It was some crazies in the SF Bay area that started producing not only a fine Mild sourdough loaf but also the extra sour stuff.

The trick to making the extra sour stuff seems to be to leave the starter at room temperature or warmer for an extended time. I feed mine each day. It takes a stable starter to do this. The Goldrush starter is too unstable, Carl Griffiths and the SDI starters work well. It takes weeks for the full flavor to develop. By leaving it out the beasties get the upper hand, making the culture quite sour. This also tends to suppress the yeast and if you are not careful the bread does not rise well. I find that giving the starter an extra feeding the day before use usually gets the yeast back into shape.

The other method which I now use is the 2 starter method where I use 1 1/2 cups of the extra sour starter to make a sponge the evening before baking and 1/2 cup of a refrigerated starter which was brought out and fed the day before. (For 2 loaves of bread I use 1 1/2 cup of sour culture 2 cups of bottled water and 2 cups of flour for the sponge. The next day I add the 1/2 cup of the starter activated from the refrigerator, 1 tablespoon of salt and enough flour to make the dough. I form into loaves immediately, let rise at about 88 degrees F and bake.) Note: the pot of sour starter usually has between 2 and 12 cups of starter in it.

Each starter has its own unique flavor which is intensified by letting it sour. It has been interesting playing with my collection of yeasties and beasties to see how their flavor develops with time.

Prepare pizza peel or baking sheet by sprinkling lightly with corn meal.

Remove dough to flat, floured board. Divide into two equal-sized pieces. Using tips of fingers, gently pat down dough to about 1/4-1/2" thick. The shape does not matter -- I have used square, rectangular, and oval shapes. Gently place shaped piece on pizza peel or baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal. Repeat for the other piece of dough.

Place pizza peel or baking sheet in a warm, draft-free location until dough pieces are puffy, about 25-30 minutes. Using end of wooden spoon, make depressions in dough. Brush lightly with olive oil. If using topping ingredients, sprinkle them on at this time.

Turn oven down to 400 degrees (375 if using convection) Fahrenheit. Place dough pieces on heating baking stone in oven; bake for approximately 13-15 minutes, or until bread is golden brown.

Remove to cooling racks and cool briefly before slicing. If freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 2 hours).

INGREDIENT ADDITIONS:
1)  dried spinach & feta cheese (available from King Arthur Baking Co.)
2)  sliced black olives, drained
3)  herbs (e.g., rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano)
4)  crushed red peppers
5)  dried onion flakes
6)  sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
7)  dried bell peppers, chopped
---
TOPPINGS:
1)  crushed red peppers
2)  herbs (e.g., rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano)
3)  coarse salt

                Rolls                           White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pkg.  Dry yeast
  1                 C.  lukewarm water -- (<90 degrees)
  1                 T.  Salt
  1                 T.  Sugar
  3                 C.  water
  4                  C  flour
  3                     beaten eggs
  1                 C.  shortening -- melted
                        -- (I use butter)
  1                 C.  sugar
  6               cups  flour -- approximately

Combine yeast and 1C. of lukewarm water. When this is dissolved, stir in salt, 1T. sugar, 3C. water and 4 C. flour. Beat well until bubble. Cover and set aside at room temperature for several hours or overnight.

After sponge has set, add the beaten eggs, oil (butter), 1C. sugar, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured board and knead. Place in a greased bowl and let rise until double in bulk. Knead down and place in refrigerator. Punch down daily.

When you are ready to use, remove the portion of dough desired from the refigerator and let it stand for 1 hour at room temp. Make out into rolls and put on a greased cookie sheet. Let rise until double in bulk. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 - 20 minutes.

These also make fine twice baked roll.. After you have made out the rolls, let rise until 3/4 as high as you desire (do not let them double, as they continue to rise after they go into the slow oven.) Bake at 275 for 40 minutes. This sets the dough, but does not completely bake it. Store in the refrigerator for a short time, or wrap well and freeze for longer storage. Thaw, if frozen, and bake at 425 for 8 minutes.

I got this recipe from a friend. It makes great cinnamon rolls too with "typical" cinnamon roll filling! I froze my twice baked rolls separately on a cookie sheet and then put them in a zip lock bag. Then, depending on how many I have for supper... I just take out what I need! I wish I could say how long the dough lasts in the fridge, but, my family wants them for dinner every night, so, when I make them, they last about 3-4 days.

  8                Ozs  Soy Beans
                        Vanilla Bean -- not needed if you
                        intend to
                        cook/make tofu with it
  1               Tbsp  Sunflower Oil
  1               Dash  Honey

Soak the beans in plenty of water for 2 days, changing the water twice per day. Liquidize beans with 2.5 pints water. Pour mixture through a sieve lined with muslin, squeezing through as much liquid as possible. Add vanilla pod. Heat liquid to boiling point, then remove vanilla pod.

Add oil and sugar or honey to taste. Liquidize again, then strain through muslin. Its a bit complicated, but personally I think it's worth it - especially when the result is a slab of
undoubtedly homemade tofu!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- divided
                        -- (1 3/4 to 2 1/2)
  1                cup  rolled oats -- uncooked
                        -- (quick or old-fashioned)
     1/2           cup  shredded fresh Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1            package  instant yeast
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds -- coarsely crushed *
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  refrigerated or home-made pesto sauce

* (these are optional, but they taste great so add them)

Lightly spray baking sheet with vegetable oil (canola) cooking spray. Combine 1-3/4 cups flour with the oats, cheese, sugar, yeast, salt, and fennel seeds in a large mixing bowl. Heat water and oil until very warm (120 to 130 degrees). Add warer-oil mixture to flour mixture. By hand, gradually stir until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in enough of the remaining 3/4 cup of flour to make a soft dough that pulls away from the side of the bowl.

Knead dough on a lightly floured surface 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Lightly sprinkle surface and hands with additional flour if dough is sticky.

Roll dough in to a 10-inch circle. Cut into 12 wedges. Spread about 1 teaspoon pesto across each wedge. Tightly roll up each wedge from wide end. Place rolls, seam-side down, on prepared baking sheet; gently push ends down. Cover rolls with damp cloth. Let rise in warm place for 30 minutes.

If desired, after rolls have risen, lightly brush with additional olive oil and sprinkle with additional rolled oats. Bake rolls in preheated 350F oven 20 to 22 minutes, or until light golden brown. Serve warm.

Yield: 12 rolls

Note: Alternatively, you can cut the dough into 3-inch rounds, place a small dollop of pesto in the center, and fold them over a la calzones into half-circle shapes, crimp lightly with a fork, and proceed with the above baking instructions.

                        Sponge:
  2                  C  Starter
                        (Frothing, A Medium Batter Consistency)

  1               Tbsp  Caraway Seed
                        Dough:
  1                  C  Strong Bigelow Orange & Spice Tea -- Or
                        (Other Rose Hip Tea) , Cooled

  3               Tbsp  Oil
  2                Tsp  Kosher Salt
                        Zest Of 1/2 Orange
  3                  C  Rye Flakes -- Optional

This is good all by itself or with split pea or other soups.

The rye flakes are optional. They add chewiness and rye flavor. If you use them, toast them lightly first, either on a baking sheet in the oven or in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. As long as you are toasting the rye flakes, you might as well toast the seeds with them. Watch the flakes closely; they burn easily.

Mix the sponge ingredients and let sit in a large bowl until very frothy and doubled in bulk.

To the sponge, mix in the tea, then the bread flour, sugar, oil and salt. Beat this vigorously by hand or in a mixer until elastic. Remember rye flour has no gluten, so the white flour's gluten must be sufficiently developed to carry the entire loaf. Then stir and knead in the rye flour. Use just enough more white flour to keep from sticking to the kneading surface. Let the rounded dough rest, covered, for ten minutes before the final shaping. Divide into halves; shape and place in two oiled small loaf pans. Let rise until the dough is risen above the top of the pans (if in doubt, under-rising is better than over-rising.) Bake at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes.

  2           packages  active dry yeast
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  lukewarm water
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
                        up to 6 cups flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  milk, lukewarm
  3                     eggs -- beaten

  1              stick  butter, softened -- cut in pieces
  1                     egg -- beaten

Method: Preheat oven to 350F.

In a small bowl, combine yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar, and lukewarm water. Gently stir contents. Cover with a towel and let stand for 10 minutes. Yeast mixture should bubble.

In a mixing bowl, combine flour, nutmeg, and salt. Stir together. Make a well in the center of the flour. Pour in yeast mixture, beaten eggs, softened butter, and milk. Work together into a dough. You may want to use your hands to work the dough together.

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for 10 minutes. Place dough back into mixing bowl, cover with a towel, and allow to rise in a warm place 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.

Remove dough from bowl, punch dough down, and knead for another ten minutes. Split the dough in half and shape into two round loaves. Place loaves on a baking sheet. Brush the remaining beaten egg over the tops of the loaves. Bake at 350 F for 55-60 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown. Remove loaves from oven and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes.

Slice and serve. Makes 2 9" round loaves

Sweet Bread

Inherited from the Portuguese, in the interior of Brazil massa sovada comes scented with the air of nutmeg. Perfect for breakfast, as a simple dessert, or with an afternoon tea.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Eggs
  2                  C  Buttermilk
     1/4             C  Melted Butter -- Or Oil
  1 1/2            Tsp  Baking Powder
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
     1/2             C  Chosen Additions
     1/2             C  Whole Wheat Flour
  1                  C  White Flour -- Unbleached

In a deep bowl (I like to use a Tupperware 2 1/2 quart pitcher/mixing bowl), whisk eggs. Add buttermilk and oil or melted butter and whisk.

In a cup measure, put in a combination of : corn meal, wheat germ, rolled oats (lightly whirred in a spice grinder) barley flour, sliced and roughly chopped almonds (or ground pecans or walnuts or chopped sunflower seeds) or whatever appeals to you. Stop when you get to the 1/2 cup mark (or before, if you want.) Then fill the cup with whole wheat flour.

Dump the baking powder, soda and salt onto the egg/milk mixture, don't mix it in. Dump the flour mixture on top and give a few stirs with the whisk. Then whisk in the white flour, just till moistened, leaving batter a little lumpy. If it is too thick, add a little water. Bake on a well seasoned cast iron or non stick griddle.

Blueberry pancakes: After pouring the batter on the griddle, drop berries (they may be frozen) in the pancake as you want them.

To make waffles: Separate the eggs and whip whites until stiff peaks form. Increase the oil or butter to 1/3 cup. Mix as for pancakes, folding egg whites in at end.

Note: if you have left over waffle batter, bake more waffles and freeze them. If you have left over pancake batter, cover and refrigerate. Sometimes the buttermilk will turn the batter sort of blue overnight (if you used wheat germ in the batter the color will become sort of green rather than blue.) This is OK; it is not spoiled. When baked, the color will not be noticeable.

These can become quite tangy. For milder flavor, keep the batter refrigerated or shorten the rise.

Mix the sponge and let it sit for several hours to develop bubbles throughout. Mix the batter, omitting the soda until just before baking. Let the batter sit overnight. Stir in the soda, dissolved in water, and bake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               tsp.  yeast
  2                cup  white flour -- (8oz)
  1                cup  whole wheat -- (4oz)
  2               Tbs.  dry milk
  1               Tbs.  sugar
  1               Tbs.  dry onion
  2               Tbs.  light olive oil
     1/4           cup  Harvest Grains mixture
                        -- (or any combination of seeds and
                        oatmeal)
  1                     cupwarm water -- plus
  2                Tbs  warm water -- *
                        -- usually microwave 1 min. on high

* (bottled or from the morning tea kettle - chlorine inhibits yeast)

If you measure rather than weigh the flour you will probably need more water. The dough should be soft but not sticky after 5 min of kneading.

5 min before the end of the last kneed, I add 1 tsp salt. Or if you want just dump it in with the rest of the ingredients in the beginning.

Set to dark crust or bake at 400 for 20 to 30 min depending on the shape.

This bread smells great baking because of the milk, has a crisp crust and soft crumb.

  2               cups  flour

To make mix: combine dry ingredients in work bowl of food processor; pulse to blend. Add butter, extract & peels; pulse in brief bursts until mixture resembles corn meal. Transfer to zipper bag & seal. Put dried fruit pieces in small zipper bag and seal. Make instructions to add orange juice & eggs. (If using dehydrated eggs, increase liquid appropriately.)

To bake, combine mix with necessary liquid ingredients; fold in fruit. Divide among 12 muffin cups; bake at 400* about 25 minutes (tester comes out clean).


You can apply the principles to any muffin recipie -- remember, for instance, that applesauce comes in little 1/2 cup containers which are easily packed, if you like apple (bran?) muffins.

NOTES : A tip for Reggie: you can make your own take-along muffin mix by combining everything except wet ingredients, then adding juice/water/milk on site. If you use powdered eggs (or egg whites) you can eliminate the need to buy an odd number of eggs. Here's a recipie which my son makes a couple times a year for holiday and end-of-school gifts. We package the mix in one zipper bag, any add-ins (dried fruit, nuts) in a smaller one, and include a dozen fancy muffin cups. It's a great gift!

     1/2           Tsp  Baking Soda

I was leery of sourdough pancakes. The ones I had tasted many years ago were thick and not very light. Being very fond of buttermilk pancakes, I didn't want to try sourdough; but after my experience with sourdough ableskiver and biscuits, I skeptically turned my hand to pancakes. They were wonderful.

Mix everything except the soda and let sit overnight (if kept in the refrigerator, allow time to come to room temperature in the morning.) Add the soda just before baking on a hot griddle.

  1 1/8              C  Water -- hot tap

Pile everything into the machine in the order listed. Select the bread cycle. Remove at the end of the cooling cycle. The flavors of the
seasonings are most pronounced when the bread is allowed to cool completely.

Variations:

HIGH-SPEED PARTY MIX WHEAT BREAD (Hitachi and Regal machines)

Use 2 t active dry yeast and select the "BREAD RAPID" setting.

PARTY MIX WHITE BREAD

Substitute sugar for the molasses and bread flour for the whole wheat flour. If you object to the strange tint that the Worcestershire sauce will give the dough, use Lea & Perrin's White Wine Worcestershire sauce. Hitachi and Regal owners who want to use the "BREAD RAPID" cycle can use 2 t of active dry yeast.

Sylvia's comments: With WW flour, this barely rose and then cratered.
With all bread flour, it mushroomed. I hoped this would taste like Chex Party Mix; it just tasted like bread. Looked like WW because of the Worcestershire but still tasted white.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour, (up to 2 1/2 cups)
  1                cup  Quaker Oat Bran hot cereal -- uncooked
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper  (up to 1 teas)

                        Ok To Make First Bread Without It
  1                     Egg White

This authentic recipe originated from Hungary. Master Baker Wolcz, has used it for many years. It has been modified and transplanted to Canada in 1994. Making this bread will improve a great deal** with practice, and by adding the dried dough from the previous batch. Success increases when using the right kind of flour.

It's also important to following each step preciously outlined in the recipe.

All ingredients in this recipe are measured in the metric system for international standard. Conversion is enclosed for your reference.

Flour: 1000grams=1kg=2.2 lb. 1cup flour=160grams

Note: For the best results I use an enriched flour named "BIGWhite" from Rogers FOODS Ltd, Armstrong, British Columbia Canada. They sell directly or can give info where is the closest distributor is.

First Step directions:
Mix flour with warm water in a large 15-20 liter plastic or metal bowl. Dissolve yeast and sugar in three tablespoon of warm water in a small warm bowl for 10 minutes. Combine and work with the sponge in the large bowl until it becomes very smooth and soft textured. Cover the bowl with heavy cloth and place it to a warm place for 8-10 hours. It will smell sour and should drop. This means, the sponge will rise first to its fullest, and fall back. The best time is to start it in the evening. Don't let a dry crust to form on top. Hard crust can be softened by soaking it with a little warm milk, and scrape it off from the side of the bowl.

Step two.
Mixing directions:

Again, dissolve the yeast and sugar in three tablespoon of warm water in small bowl for 10 minutes. Mix the mashed-potatoes with dried dough** [left over from last batch dissolved over night in a little bit of water.] Add all milk [warm] and dissolved in a mid sized bowl. Combine with the first sponge in the large bowl until it is soft and smooth and has a consistency similar to the first sponge.

Then add all flour and garlic powder *or seeds* to it. Dissolve the salt into the 0.5 litter warm water [it improves the taste if you use the water saved from boiling the potatoes], and mix it with the rest of the ingredients in the large bowl. Work it over really well, till dough is firm and free from dry flour patches. You may add more warm water if it's need for easier mixing, but dough should not be wet looking. Sprinkle flour on the dough and cover bowl with damp cloth and place it back to a warm place to rise, approx. 1 hr.

Uncover the bowl then punch dough down, Work dough over with a wet hand for a few minutes, then sprinkle it with flour again, cover bowl and place it back in a warm place for 1 hr longer to rise again.

Step three.
Portioning and kneading directions

Take the dough from the large bowl, place it on the counter top sprinkled lightly with flour. Divide in to six equal pieces, [but save out 100 grams dough and store in a small bowl for the next batch]** Take one, knead it than roll it out with the rolling pin, both sides to about 1cm thick and 18cm wide. Roll up the dough, press down the ends so they closed. Place the loaf, seams down into a pre-oil coated pan. [ Approximately. 18cm long 10cm wide, 7 cm high in size.] Do the rest of the loafs, then place pans in a warm place and cover them with a damp cloth. Let them rise above the top of the pan, approx. 45 minutes. You should check if all six pan will fit on one level of your oven's rack. Otherwise cut recipe down to four loafs only.

Step four.
Baking directions

Preheat oven to 375F. [don't turn convection on yet.] Take the egg white and beat it with four tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Uncover pans, make three 1/2 cm deep slits diagonally across the top of the dough with a very sharp knife, or poke four small hole, all the way to the bottom, lengthwise in the center. Brush it thinly with the egg white, and place pans into the preheated oven. Place on the bottom of the oven a pie pan filled with 1cm [1 cup] boiling water, or you just spray water into the oven a few times, if there is no room for a pie pan. Bake the bread for 35 minutes then remove pans and the pie pan too. Coat bread with egg white again, place them back in the oven. Alter the position of the pans in the oven. Reduce heat to 320F [300F if you to use convection oven at this stage.] Bake bread for 45-50 minutes longer until they have a very nice light brown color. Take pans out of the oven, remove bread from the pans and place loafs on a rack. Brush it again with egg white while they still hot. Check if they are baked by knocking on the bottom of the loafs. They should sound deep hollow when baked. Put breads back in oven upside down in the pan for 10 minutes longer if they not fully baked. Wait until the bread is cooled off before you slice it. Now you can enjoy a real European bread.
Place loafs into plastic bags and keep them in the deep freezer for longer storage. For everyday use no refrigeration needed, stays fresh long if kept it in a tight plastic bag.

NOTES : I am making this bread in the old fashion way for years My father was a master baker in Hungary. He give me his secret, how to make this potato, sour, crusty bread, that stays fresh for many days! My family and friends just loves it. It was a little hard to find the right flour. Now it is available.

---
Glad my notes about muffin mix got through...sent this before that one, but perhaps to wrong address. Would really love for Frank to know that his bread is a HUGE hit in Milwaukee. (The next time I made it -- after my husband and son ate through the remarkable yield in just a long week -- I placed most of the dough on the back corner of my butcher block while forming one of the loaves. Imagine my surprise to find it "walking" off of the edge, clearly heading hungrily for the raisins which were waiting to be turned into Christmas breads. Frank .... this is an AWESOME dough!)

  1 1/2              C  warm water
  1 1/8            Tsp  active dry yeast (1 1/2 pkg)
  2               Tbsp  brown sugar
  1 1/8            Tsp  salt
  1                  C  bread flour
  3                  C  regular flour
  2                  C  warm water
  2               Tbsp  baking soda
                        To taste -- coarse salt
  2               Tbsp  butter (melted) -- (2 to 4)

Sprinkle yeast on lukewarm water in mixing bowl; stir to dissolve. Add sugar, salt and stir to dissolve; add flour and knead dough until smooth and elastic. let rise at least 1/2 hour. While dough is rising, prepare a baking doa water bath with 2 C warm water and 2 tbsp baking sode. Be certain to stir often. After dough has risen, pinch off bits of dough and roll into a long rope (about 1/2 inch or less thick) and shape. Dip pretzel in soda solution and place on greased baking sheet. Allow pretzels to rise again. Bake in oven at 450 for about 10 minutes or until golden. Brush with melted butter and enjoy!

For Aunti Anne's famous Cinnamon Sugar, try melting a stickof butter in a shallow bowl (big enough to fit the entire pretzel) and in another shallow bowl make a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Dip the pretzel into the butter, coating both sides generously. Then dip again into the cinnamon mixture.

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
                        -- (100 to 115 degrees F)
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  6 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt -- plus
  2          teaspoons  coarse salt
  1              stick  sweet butter -- (1/2 cup)

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the warm water with the sugar, and let it proof. Combine 6 cups of the flour with the salt in a large bowl. Using two knives, cut the butter into the flour and salt, being careful not to overwork it. Place the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add 1/4 cup warm water. Then add the flour- and-butter mixture, incorporating it with one hand only and using the remaining water to create a stiff, sticky dough. Turn out the dough on a floured board and work it hard for a good 10 minutes: slap it, beat it, punch it, and give it a thorough kneading. When finally smooth, let it rest for a few minutes, then shape into a ball. Place in a well-buttered bowl, turn to coat the surface, cover, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for 1-1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and let rise for 3 or 4 minutes, then knead again vigorously for 3 or 4 minutes. Shape into a ball and put back in the buttered bowl to rise again for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Punch the dough down and let rest for another 3 or 4 minutes. Knead a third time and then shape carefully into a loaf to fit a well-buttered 13-1/2 x 4 x 3-3/4-inch pan. Let rise until almost doubled in bulk, approximately 1 hour. Butter the inside of the lid, if you are using the pullman tin, or butter a piece of foil, cover (weight if you are using the foil), and place in a pre- heated 400 degree F oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 375 degrees F. After 30 minutes turn the tin on one side for 5 minutes and then on the other side for 5 minutes. Set it upright again, and remove the lid; the bread should have risen to the top of the pan. (If using foil and weights, remove both at this point).
*
Continue to bake until it is a golden brown, which will take 12 to 15 minutes more. Turn the loaf out of the pan and put it directly on the rack of the oven to bake for a few minutes longer, until the bread is a beautiful color and sounds hollow when tapped with the knuckles. Let it cool thoroughly on a rack before slicing.

NOTES : This is the white bread frequently used for sanwiches, a four-square loaf that has delicate flavor, a fine crumb, and a good flavor. It is made in a special pan with a sliding lid at the top that keeps the bread in shape as it bakes. If you do not have this type of pan, you can bake it in an ordinary pan, covered with tinfoil and lightly weighted with tiles or similar weights. However, the tins are easily available in restaurant and baking supply houses and are not expensive. This is a beautiful toasting bread and, if correctly made, it can be sliced paper thin. In addition to its excellence for sandwiches and toast, it is useful for croutons, crumbs, rolled sandwiches, little canapes, and hors d'ouevres.

NOTES : I am so excited!!!! In the mail from last week I had an envelope from Gourmet. I figured it was another one of those "Your subscription will be expiring in 5 months, you should resubscribe now..." things. I opened it and it's a recipe I had requested from a resaurant. I live near Colonial Williamsburg, and we had visited there before I got married and the first place we ate was Chowning's Tavern. I fell in love with their rolls, and bought some to take home. I asked there for the recipe with no luck. I've been checking every Williamsburg cookbook and even tried to call their commissary with no luck. I wrote to Gourmet about a year ago asking to see if they could get it. They did and sent it to me!!! I was screaming so loud that hubby thought I had seen a spider! Does anyone have the substitution for the instant yeast with active dry? I thought I had one, but I can't find it. Without further ado here it is:

This is a recipe I developed while trying to mimic a bread I ate at an excellent French restaurant in my area (central NJ). For want of a better name I call it KSB (kitchen sink bread, since everything but goes in it). It has a rye flavor sweetened by the raisons and a soft crumb contrasted by the crunchy seeds. It can be made in a bread machine or by hand. I love this bread which tastes so good, you don't have to put anything on it.

The water will work if the measurements are exact,e.g. 1 c flour = 4 oz,  other wise you usually have to add more water.

  2                Tsp  Gluten Powder

Semolina is not just for pasta. This new bread is a warm golden color and has a good wheat flavor. The crust crisps perfectly without doing a thing to it. The crumb is even and moist, soft but not fluffy. It makes excellent toast.

Mix together the semolina, Malt-o-Meal, sugar, malt, yeast and water. Add egg, oil and salt. Mix until smooth. Then mix in one cup of the flour and beat until smooth and elastic. Knead in the last flour by hand or use the dough hook of a heavy duty mixer. Knead well, about 15 minutes by hand. Form the dough into a ball and let it rise in the bowl, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours. It will more than double. Test by pressing two fingers into the dough. Deflate and let rise again in the bowl.

This will make two large pan loaves or four 12" long free formed loaves. Divide dough accordingly. Let rest and shape. Let rise in pans or on peel for about 30 minutes, until properly soft. Make several diagonal slashes across the tops with a razor blade held almost horizontal. Place immediately in a steamy 425F oven. After 15 minutes, rearrange loaves in the oven and reduce temperature to 375F. Bake an additional 15 minutes for the small loaves or 30 minutes for the large pan loaves.

  1                  C  White Bread Flour
  1                  C  Whole Wheat Flour

Mix the sponge and let sit in the bowl until bubbly and about doubled. This may take several hours or overnight.

Add the dough ingredients and mix until it becomes difficult to continue. Dump out onto your kneading surface and knead in the last flour plus additional flour to keep from sticking. When dough is smooth and elastic, shape and place in a large buttered loaf pan. Cover with buttered plastic wrap and let rise until very light and risen above top of pan. Slash vertically (split-top style) and place in cold oven. Turn oven to 400 degrees and bake until done (about 50 minutes.) I only recently realized that most pan breads can be started in a cold oven. This is especially nice in summer and conserves energy anytime of year.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge
  2 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Dough
     3/4           cup  milk -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sponge
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sea salt

To make the sponge: Mix the instant yeast with the flour and stir in the water using a wooden spoon until you have a batter-like dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes.

To make the dough: Beat the olive oil and the milk into the sponge with a wooden spoon. Mix the flour and the salt, and add to the sponge mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon. Knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 8 to 10 minutes until the dough is velvety and sticky.

First rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven with a baking stone inside.

Second rise: Generously oil (olive, of course) an 11- x 17-inch baking pan. Place the dough in the pan, press it as far toward the edges as it will go, and cover with a towel. After 10 minutes, stretch it again to the edges, cover, and let it rise for 20 more minutes.

Note: At this point, you may top it with the toppings of your choice or bake it as is after dimpling it with your fingertips, drizzling a little oil over it, and sprinkling coarse salt.

Baking: Set the baking pan directly on the baking stone and bake until crispy and crunchy, about 22 to 30 minutes. The oven should be preheated to 425F with the baking stone inside.

                Miscellaneous & Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For The Dough:
  1               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast
  3                  C  All-Purpose Flour -- Unbleached
  1               Tbsp  Lora Brody's Bread Dough Enhancer
  3               Tbsp  Lora Brody's Bread Dough Relaxer
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  3               Tbsp  Vegetable Oil
  1                  C  Water -- Note 1

Yield: 12 large pretzels or 18 smaller pretzels

Note 1: 1 1/3 cups water to make a soft, supple dough after the first few minutes of the first knead cycle

Bread machine method:

Place all the ingredients in the bread machine and program for dough, basic dough or manual. Check the dough during the first few minutes of the first knead cycle to correct for flour/water as necessary to make a soft, supple ball. At the end of the final cycle remove the dough to a lightly floured work space.

Stand mixer method: use the dough hook.

Mix the dry ingredients together on low for 2 minutes. Add enough water to make a supple ball after the first few minutes of kneading on medium speed. Continue kneading on medium speed for 5-7 minutes until the dough is elastic. Cover and allow to rise until double in bulk.

Food processor method: use the plastic blade.

Add the dry ingredients to the work bowl. With the machine on add the water through the feed tube until a ball forms. Process for 40 seconds. Rest for 5 minutes, then process for 60 seconds. Cover and allow the dough to rise until double in bulk. Punch down the dough, form it into a ball and cover with a clean towel and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Oil two heavy duty baking sheets. Divide the dough into 12 or 18 equal pieces and shape each one into a rope 12 or 9 inches long. You may have to allow the ropes to relax for several minutes during this process before they will stretch completely. Form each rope into a loose pretzel-shaped knot. Place the pretzels on the prepared baking sheet, cover with a clean towel and allow to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until almost doubled in bulk. To complete: 1 egg white mixed with 1 tablespoon water coarse or Kosher salt Brush the tops of the pretzels with the egg white. Bake for 20 minutes or until deep golden brown. Cool 15 minutes before eating.

Categories    : Bread Machine                   Bread-Bakers Mailing List
                Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  honey -- or light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  butter -- or shortening
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- up to 2 tablespoons
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
  1              large  egg

Bread Machine Method: Scald the milk, and let it cool to lukewarm. Place all of the ingredients, including the lukewarm milk, into the pan of your bread machine in the order directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Program the machine for manual or dough, and press start. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. If the dough isn't doubled by the end of the cycle, allow it to remain in the machine for 30 minutes more, or until it's doubled.

Shaping: Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface and knead briefly, then divide it into 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, and let the balls rest, covered, for 15 minutes. Roll each ball into an 8-10 inch round; the dough will be very thin.

Heat a griddle or heavy non-stick pan over medium heat. Lightly brush the pan with oil. Dry-fry each bread for 1 1/2-2 minutes per side; the breads should remain mostly white on the first side, and have small brown patches on the second side. Transfer each round to a rack to cool, then wrap tightly to store.

NOTES : These breads may also be baked in a hot (475F) oven; place them on a baking sheet, or directly on a baking stone.

Kate asked for a bread similar to the Gordita by Taco Bell. I too love that bread but the closest recipe I could ever find was this one from Wendy's. I think the recipe came from this list a while ago.

Waffles made with sourdough are light and crisp whether baked as Belgian or traditional waffles. They're perfect for topping with fruit and are especially nice because they require far less fat, only a couple tablespoons of oil or melted butter in a large recipe. They smell great, like bread.

There's hardly need for a recipe; almost anything works. You can make them without milk; you can beat the egg whites separately or just throw in the whole eggs; they will still be light. Use whole wheat or multigrain or white flour. The batter can sit for quite a while or be used right away, just be sure to add the soda just before baking. Basically, you add milk and eggs and a little oil or melted butter to your basic sourdough sponge (this may be leftover from a bread recipe.) I'd use 1 egg and 1 Tbsp oil for one cup of sponge; double that for two cups of sponge. Then add enough flour to make the waffle batter consistency. Let it sit to bubble some more. Just before using the batter, add the soda, 1/2 to 1 tsp, depending on whether the amount batter and whether it contains buttermilk. The soda mixes in more readily if you first dissolve it in a small amount of water.

Patterned after the classic dessert of the same name, this orange-scented strawberry-studded bread is the perfect foil for the following Strawberry Devonshire Cream. Measure the flour by stirring it, loosely spooning it into the measuring cup, then leveling off with a the back side of a knife. Because cold ingredients slow the leavening action, it's ideal to have the eggs and sour cream at room temperature. "Zest" is the outer colored portion of any citrus peel-the whitish pith below it is bitter. Overmixing creates a tough, coarse-textured quick bread so TLC is in order.

Grease an 8- x 4-inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and allspice; set aside. In the small bowl (if you have two sizes) of an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beating at medium speed, add eggs, one at a time, then beat in sour cream, vanilla and orange zest. Add to flour mixture, stirring only until dry ingredients are moistened. Gently fold in strawberries. Turn into prepared pan; smooth surface. Bake 60 to 65 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand in pan 10 minutes before turning out onto rack to cool completely.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         Tablespoon  Active dry yeast
  2        Tablespoons  Sugar
  2        Tablespoons  Dry milk, nonfat
  1         Tablespoon  Fresh gingerroot, grated
  1           Teaspoon  Orange rind, grated
  1           Teaspoon  Coarse salt
     1/8      Teaspoon  Nutmeg, grated
  2        Tablespoons  Butter, soft
     3/4           Cup  Sweet potato, mashed
  3 1/2           Cups  Flour, all - purpose
  1                     Egg, beaten w/ 1 tsp water
                        Sesame seeds

In a medium - size bowl dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of lukewarm water. Combine the sugar and dry milk with 1 cup of warm water and add to the yeast along with the grated ginger, orange rind, salt, and nutmeg. Whip the butter into the mashed potatoes and combine with yeast mixture. Stir the flour in and then beat the mixture for 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place over a pan of warm water to rise until double in volume, about 45 minutes.

Tum out onto a floured work surface, punch down, and knead very lightly a few turns. Pull off pieces of dough slightly smaller than a Ping - Pong ball and, since they will be very sticky, just roll lightly with floured hands to form a ball. Arrange on one or two greased baking sheets large enough to hold the three dozen rolls side by side without crowding. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Paint with the beaten egg and sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 25 minutes. Serve warm.

  2            packets  instant dry yeast

     1/2           cup  very warm water
                        ---
  1 1/4           cups  warm milk

  5                     eggs (room temperature) -- beaten to blend
  1                box  raisins -- (15 oz)
  1                cup  butter
                        -- (soft - at room temperature)
  1               tsp.  lemon extract
                        ---
  6               cups  flour -- (6 to 7)

Proof yeast in warm water; dissolve sugar and salt in warm milk. Combine yeast & milk mixtures, whisk in eggs. Add raisins, butter, extract, and enough flour to form a kneadable dough. (The butter will incorporate itself as you work in the flour, IF it was nice and soft to begin with.) Let the dough rest, covered with the work bowl, 15 minutes.

Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. (This is a lovely dough to work with, much like Challah, very rich and smooth.) Let rise until double in bulk; press down, turn over and let rise again until doubled. As the dough is very rich in eggs & butter, the rise times can be pretty long ... be sure the dough is in a warm, draft-free place and covered.

Shape into loaves or rings. Let rise to the top of the pan. Bake approximately 50 minutes, until well browned. (This dough is so heavy that the "sounds hollow when tapped" isn't as distinctive as it is with regular doughs.)

This is great served warm or toasted. Grandpa (who endured a variety of dietary restrictions in his old age) carefully meted himself one piece each morning, dipping every bite carefully into his coffee before enjoying. Have fun with it!

NOTES : Here's a really old family recipe you can try. My great-grandfather John Bender immigrated to Washington DC from Germany in the mid-to-late 1800's. He established a bakery in "Foggy Bottom" and I'm fortunate to have quite a number of his recipies (written out in his own hand). Now that I have a place to share, I'll try to get back into them and decode them for home use. MEANWHILE, here's a great raisin bread recipie that my grandfather (John's son) made well into his 80's. He always baked it in a flared, fluted tube pan, but I'm sure it will taste fine baked in a loaf. The dough is VERY rich and heavy, be sure to let it rise in a warm place or, for your first try, make it on a nice warm day. You may be tempted to use white raisins, but the traditional dark ones make a lovely pattern against the rich yellow bread.

NOTES : This bread can cool in the machine and only gets slightly moist on the outside crust. So it can be started before bed and removed in the morning.

It makes a medium-dark brown bread that is very similar to that served in Outback Restaurants. The use of molassas instead of sugar makes the bread more moist and more brown, and imparts a very slight molasses flavor

The use of vegetable spray allows the bread to more easily slide from the pan, but is not absolutely required.

The use of potassium sorbate reduces the rise of the bread by about 1/4 to 1/3, but retards mold growth for at least one week. Otherwise bread molds in a few days.

The use of applesauce instead of shortning works, but the bread dries out faster, regardless of how well it is sealed.

                        For The Sponge:
  2                  C  Fully Frothing And Bubbly Sd Starter
  2                  C  Cool Water
  1                  C  All-Purpose Flour
  2                  C  King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour
                        For The Dough:
     1/4             C  Flax Seed Meal
     1/3             C  Whole Grain Corn Meal -- Note 1
  3               Tbsp  Oil
     1/4             C  Honey
  4                  C  King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour
  2 1/2            Tsp  Salt
                        Additional Flour -- As Needed

Using a rye-whole wheat starter will give this bread a more pronounced tang. Or use a plain white starter for milder flavor.

Note 1: (I like Arrowhead Mills Hi-Lysine)

Mix sponge ingredients in a large bowl. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit until very bubbly and doubled in volume.

Mix in the flax meal, corn meal, oil and honey. Add the flour gradually until you can't mix by hand any longer. Knead in remaining flour and then knead in the salt in two portions. Form into a ball and let sit for 20 minutes, covered. Knead some more (remember, this is whole wheat and requires good long kneading) until smooth and elastic, adding flour as required.

Divide in two and shape into loaves. Brush the loaves completely with oil and place in large (9"x5") oiled pans. Cover with floured towel and let rise until above the pan. Slash tops with three diagonal cuts (straight down; not like baguettes) and put in a preheated and steamed oven at 400F. After 10 minutes, lower heat to 350F. Start checking for doneness at 45 minutes.

1. Unbaked yeast dough may be frozen. The best stage to freeze yeast dough is
before the final rising period. Mix and knead dough and let it rise the first
time. Punch down dough and shape into the desired shape and freeze. It may be
made into nonspecific shapes and shaped after it has thawed.

2. To thaw: If already shaped into final shape, thaw frozen dough in the cooking pan. Thaw at room temperature about 3 hours or in the refrigerator
overnight.

3. If not shaped into the final form, place in refrigerator to thaw 8 hours or
overnight. Let the dough then stand at room temperature about 15 minutes to
warm slightly before shaping.

Hand made bread = Active Dry Yeast (needs proofing)

Machine made bread = Instant Active Dry Yeast or Bread Machine Yeast

Quick made bread = Rapid Rise Yeast (requires a shorter cycle)

Adjust yeast according to the recipe and machine being used. The consistency of the dough and the amount of yeast will determine whether the loaf will be tall or short.

Mix all ingredients and store in tightly closed glass jar. Add to breadmaker in
amount equal to yeast with other dry ingredients. Start machine. Apparently,
the ginger gooses the yeast and makes it act more swiftly, the ascorbic acid
strengthens the gluten, and the lecithin aids the oil in causing the strands of
gluten to slip against each other more easily and thus rise better.

* Knead dough on floured surface and make into rolls. Place in 2 greased round cake pans. Let stand 1 hour. Bake about 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
I usually do the first few steps, ( to the * ) in my bread machine. This makes these rolls really easy to make. I also like this recipe because it makes two dozen rolls at a time.

  2                     Eggs -- Beaten
     1/2           Tsp  Baking Soda

I found this recipe on a package of semolina. The waffles are great, crisp and light. Next, I'm going to try substituting Malt-o-Meal.

Add ingredients in the order given, EXCEPT eggs and soda. Mix together and cover the bowl. Let stand at room temperature overnight or several hours. Add the eggs and soda before baking.
