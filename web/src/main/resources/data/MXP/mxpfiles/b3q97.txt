  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  fresh milk
  1                     egg yolk
  4          teaspoon.  margarine
     2/3           cup  mashed banana
  2          teaspoon.  sugar
  3               cups  bread flour
  1          teaspoon.  salt
  2          teaspoon.  yeast

I put these ingredients in the machine in this order and select medium-white.

If the banana is very ripe--which is why I use this recipe so often--then you need to cut down on the yeast somewhat or the bread rises all over the place!!! I've also substituted applesauce for the margarine and it's great. Let's see....also is great with chopped pecans or cinnamon or cloves added.....it's great!

Reggie--I plan to make a copy of everyone's favorite....what a great gift for a new breadmaker!

     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon

Line a 12-well muffin tin with paper baking cups. Preheat oven to 400F.

Measure flour, baking powder, salt and sugar into a big bowl.

Melt butter (about 45 seconds on High, uncovered, in a microwave). Add milk, then egg. Stir a little, just to break up the egg. Combine the wet and dry mixtures. Just stir gently with a fork. Stir in the blueberries.

Pour batter into muffin cups. Cover each with 2 tablespoons of topping. Bake 30 to 35 minutes.

When muffins are done, take the muffin tin out of the oven. The topping should be browned and crunchy and the tops mounded. Let muffins cool in the tin at least 5 minutes. Upturn the tin; the muffins will fall out. Makes 12 muffins.

Topping: Put butter, flour, sugar and cinnamon in a big bowl. Rub them between your fingers and palms until you've made crumbs about the size of peas. This may take 2 to 3 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4            cup  All-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  Salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda -- (heaped) <1>
  2 1/4            cup  Whole wheat flour
  2         tablespoon  Margarine -- <2>
  1 1/4            cup  Buttermilk -- <3>

Sift flour, salt, soda into bowl. Stir in whole wheat flour, blending. Rub in margarine lifting fingers high when mixing<4>. Add buttermilk all at once, using fork. Add more, if needed, to make soft dough<5>. Knead until smooth. Place on greased baking sheet; mark to deeply into four sections<6>.

Bake at 375 degrees for 40 minutes<7>. Allow to go cold on rack before cutting<8>. Serve with butter<9>.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Baking time: 40 minutes

1 - I use almost a double teaspoon
2 - In a startling reversal, I use butter. Just not much margarine around here.
3 - This space intentionally left blank
4 - This is easier than it sounds, especially if you melt the margarine
first. If it's still solid, I'm an advocate of the two-knife method.
5 - I always need much more, but it's easy to gradually dribble in extra, while pressing in the remaining flour until the whole ball coheres. Still, the dough I usually get is rather stiff and under-hydrated, and the bread has a close (but not dense), pressed consistency, almost like cheap particle board.
6 - those markings are important, and fun. Since there's no pre-baking rise, you don't have to be as ginger as you do with yeast doughs. Take any old knife you like and go nuts.
7 - This is a rough estimate. Start checking early for a firm bottom, an inner temperature of >200 F, and use the exposed innards from the oven spring as your own window into the internal progress.
8 - You do want it a bit cool, but there's no reason to delay too long. 10-20 minutes will do it.
9 - It's also good with jam, powdered sugar, or just by its own self. And I like it even better slightly stale, although I think I'm alone in that.

NOTES : I've had great success with the following quick bread, whose recipe is presented here as I cribbed it off the internet (with my annotations). There is a distinct, unmistakable soda taste, and a crumb unique among crumbs (see below). You can bake this as one hemispheric boule or two smaller ones, and with any mix-ins your heart desires. I've enjoyed it with caraway seeds (1 T.) and chopped black olives (1/2 cup, but it could have taken more if I were really determined). It meets all your criteria (as long as multi-grain means "more than one"). I suspect any number of ingredients could substitute for the dreaded margarine (which is really so minor I hesitate to pick on it) - prune puree would be consistent with the bread's flavor and appearance, but might be too heavy. Perhaps applesauce?

  1             recipe  banana bread
                        cranberries

I usually make banana bread (quick bread) and add cranberries to it. I usually use fresh or frozen berries, but last week I made it with dried fruit and it turned out good, but a little more dry than usual. (I also overcooked it a little bit by accident, so the dryness may have been from that more than anything.) I don't change the banana bread recipe at all because I think it is sweet enough without extra sugar and the cranberries add a nice tartness. If I am in the mood for a particularly sweet bread I will cook the cranberries first: Boil them in 1 cup water and ~1/2 cup sugar, then let cool to room temperature. Drain and add them to the banana bread batter. It is a really good dessert or breakfast sweet bread that way!

NOTES : Here is a easier method I just made with my cherry bread for breakfast this morning :-). I soaked the cherries (dried) in the sugar and hot water for 15 minutes to "plump". I then added to the recipe. The water was sufficient to cover the liquid and sugar content for the bread recipe. Counteracts any "drying" in the recipe. [FiberArt <fiberart@earthlink.net>]

Butter a loaf tin about 10 inches long and 4 to 5 inches wide and spread the dough in the tin. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 55 to 60 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. (The top will often crack; this is typical of soda and baking powder breads.) Let stand in the tin for a few minutes before turning out on a rack to cool. When thoroughly cooled, wrap in plastic or foil and let stand overnight or at least a day before cutting.

NOTES : In (belated) response to whomever was looking for a cranberry bread recipe, here is my favorite. It's a Thanksgiving staple at my house, it's GREAT for breakfast--and I recently had some fancy hors d'oeuvres that were little sandwiches with duck and cranberry relish on corn bread, and I think this bread (with duck or chicken or turkey) would give much the same effect. Enjoy!

This is a very liquid batter, which is poured into 3 - 4" rings.   If you
do not have muffin rings, use  low 7 oz cans (the kind tuna comes in) with
both the top and bottom lids removed.  This recipe will not work in a
Welbilt or Dak machine.

Add all ingredients for the dough in the order suggested by your bread
machine manual and process on the dough cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.

At the end of the dough cycle, pour the dough into a pitcher or bowl.
Grease 3 or 4 crumpet rings or low 3" cans with both ends removed, being
sure the top and bottom edges are greased, too.

Grease and heat a griddle or heavy frying pan large enough to hold the
tins.  Place the tins on the griddle or in the pan and pour or ladle 1/3 -
1/2 C of dough into eahc.  Cook over me heat until the tops bubble, about
10 min.  Remove the rings, turn the crumpets over, and brown on the other
side.  Repeat until you have used all of the dough.  Let cool, then split
and toast the crumpets.

NOTES : For Bobbi whose mother needs a bread baked with practically nothing, there is a bread made in the Outback of Australia. They put it in a large can, seal the can, and place it in a bed of hot coals. In about twenty minutes, the bread is risen, removed from the can and eaten. It is a little heavier than we are used to but it is wonderful - especially aroound a campfire.
Of course, it can also be made in an oven.

Serve in moderately thick slices while still fairly hot. Golden syrup) is the traditional thing to spread on it. It goes well with jam, too.

                              Drying Starter

                  ****

Have been reading the discussion of sourdough breads and starters and thought you might be interested to know that starter can be dried. You might not want to use the starter for awhile and "put it in limbo" until you want to use it again; you may need to move; you may have a valuable starter that you would hate to lose; or you may want to share your starter with someone who lives several hundred or thousand miles away. Sending dry starter is just like mailing a small package of flour, you can even do it in an envelope, as I have done. The only caveat is that it cannot be dried in very humid climates, and cannot be dried in a food dehydrator because the heat will kill the yeast. If you live in a borderline-humid climate you may be able to dry it in cold weather when your furnace lowers humidity - it would certainly be worth a try

DRYING SOURDOUGH STARTER

Use a cookie sheet with a lip. Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie sheet so in effect you have a "plastic pan". Pour 1/2 cup of starter evenly over plastic. It should be a thin layer. Place on top of refrigerator for 1-1/2 days. Peel pieces of dried starter off of plastic and turn over to continue drying other side 1/2 day. Be sure starter is thoroughly dry or it will mold or spoil.

When starter is dry put pieces in a blender or food processor and process until it looks like coarse flour. Store in an airtight container until needed.

RECONSTITUTING STARTER

Add one cup of water, 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp. sugar to dry starter in a plastic or glass container and follow directions for any starter use. It takes about 24 hours for starter to activate.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                cup  Buttermilk
     1/2           cup  Molasses
     1/4           cup  Butter or margarine
  2                 ts  Salt
  1           teaspoon  Fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  Caraway seed
  2         tablespoon  Dry yeast
     1/2           cup  Warm water
                        Grated rind of 1 orange
  1                cup  Rye flakes -- or wheat germ
  2                cup  Dark or light rye flour
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached flour -- (to 4 1/2 cups)
                        -- white or whole wheat flour
                        Glaze:
  1         tablespoon  Molasses
  2         tablespoon  Water

Similar to Swedish rye. Can be toasted.

Heat the buttermilk, molasses, butter or margarine, salt, fennel seeds, and caraway seeds until the butter melts. Set aside to cool.

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let it stand for 5 minutes until the yeast bubbles. ((My comment: whisk in some flour and molasses to nourish the yeast.)) Add the yeast to the cooled buttermilk mixture along with the grated orange rind, rye flakes or wheat germ, and rye flour. Beat well until smooth. Add 3 to 3 1/2 cups of wheat flour, stirring in a cup at a time, until the dough will not readily absorb more flour. The dough will be rough.

Flour a work surface with the remaining wheat flour and turn the dough out onto it. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15 minutes. (The gluten in rye is more fragile than in wheat. It needs a resting time to recuperate and reform and does not require as vigorous or lengthy a kneading).

Gently knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a large buttered bowl or pot, turning it to coat all sides with butter. Cover it and let it rise, in a warm spot, until doubled in size, about an hour.

Punch down the dough and gently knead it for one minute. Form the dough into three round loaves and place in lightly buttered 9-inch cake pans or on buttered baking sheets. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, 45 minutes to an hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the water and molasses, brush the tops with half of this mixture to glaze. Then lightly pierce the loaves all over with a fork.

Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. While the bread is hot, brush it with the remaining glaze. Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on racks.

Yields 3 loaves.

NOTES : This is my all-time favorite bread, I make it about once a week in the summer with fresh herbs and green garden onions. It keeps well, and sometimes I make 3 or 4 small loaves to give as gifts. I usually prepare in the machine on dough cycle, then bake in round loaves.

This is best when made in the summer, using fresh herbs. Be adventurous, use any combination of fresh herbs, about 2 tbs. of each. You can also add some parmesan cheese for a different flavor.

     1/4           cup  King Arthur Italian Bread Improver
  2           teaspoon  Fleischmann's Instant Yeast

Place ingredients in your breadmaker according to manufacturer's suggestions.
Select the dough cycle.
When finished, place the dough on lightly floured board. Punch down. Flatten out slightly, and with wet hands, pat water on the top of the dough.
Dry your hands, and roll the dough in a jelly roll fashion. Place the dough on a
floured peel, or directly onto a heavy, dark, baking sheet. Let rise 35-40 mins.
Preheat oven to 350. Bake at 350 for about 20 mins. I have a stone, so after 20 mins, I remove bread from the pan, and place it on the stone for about 5 mins, to crisp the bottom.

I've also used this recipe in the KitchenAid. It turned out pretty close to the same, but required more attention than the breadmaker.

NOTES : I have KA's Italian bread improver, and I love it. Since I began using it about 6 months ago, my Italian bread turns out much better. The inside is slightly denser, with a chewier texture, and the crust is not thick and tough anymore. It's thinner and has a good crunch/crisp to it. Oh yes, and it stays fresh a good two or three days longer!

  1 1/2            tsp  SAF yeast

When I transfer the bread to the finish pan the texture is springy, stretchy, soft but not sticky -- in other words perfect. The resulting bread rises just far enough that I can raise the bail without mashing or breaking the bread, and the texture is soft, fine, a bit chewy, and fully acceptable. The crust is a bit softer than I like, but that's another story -- basically, this is a good result.

  3 1/2           Cups  apple cider
  1         Tablespoon  apple cider
  2        Tablespoons  caraway seeds
  5 1/2           Cups  whole grain (coarse) rye flour -- or more
                        -- (i.e. Hodgson Mill)
  1                Cup  sourdough starter
                        -- (1:1 ratio water:bread flour)

  1                     egg
                        rye flakes

This recipe is for one of my all-time favorite breads, but it involves a two-day process and is a lot of work. This bread is a "sweet & sour" type of sourdough rye. It's a heavy but very hearty bread -- good with soups, meats & cheeses, cucumber & tomato slices, or just plain butter. It's a peasant bread which was originally mixed up in a special wooden container called an "abra," using a wooden spoon devoted solely to mixing this type of dough, and also lots of elbow grease for kneading. My father once said that the mixing and kneading were often delegated to children, I suppose to keep them busy. I've run across a few published recipes for this type of bread, but the recipes were very imprecise and my results were disastrous. I finally consulted a couple of very generous older Latvian women about their recipes. My result was to borrow ideas from both of them and then to adjust for modern technology using a Kitchen Aid mixer to do the nasty heavy stuff. The peasant version of this bread was baked in brick ovens, but my regular electric oven works quite well. I make this bread infrequently, but always in large batches (6 loaves at a time, using 3 Kitchen Aid bowls); the recipe below is for a single batch (2 loaves). The bread freezes well if well wrapped in plastic bags; frozen loaves of bread can be thawed and then warmed up in the oven before serving.
---
Heat 3 cups apple cider and 2 tablespoons caraway seeds to boiling; pour over 3 cups of coarse rye flour and stir. Let mixture cool. Add 1 cup active sourdough starter and mix well. The mixture will resemble heavy porridge as the rye flour absorbs the apple cider. Sprinkle 1/2 cup coarse rye flour over the mixture but do not stir at this point.

Cover your bowl with a dish towel, and then wrap the covered bowl with a beach towel or blanket. Put wrapped bowl in a warm spot (next to a heat register is good) and allow the mixture to ferment for up to 24 hours (less time if you think it will be too sour).

Dissolve 1 tablespoon yeast in 1/2 cup warm (105-115 degrees Farenheit) apple cider. Let the yeast mixture bubble and then add it to the sourdough mixture. Gradually add 1 teaspoon salt, 2-1/2 cups bread flour, and 2 cups coarse rye flour. Knead with your heavy-duty electric mixer. If the dough seems too wet, add more rye flour (wet dough will result in a soggy baked brick). This type of bread is tricky to make, as the dough is always very sticky from the rye; it takes some trial and error to get a feel for the dough. If the dough is too wet, it becomes slack after a while; the correct consistency of dough remains rather firm.

Spray a Formica countertop or a marble pastry board with vegetable cooking spray. Use a small plastic pan scraper or something like that to scrape your dough out of the bowl and onto your work surface. Using a bench knife/dough scraper, divide the dough into two equal chunks. Wet your hands with water and keep a bowl of water handy for additional dipping. Form the dough into two loaves on the oiled surface, using just your wet hands; do not add flour at this point. Place the loaves into oiled bread pans (8-1/2" x 4-1/2"). Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm place. Believe it or not, this very heavy dough WILL rise. OPTIONAL (not a traditional method): Brush on glaze made with 1 egg that's been mixed with 1 tablespoon of apple cider; sprinkle with rye flakes (obtainable from a food co-op).

Bake for 15 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit; then turn heat down to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and continue to bake for an additional hour. Don't underbake. Remove loaves from pans and allow to cool on a rack.

POSTSCRIPT: When measuring flour, I do not fluff and scoop into separate measuring cups; rather I just use my measuring cup to do the scooping and then level it off with a spatula. My resulting "cups" are probably somewhat on the dense side as a result of this.



                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Anyway, good luck and enjoy the bread. IT IS WORTH THE WORK!

  1               Tbsp  yeast
  2               Tbsp  extra virgin olive oil

                        -- Black Olive Pesto Dough:
  1                Cup  warm water
  3 3/4           Cups  all-purpose flour
  1               Tbsp  yeast
  2               Tbsp  extra virgin olive oil
     1/2           Cup  black olive pesto -- * See Note
  1                Tsp  salt
                        -- Olive Oil Dough:
  1 1/4           Cups  warm water
  4               Cups  all-purpose flour
  1               Tbsp  yeast
  1               Tbsp  butter
     1/4           Cup  extra virgin olive oil
  1                Tsp  salt

* The olive pestos are also called olivada (black) and oliverde (green), and I buy them at a local deli (brand name San Remo). Dean & Deluca also carries them, and I'm pretty sure they do mail order (over the Internet even, I believe). You can also make the pestos yourself; I have a recipe that says 2 cups of olives to 1/4 cup olive oil; 1 tsp thyme in the black pesto and 1/2 tsp black pepper in the green. (You can also throw in anchovies and capers if you want.) Process to a smooth paste.

Green Olive Pesto Dough
Pour the warm water into a bowl. Stir in 1 cup flour and the yeast. Let sit until the yeast has dissolved and the whole mixture has expanded. Stir in the olive oil, pesto, and salt. Add the balance of the flour gradually.
Knead three to four minutes, until the dough becomes cohesive. Give the dough a rest while you clean out and grease your bowl. When you return to the dough it will be more pliable and "together." Continue kneading until it is soft, smooth, and elastic. Put the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning it over to grease the top. Cover and set aside to double in bulk.

Black Olive Pesto Dough
Make this second dough just as you did the first but use black olive pesto
rather than the green.  Put aside to rise while you make the third dough.

Olive Oil Dough

Make as above, adding the butter, olive oil, and salt to the proofed water, flour, and yeast.

You may have to knock down the first two doughs and let them begin to rise a second time to give the third dough enough time for a complete rise. [Or, let the first two doughs rise in the refrigerator until the third dough is ready to begin its rise, then take the first two out to warm as the third dough rises.]

After all the doughs have doubled at least once, divide each into four equal sized pieces. Roll each into a rope about 15 inches long.

Take three strands of dough, one of each color [careful - the green and olive oil doughs look a lot alike!], and braid. Repeat with other strands until you have 4 loaves. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet with at least 3 inches between the loaves for expansion. Cover with a damp towel and let them rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Fifteen minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425F. Beat one egg white with 1 tsp water to make a wash, and brush over the tops of the loaves. Sprinkle braids with kosher salt.

Bake for 15 minutes at 425F. Turn the oven down to 375F and bake for a further 20 to 25 minutes. (If you're baking larger loaves, after 20 minutes at 375F, turn the heat down once more to 350F and bake a further 10 to 15 minutes.

The braids are done when they are golden brown and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. Cool on a rack. When they are thoroughly cool, seal any loaves you want to freeze in airtight plastic bags.

NOTES : I dug out my recipe for my family's favorite bread, and here it is.

The bread recipe comes from King Arthur's cookbook, and they in turn got it from Robin Voight, who runs a baking business in Connecticut called Kochen Coq, Inc. The recipe makes four good-sized loaves, or you can make three really big ones, or two really, really big...you get the idea. Enjoy!

                        -- 2 Loaves:
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  2                Tsp  Salt
  5                cup  All-Purpose Flour
  1                cup  Quick-Cooking Oats -- Uncooked
     1/2           cup  Light Molasses
  1               Tbsp  Butter Or Margarine -- Plus
  2                Tsp  Butter Or Margarine -- For Glazing
  2 1/4            cup  Water

Prep: 20 min plus rising and cooling
Bake: 40 min
Makes: 2 loaves, 12 servings each

In large bowl, combine yeast, salt and 2 C flour. In 2 qt saucepan, mix oats, molasses, 1 T margarine, and 2 1/4 C water. Heat over low heat until very warm (120-130F); margarine need not melt.

With mixer at low speed, gradually beat liquid into flour mixture just until blended. Increase speed to med; beat 2 min. Beat in 1/2 C flour to make a thick batter; beat 2 min longer, scraping bowl frequently with a rubber spatula. With wooden spoon, stir in remaining 2 1/2 C flour to make a stiff batter that leaves side of bowl.

Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap; let dough rise in warm place (80-85F) about 1 hr, until doubled. Grease two 2 qt round, shallow casseroles. With wooden spoon, stir down batter. Divide in half and turn into casseroles; with greased fingers, turn to grease tops and shape each into a ball. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let rise in warm place about 45 min, until doubled.
Preheat oven to 350F. Bake 40 min, or until loaves sound hollow when lightly tapped with fingers. Remove loaves from casseroles. If you like, for a soft crust, rub tops with remaining 2 tsp softened margarine cool on wire racks.

INFO: Batter breads are a quick way to enjoy yeast breads. Because they don't require kneading, the relatively soft, sticky batter usually calls for vigorous beating to develop the gluten, which gives the bread its structure and allows it to rise. Batter breads have a rustic appearance.

Although the texture won't be as fine-crumbed as bread that has been kneaded, the taste is still delicious.

Stir in enough additional flour to make a soft dough. On lightly floured surface, knead until smooth and elastic -- about 8 minutes. Dough will be slightly sticky.

Place in greased bowl - turning once. Cover with towel, let rise until doubled, about 50 minutes.

Punch down, knead on floured surface until no longer sticky, about 30 seconds. Divide dough in half and let rest, covered, 10 minutes.

Shape dough into 2 loaves and place in greased 9x5x3" loaf pans. Cover and let rise until double - about 35 minutes.

Bake in 375F oven 35 - 40 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Immediately remove from pans, brush tops with shortening, cool on racks.

                        -- or kosher salt/ pretzel salt

Stir the yeast into the water; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the milk and oil. Combine the rosemary, salt, and flour and add to the yeast mixture. Knead until velvety, elastic, and smooth8-10 minutes by hand. It should be somewhat moist and blistered.

Place the dough in a oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down dough, but do not knead. Cut in half and shape each half into a ball. Place each ball on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cover with a towel, and let rise 45 to 55 minutes (but not until truly doubled.

Heat the oven to 450F. Just before you put the loaves in the oven, slash the top of each in an asterisk with a razor blade and sprinkle half the sea salt into the cuts. [I use an egg white wash to act as glue for the salt.] Bake 10 minutes, spraying three times with water. Reduce the heat to 400F and bake 30 to 35 minutes longer. Cool on racks.

NOTES : I've been having trouble getting rye bread to rise in my West Bend (America's Best) bread machine. I have had consistently good results with white and whole wheat however. The rye actually rises well after mixing but fails to rise again after the first and second kneadings.

I've added dough enhancer and gluten without much effect.

I never had good luck with recipes using lots of whole-grain flour when I used a West Bend bread machine either. (I solved the problem by switching to a Zojiruchi.) Of the list of things you tried, I would say that increasing salt would be least likely to succeed, because salt inhibits the action of yeast.

Have you tried adding an acidifier to the recipe? I like to use 3 or 4 tablespoons of buttermilk powder in rye bread; it boosts the yeast and adds a tangy flavor. [bbriscoe@runestone.net (Bonnie Briscoe)]

     1/2            lb  Butter
  2         tablespoon  Honey
                        White sugar
                        Brown sugar

Mix yeast, brown sugar, dash of salt and 1 1/2 cups water. Let sit for five minutes. Add bread flour. Knead well. Let rise for about one hour. Grease baking sheet. Mix baking soda and warm water.

Take a piece of dough and roll and shape into a pretzel. The easiest way to shape is to roll into a rope, whatever size you prefer. Pinch ends of rope then bring ends of rope to other side of circle. Dip pretzels in warm water and baking soda mixture and put on baking sheet.

Bake at 425F for about 12 minutes. While still hot, brush with melted butter and honey. Sprinkle with white and brown sugar (approx. half and half mixture).

NOTES : This is supposed to taste  like Auntie Anne's (yummy).  The Auntie Anne's recipe calls for a baking  soda and water 'dip'.  Maybe that will help with dough made in the bread
machine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2       teaspoon  Yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  Salt
  2                cup  Bread flour
     1/2           cup  Egg substitute
     1/4           cup  Water
  1                     Egg white
  1         tablespoon  Water

Add yeast, salt, bread flour, egg substitute, and 1/2  cup water in the order suggested by the bread machine manufacturer and process on the dough cycle. Preheat  oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray baking sheet with  nonfat cooking spray. When the dough cycle is  complete, remove dough and place on lightly-floured surface. Roll dough into 12x4-inch rectangle and cut  into 8 (12-inch) strips. Pull each strip to about 14 inches in length. Form dough into pretzel shape: Make  a circle; cross the ends at the top, twist the ends  once and lay over the bottom of the circle. Pretzel  logs can also be shaped just by making rolled dough  into a 12- to 14-inch rope. Place pretzels on prepared  baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine egg white with  1 tablespoon water and brush on pretzels. If desired,  sprinkle pretzels with coarse salt, sesame, or poppy  seeds. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20 seconds. Serve with mustard or cheese dip.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  Dry yeast
  5                cup  Bread mix -- up to six
  1 1/2            cup  lukewarm water
  2                     Eggs -- beaten
                        -- TOPPING:

  2         tablespoon  Coarse salt
     1/2           cup  Butter -- melted

Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Blend in 2 eggs and butter. Add 5 cups bread mix. Stir well. Add additional bread mix to make a soft, but
not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth.

Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 to 24 inches long. Form into pretzel shapes. For pretzel sticks, cut dough into 5 to 6 inch lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets.

Preheat oven to 425. Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes, until brown and crisp. Makes 12 to  15 large pretzels.

Variation For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel-shaped dough into a pan of boiling water. When dough floats to the top of the water, remove it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake about 30 minutes.

                        white flour
                        water

The quick recipe is: mix up a thick soup of white flour and water and put it on your window sill for about a week, whipping it a few times a day to get air into it. Sourdough comes from wild yeast which are floating around in the air all the time... well, just when the weather's warm enough it. The flour and water is just a way of "harvesting" those yeasties.

After that several days, you should start to get bubbles forming and it should start to smell something like bread yeast. If it does, then it is. It's really pretty simple.

     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- pressed

makes 12

Sprinkle yeast and 1/4 tsp sugar over warm water in small bowl. Stir to dissolve. Let yeast mixture stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.


Combine remaining sugar, tomato juice, oil, eggs, and salt in a large bowl.
Add 1 cup of flour and whisk vigorously for 2 minutes. Add yeast mixture, basil, and tomatoes. Mix in enough flour 1/2 C at a time to form soft dough.
Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, add more flour if necessary, about 5 minutes (dough will be slightly sticky).


Grease large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl with plastic. Let dough rise in warm area until doubled, about 1 hour.


For garlic oil -- Heat oil in small sauce pan until just warm. Stir in garlic. Cool.


Lightly grease muffin cups. Gently punch dough down. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth. Divide into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, pulling edges under to create a smooth top. Place rolls, rounded side up in prepared cups. Using floured scissors, snip 1/2-inch-deep X into top of each roll. Cover with plastic and let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.


Preheat oven to 375 F. Gently brush rolls with garlic oil. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove rolls from oven, and brush again with garlic oil. Transfer rolls to a rack and cool slightly before serving.

I like to put a few shavings of Parmesan  on each roll a few minutes before the end of baking.

  2             pounds  Muenster Cheese -- grated
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted

Sprinkle yeast over the warm water, stirring with a fork until dissolved. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the milk, sugar, salt, and melted butter. Blend well and add the yeast mixture. Beat in 2 cups of flour until mixture is smooth. Add sufficient flour to make a soft, workable dough. Turn out on a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and satiny, about 8 minutes. Round into a ball and place in a warm, greased bowl, turning to coat the top. Allow to double in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and allow a second rising, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the filling. Spray a 10" cake pan with PAM. Punch the dough down, turn out on a floured board, cover, and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Roll into a large circle 24 to 26" in diameter. If dough resists, cover and let rest again. Fold circle of dough in half and lay across half of the cake pan. Unfold the dough. Carefully lift and press dough to fit into the pan leaving a skirt of dough draped over the rim. Mound the cheese on the dough forming it higher in the center. Pick up the skirt of dough and begin to pleat in loose folds around the mounded cheese, lifting and rotating the pan as you progress. Gather the ends on top together and twist into a knob. Take both hands and encircle the bottom of the knob and give a firm twist. If any dough is torn, pinch together firmly. Set loaf aside 15 minutes. Give the knob on more twist. Bake in a preheated 375F oven 1 hour, or until golden brown. If top becomes too brown, cover with foil the last 15 minutes. Let bread cool in cake tin on a wire rack. Do not attempt to slice until the cheese has congealed. Reheat if you wish to serve warm.This bread stems from middle Europe. It can be frozen, served warm, room temperature, or chilled. Do not substitute any other cheese

  1 3/4            cup  water

I usually add herbs to this (which I never measure, but about 2 tsp total is pretty flavorful), and top with seeds. I've also substituted or added whole wheat flour(up to 2 cups), wheat and/or oat bran, cheese, oil, dried garlic and onions, even spinach powder (which turned the bread green; I thought it looked gross, but everybody else liked it.)

My favorite herb combo is dried, minced garlic (or garlic powder), dill weed, and dill seed.

I use a mix of seeds for the top, usually sesame, poppy, flax, and caraway. These would look nice in a bow-tied cellophane bag!

  1                Tsp  Dill Weed
     1/2           Tsp  Dried Chives
     1/4           Tsp  Dried Oregano
     1/4           Tsp  Dried Thyme
     1/4           Tsp  Dried Basil

In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/2 C flour, yeast, sugar and salt. In a small saucepan, heat water and yogurt to 120 - 130F. Add to flour mixture; mix well. Add oil, herbs and enough of the remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 - 8 min. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hr. Punch dough down; shape into 2 loaves. Place in two greased 8 x 4 x 2" loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hr. Bake at 375F for 35 - 40 min or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
