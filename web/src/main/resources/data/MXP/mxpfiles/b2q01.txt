  1            package  Active Dry Yeast
  1                cup  Warm Water
  8               cups  Flour
  3                     Eggs -- Beaten
  4                     Egg Yolks -- Reserve Whites
  1                cup  Sugar
  2               cups  Milk -- Warmed
  1               Tbsp  Orange Zest
  1                cup  Butter -- Melted
  1                cup  Raisins

In a small mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water with a pinch of sugar. Let stand about 10 minutes until foamy.
In a very large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, 2 cups of the flour, the 3 whole eggs, 4 egg yolks, sugar, milk and orange zest; mix well.

Add the remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, until the dough comes together.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 5 minutes.

Flatten the dough out with your hands and dot 1/3 cup of the butter on the dough.

Fold up the dough and knead gently to incorporate the butter into the dough.

Repeat with another 1/3 cup and then with the last 1/3 cup of butter, until all of the butter is incorporated.

Again flatten the dough with your hands and sprinkle with the raisins. Fold up and knead to incorporate the raisins.

Lightly oil a large mixing bowl.

Place the dough in the bowl and turn the dough to lightly coat with oil.

Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let stand in a warm place until doubled in volume; about 1 hour.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into two equal size pieces. Form each piece into a loaf and place them in two lightly greased 9x5 in (23x12cm) loaf pans.

Again cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350F (180C).

Brush the tops of the loaves with egg whites (you will not use all 4 of the egg whites...just a nice brushing will do) and bake at 350F (180C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until the top of the loaves are golden and the loaves sound hollow when tapped.

"I came across a tip from a well known pastry chef. He said that if you want to get a high rise then freeze your butter and then grate it. I tried this with my biscuit recipe. I use mostly solid crisco shortening so I froze both the shortening and the butter and then grated them directly into the flour. With a spoon I turned the flour every minute or so so I would not be grating shortening on top of shortening and thereby creating a huge clump. It really did work well and the biscuits rose even more than they normally did."

                         Basic Whole Wheat Pasta

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips
                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg -- straight from
                        refrigerator
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
                        -- or any vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  water -- for my machine
                        -- original recipe says 1-2 T. water

I have had great success using my ABM to make pasta! I started with the instructions in Donna Rathmell German's book "The Pasta Machine Cookbook" which I definitely recommend. She gives suggestions for many combinations of flours and flavorful additions.

One of our favorites is the whole wheat version. I grind the wheat flour, sift to be sure there are not any "chunks" & then "dump" everything into the bread maker. Let it run for a minute or two to check that the consistency is right, then let it knead about ten minutes. Stop machine & wrap the ball of dough in plastic wrap for a few minutes to "mellow". Then I use an Atlas, crank type pasta roller to make the type of pasta that I want.The dough handles very well. It is simple, quick & easy! I rarely make pasta by any other method. My bread machine is an old Betty Crocker one that doesn't seem to have any problems with the pasta dough.

The oil can be omitted for a lower fat pasta, also you can use only egg whites. Omit the salt if you like. You can use 1/4 c. oat flour, and 3/4 c. all purpose flour for a very tasty pasta also. Almost any combination works well for me.

NOTES : I made the recipe for whole wheat pasta in the bread machine and it came out excellent. I needed to add more water than specified - about 3 tbs. but then, it was a very dry day! The consistency was that of clay - not soft like bread dough. Rolled it through my hand-cranked pasta machine, let it dry 10-15 minutes, then cut the noodles on the pasta machine and hung them on my rack to dry. Cooked them for about 5-6 minutes and they were far better than what I've previously purchased in the grocery store (and far less expensive!). Rather than grind my own wheat - I'll try that next time - I used King Arthur's white whole wheat. This made enough fettucini-like pasta for 2-3 people. [Bruce J Edwards <bruce54@juno.com>]

                      Bleached And Unbleached Flours

This article is excerpted from one entitled: "Oil Slick" but I am only sending that portion of the article in which a question is asked about the differences between bleached and unbleached flour.

Thought you people might be interested in the perspective of this chemist, Robert L. Wolke

"Oil Slick" (washingtonpost.com) By Robert L. Wolke, Wednesday, May 30, 2001; Page F01


QUESTION: How does bleached flour differ from unbleached flour? Unbleached wheat flour looks pretty white to me, so why do flour manufacturers bother with the bleaching step? Does the bleaching process leave any unsavory residues or leach out any nutrients?

ANSWER Wheat flour is naturally yellowish, but people apparently don't like yellow flour, except for the semolina used in pasta-making, which isn't usually bleached. Yellow bread and snow-white pasta wouldn't sell very well. If given half a chance, though, flour bleaches itself. That is, as it ages in air, the yellow color is oxidized away. But that takes time and time is money, so manufacturers speed up the process by using an oxidizing or bleaching agent such as potassium bromate (in which case the flour is said to be brominated), chlorine dioxide or benzoyl peroxide. These bleaching agents aren't mere cosmetics. Flour that has been "aged," either naturally or by being treated with oxidizers, makes doughs that handle better and produce better bread.

Unbleached flour generally costs more than bleached flour because it has been whitened by natural aging, which entails the costs of storage.

Some people are concerned with the intimidating natures of these chemicals. But they are all unstable and, after doing their jobs, do not remain in the flour. The bromate, after reacting with the yellow compounds in the flour, is converted into harmless bromide. Chlorine dioxide is a gas that dissipates, so there is none of that left in the flour either. Any excess of benzoyl peroxide would decompose as soon as the flour is heated. The claim that bleaching flour destroys its Vitamin E is true but empty, because wheat flour contains negligible amounts of Vitamin E to begin with.

                        *****

Rich, Shiny Glaze
-----------------
Brush undiluted evaporated milk twice on the bread, first before it is
placed in the oven (or halfways through the baking) and again about 5
minutes before it is removed from the oven.  It will finish to a nice
russet color.


Egg Glaze
---------
Beat 1 egg yolk with 1 teaspoon of milk and brush on the bread just as
indicated with the Rich, Shiny Glaze (above). This brown will be a bit more
yellowish in color.


Glaze for French or Italian loaves
----------------------------------
Cook together:
1-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 c. water

Cool before applying


Leopard or Tiger Crust
----------------------
This should be made about 10 minutes prior to putting the loaves in the oven.

Stir together:
1/2 t. dry yeast
1 t. sugar
2 T. warm water

When it foams, stir in:
2 T. cornstarch or arrowroot
1 t. oil

Stir this mixture well and brush thickly over the loaf when it is ready to
be placed in the oven.


Sweet Finish
------------
Combine:
1 c. confectioner's sugar
2 T. liquid (may be water, milk, white wine, or fruit juice)
few drops of flavoring as desired

Pour this mixture over the bread when it has partially cooled after being
removed from the oven.

NOTE: white wine makes the clearest glaze

                 Bread Tips, Hints And Substitutions Tips

Recipe By     :

                        *****

1. Using milk in place of water will produce a softer crust.

2. Olive Oil will prevent the bread from drying out too quickly.

3. You can cut back on the salt and sugar but do not omit them.

4. Do not use Lite or tub margarine if first ingredient is water. Bread will over rise.

5. Be sure to spoon the flour and not dip the measuring cup into the flour. Fill the cup over the top and then level off with a straight edge.

6. Vital Gluten is the dried protein taken from the flour by getting rid of the starch. It is a good dough conditioner or enhancement for yeast breads especially for whole grain breads or when using all-purpose flour.

7. If making 100% whole wheat bread, use 1 1/2 teaspoons Vital Wheat Gluten per cup of flour.

8. Lite salt can be used if it has both potassium chloride and sodium.

9. One 1/4-ounce packet of yeast equals 2 1/4 teaspoons.

Hints

10. During the winter or drier months, the amount of water may need to be increased.

11. During the warmer or more humid months, the amount of water may need to be reduced.

12. Before measuring molasses or honey, oil the measuring spoon to help it run better.

13. Using water that potatoes have been cooked in produces a higher loaf of bread.

14. If using fresh fruit in a bagel or bread recipe, reduce the amount of liquid used. Any fresh fruit will add extra liquid.

15. If bread is falling or is wrinkling on top, too much liquid was used. If bread did not rise, it could be a number of causes: forgot yeast or yeast was expired or stored wrong; forgot to put in the kneading blade; or the salt was omitted.

16. Fruit juices, beer and purees can be used in place of liquids in a recipe.

17. Measure the liquid ingredients in a glass measuring cup.

18. Let the bread cool at least 30 minutes before slicing, and completely (an hour?) before putting it in a storage bag or container.

19. Breads made with oatmeal tend to stay fresh longer.

20. Oat Bran can be substituted for up to 1/4 cup of oatmeal in a recipe.

21. For a bit of crunch add 1/2 Tbs Untoasted Wheat Germ per cup of bread flour.

22. Quick Cook Oats or Old Fashioned Oats work best in a bread machine.

23. Too much garlic in a recipe causes bread not to rise. Add garlic to liquid, avoid yeast.

24. Too much cinnamon causes bread not to rise. Use only 1/2 tsp per cup of bread flour.

25. Have all ingredients (milk, juice, butter, etc.) at room temperature before adding to pan improves rising.

26. Refrigerated or frozen dry ingredients should be brought to room temperature before using.

27. Measure accurately - too little or too much yeast can ruin breadmaking. Too little causes a heavy, dense loaf; too much produces a porous texture and excessive yeast flavor.

28. Recipes to which you increase sugar (or other sweeteners), or add fruits or nuts -- often require more yeast.

29. Dense, low-gluten dough like those made with rye flour rise better/faster by slightly increasing yeast.

30. A dough with too much flour or lacking enough gluten results in bread that it is dry and dense.

31. Baking bread at lower temperatures (325 to 350 F) creates thicker, chewier crusts, whereas baking bread at higher temperatures (375 to 425 F) produces a thinner, crispier crust.

32. Correct liquid temperature is a critical variable for proofing bread. Measure temperatures of all liquids; adjust to 85 F for normal and rapid cycles, and to 125 F for a FAST 1-hour cycle.

Substitutions

1. One cup buttermilk = one cup milk plus one Tbs vinegar or lemon juice

2. One cup low-fat or no-fat yogurt = one cup of buttermilk

3. One teaspoon baking powder = 1/4 tsp baking soda plus 1/2 tsp cream of tartar

4. One Tbs butter or margarine = one Tbs unsweetened applesauce

5. One Tbs dry herbs = three Tbs fresh herbs

6. One whole egg = 1/4 cup or two egg whites

7. Egg substitutes = follow package instructions

8. One Tbs dry milk = one Tbs dry buttermilk

9. If a Delayed cycle START is desired, use dry milk, and non egg solid products such as Ener-G egg Replacer

The different finishes give a different look or taste to bread. Warm butter makes the bread very soft, and I like that for dinner rolls.

you can use the rest of the egg in an omelette, but that grosses me out.

i have convinced the teenage step daughter to use the rest of the egg as a beauty mask. She swears it gets rid of zits and she stopped buying the prescription filled with vitamin A (egg yolk has a lot of that)

a whole-egg wash is the best way to stop sweet loafs, like Portuguese sweet bread, from having a thick, hard crust. A shiny, thin crust is well worth the price of one egg.

  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda

  1              large  egg
  2                     egg whites

Here's a classic recipe that has been updated with the use of flax, whole-wheat flour and egg whites. It's a great way to slowly start to incorporate flaxseed into your diet.


Preheat oven to 425 F. Coat muffin cups with canola cooking spray or use paper muffin cups to line pan.

Combine flax, flours, sugar, baking soda and salt in large mixing bowl. Stir to mix well. Add cereal and stir again.

Combine buttermilk, oil, maple syrup and eggs in medium bowl and blend well with fork or whisk. Pour into dry ingredients and beat just until blended.

Spoon 1/4 cup batter into each muffin cup and bake until toothpick inserted in to center of muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove from baking pan and cool muffins on wire rack. Serve warm, if desired. Batter can be prepared before baking and stored in airtight container in refrigerator. Bake as many muffins as desired and keep remaining batter for up to a week and bake as needed. Makes about 24 muffins.

Here is a simple and effective way to clean a coffee/spice/seed grinder between batches of different items. It may sound like it is too easy, but it really works. I use my grinder to make citrus peel "zest" and this removes the citrus oil, will remove coffee oils so you will not have crossover flavors.

In your grinder place 2 or 3 tablespoons of plain old baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) add 2 or 3 saltine crackers broken in pieces. (depending on the size of the grinder) I have the large and use 4 saltines.

replace the lid and whiz the stuff around for 15 seconds or so, shaking the grinder so all parts get exposed to the material.

Dump the stuff out and wipe with a dry paper towel. To test, drop in a couple of pieces of stale bread, whiz for a couple of seconds and taste.

If you have an old grinder with a build up of "gunk", substitute 2 tablespoons of white rice for the crackers. whiz the rice and baking soda around for 15 seconds, check, and if it is still gunky, run it for another 10 to 15 seconds. This will really clean the grinder but if you do this too often the rice will dull the blades.

Bread Revolution
Bay Area bakers changed how we think about our daily bread

Learn Your Loaves

Here are brief definitions of some of the most common artisan breads produced by Bay Area bakeries.

Baguette. Long, narrow yeasted French bread loaf with a crisp crust and slightly chewy interior punctuated by many air holes. Made in sourdough and sweet versions (sweet - as in not sour), sometimes studded with a mixture of seeds; it's best eaten the day it's baked.

Batarde. Similar to a baguette but with a larger circumference and lower percentage of crust vs. interior.

Brioche. (Not pictured.) A light-textured yeasted French bread rich in eggs and milk with a soft crust, traditionally made in individual loaves roughly the size of muffins, with a fluted base and topknot ball of dough. It can also be made in large loaves generally weighing 12 to 16 ounces. Brioche dough is often used to encase savory fillings.

Challah. Traditional yeasted Jewish egg bread similar in texture to brioche. The classic challah is braided, glazed with egg white and often sprinkled with sesame or poppy seeds.

Ciabatta. A wide, rather flat yeasted Italian loaf so named because its shape supposedly resembles a slipper (ciabatta in Italian). It has a thin crust, dusted with flour, and an airy crumb.

Focaccia. A relative of pizza, this flat Italian yeast bread usually incorporates olive oil, with more oil drizzled over its dimpled top. The bread is often topped with rosemary or other herbs, or sun-dried tomatoes. Focaccia has become a favorite for Mediterranean-style sandwiches.

Levain. Made with natural fermentation, utilizing wild rather then commercial yeasts, pain au levain (its full name) comes in round or oval loaves with a rustic character - large, uneven holes and assertive grain flavor, partly due to small amounts of whole wheat or rye flours.

Pain de mie. Virtually identical to a Pullman loaf, this yeasted bread often contains a small amount of sugar, butter and milk. It is baked in lidded pans, which result in perfectly square loaves with a dense crumb that can be sliced very thinly for dainty sandwiches or Melba toast.

Panini. A sandwich roll of Italian-style yeasted bread. Panino means sandwich.

Pugliese. Often incorporating olive oil, this rustic Italian loaf is similar to ciabatta, with large holes and good grain flavor.

                        *****

Bread was my single biggest disappointment when I first set foot in the United States some 50 years ago. Post-World War II Europeans saw America as the land of milk and honey. Well, there was nothing wrong with the milk and the honey, but the bread was another story.

In my Midwestern college days, the choice was between white and so-called whole wheat (almost indistinguishable from white except for a less appetizing muddy color).

Things improved when I eventually ended up in San Francisco. Here, at least, there was the alternative of sourdough French bread - crusty, chewable and with flavor and an aroma that said "bread" rather than "industrial byproduct."

There wasn't much in the way of sandwich bread, though, except for the occasional neighborhood bakery that turned out an acceptable if undistinguished Pullman loaf.

Then came the '70s: antiwar protests, Flower Power, Earth consciousness, food conspiracies and a turning away from anything produced by corporate America. A lot of people - especially those who had not yet reached the despicable age of 30 - started baking their own bread, with whole grains, molasses, honey and home-brewed starters. Most of it was awful.

But those trial efforts paved the way. In the 1980s, it suddenly seemed like some wild yeast had descended on the Bay Area, giving rise to a bread revolution. Almost overnight, a bevy of bakers started crafting European-style loaves, and wonderful bread became an alternative to Wonderbread.

Suddenly, the buzz among restaurant goers and discriminating shoppers was all about bread. Baguette, until then a rather rarefied term, became as commonplace as doughnut. Batarde, panini, ciabatta, pain de mie, focaccia, brioche and pugliese established themselves in our bread baskets.

There may be as many reasons quoted for this sea change in baking as there are practitioners of the craft (65 microbakeries in the Bay Area alone, according to industry sources, and that doesn't include in-store bakeries at such markets as Whole Foods and Andronico's).

Steve Sullivan, co-founder of high-profile Acme Bread Co. in Berkeley, believes that consumers will always choose the best from what they are offered.

In the dark ages of American bread, the mid-20th century, when mass-produced, packaged bread ruled the roost, Americans used bread for sopping up gravy and as a wrapper for equally mass-produced lunch meats, he says. The bread readily available was adequate for those purposes.

With Californians in unprecedented numbers having traveled to Europe, where they feasted on traditional breads, the time was ripe for giving them similar choices on their home turf.

Sullivan, who started as a bus boy at Chez Panisse in 1973, the same year he enrolled at UC Berkeley, eventually became the restaurant's baker and, in 1983, cofounded Acme, specializing in crisp-crusted baguettes and other European-style breads.

His baking confrere, Glenn Mitchell, and Mitchell's wife, Cynthia, started Grace Baking Co. at Market Hall in Oakland's Rockridge district in 1987, right after the Wall Street Journal wrote that smart money would open a bakery now. The couple proved the venerable financial sheet correct. Grace, now operating from a huge state-of-the-art, highly mechanized facility in Richmond, has become the Bay Area market leader in terms of production and range of distribution. Alone among local artisanal bakeries, Grace has expanded to stores as far away as Alaska and Montana. To give far-flung customers freshly baked bread, Grace employs a prebake method in which not-quite-finished bread is pulled from the oven, frozen, shipped and then "baked off" at the point of sale.

Mitchell insists that nothing is lost in the process. The breads are slow- risen - one of the techniques essential for the development of artisan breads' texture and flavor - and the initial baking actually produces an edible, if rather pale, loaf. In adopting this nontraditional technique, Grace is following another industry leader, Los Angeles' La Brea Bakery. That outfit's prebaked baguettes, available at Whole Foods markets here, actually won first place against local competition in a Chronicle Food section Taster's Choice test a few years ago.

Other bakers, without criticizing Grace, won't go this route, preferring methods that hark back to hundreds of years of European and colonial American baking practices. Many of them let round loaves rise in baskets, as is traditional in France. One of the few nods to modern technology is a certain amount of climate control. Starters are often kept in refrigerators, and measures are taken to counteract huge swings in temperature and humidity, which can wreak havoc on yeast doughs, with dry air the worst enemy.

"Every night at 3 a.m. we check the National Weather Service," says Mike Rose of Semifreddi's. Adjustments are made to pamper the dough which, as Rose points out, is a living thing until it's slid into the oven.

Semifreddi's is a family affair. Tom Frainier, a refugee from the corporate world, owns the company, with his sister Barbara and her husband, Michael Rose.

Together the threesome has taken the bakery from its 1984 beginnings in a barely 500-square-foot storefront in Kensington to its current nearly 20,000- square-foot plant in Emeryville.

Except for size, little has changed. "We have no investors," says Frainier, "so we can do things on our terms." Those terms embrace old-fashioned, largely manual production methods and a business philosophy that includes profit sharing and cash bonuses for employees.

The owners take a purist approach to bread making, using just flour, water, yeast and salt, except in a few special items like challah.

"We don't put things like cheese in our bread," says Frainier, in keeping with his opinion that bread should complement food, not be the whole show. Frainier and Rose credit pioneers in other food-related enterprises with reawakening consumers' appreciation of all sorts of honest, real food, including bread - people like Robert Mondavi (wine), Alfred Peet (coffee) and Fritz Maytag (beer).

When pressed, they will name Acme as their closest competitor (the companies both operate in the $7 million to $8 million annual range), but it's a respectful and friendly competition, they say.

The mutual respect among these bakers is particularly noteworthy since this is what Semifreddi's Rose calls the most competitive food area in the world. Then again, there are many connections among these bakers. Semifreddi's was founded in 1983 by Eric and Carol Sartenaer (now owners of Phoenix Pastificio pasta shop and cafe in Berkeley). They had worked at Berkeley's Cheese Board collective, one of the pioneers of the artisan bread movement. The Sartenaers sold Semifreddi's in 1987 to two employees, one of whom was Barbara Frainier Rose.

Grace Baking was the proving ground for the Ponsford siblings, Craig and Elizabeth, who went on to open Sonoma's acclaimed Artisan Bakers in '92.

The Ponsfords have a strong French orientation, bringing in consulting bakers from France every so often. (In a nice twist, Craig and his breads won the World Cup of Baking competition in Paris in 1996 and he coached the gold medal-winning U.S. team in '99.)

Elizabeth Ponsford finds no surprise in the fact that artisan breads thrive in Northern California. Californians, she says, are the most educated in the country when it comes to eating. "They are used to the highest quality food across the board."

Which means that they think locally baked fresh batarde, pugliese, baguettes and ciabatta are the greatest thing, well, since sliced bread.

                             Flax Seed: About

                        *****

Ancient records show that flaxseed has been consumed by humans since the beginning of civilization. Before 5000 B.C., Egyptians carried flaxseed in their medical bags. A little later in history, Hippocrates wrote about using flax for the relief of abdominal pains.

In the eighth century, King Charlemagne thought flax so important for the health of his subjects, that he passed laws requiring its consumption. Over more recent centuries, the growing of flaxseed has spread across Europe, Africa and now to North America.

Yet, with all this glorious history, flaxseed is still a mysterious health food ingredient to most of us. Along with soy, it is just starting to gain recognition in the world of nutrition.

Flaxseed is believed to improve cardiovascular health and digestion, inhibit tumor formation, decrease the symptoms of menopause, increase stamina, reduce the inflammation of arthritis and even produce silky smooth skin and shiny hair. And that's just for starters.

Nutty and buttery in flavor, flaxseed contains a virtual powerhouse of nutrients. It's one of the richest sources of alpha-linolenic acid, one type of fatty acid in the omega-3 family, considered a superunsaturated fat or a "good fat."

Omega-3 fatty acids, also found in salmon, leafy vegetables and nuts, help reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering elevated blood fat (serum triglycerides) and reducing blood pressure. Flaxseed is also an excellent source of insoluble and soluble fiber, which helps reduce cholesterol levels.

In addition to the omega-3 fatty acids and added fiber, flaxseeds contain a phytoestrogen, a naturally occurring plant estrogen, called lignans. Lignans are touted as having many health-related benefits including prevention of bone loss, reduced risk of colon cancer and estrogen-related breast cancer, and diminished symptoms of menopause. Both flaxseeds and soybeans are two of the richest food sources for plant estrogens.

Besides flaxseeds, flax oil is readily available in health food stores. Both the seeds and oil have benefits, but many prefer to use the seeds for their additional high fiber and lignan content.

Flax seeds are found in health food stores, where it is often available in bulk, or in the natural foods sections of larger grocery stores. There are many varieties of flaxseed, but the most common are reddish-brown in color and slightly larger than sesame seeds in size. Flaxseed can be purchased whole, milled (ground) or as an ingredient in a variety of baked goods.

Natural Ovens of Manitowoc blazed trails by using flaxseed in its long list of bread products. Paul Stitt, chairman of the board for Natural Ovens, is endearingly called the "father of flax" by his fellow biochemists and his wife and partner, Barbara Stitt, president of Natural Ovens.

"Twenty-five years ago, I was looking for an omega-3 source and I turned to flax as the target of my research," shares Paul Stitt. "Flaxseed is one of the oldest seeds known to man. It has been used for 8,000 years of history as a source for sustaining energy."

Today, the Stitts share a passion for this little seed. They have made it easy for their customers to get their daily dose of omega-3 by eating Natural Ovens breads, rolls, granola, cookies, bagels, muffins and pancake and waffle mix. They also recommend mixing their dietary supplement, Ultra Omega Balance, into one's morning OJ.

Other companies have begun to jump on the bandwagon with flax products. A tour through your health food store will turn up many sources of ready-to-eat foods containing flaxseed. One of the newest products is a flax- and soy-based granola by Zoe Foods, called Flax and Soy Clusters.

Zoe Foods was established by Tori Stuart, after her mom discovered a natural solution for managing her menopausal discomfort. "She began making her own granola from flaxseed, soy and other natural ingredients believed to help manage menopause," shares Stuart, president of Zoe Foods. "She found that eating her granola daily diminished the frequency and intensity of her hot flashes. From my mom's personal experience came the idea for Zoe Foods."

Zoe Foods is soon to expand its product line by adding two flax and soy bars, chocolate and apple crisp, for flax and soy on the go. Clif Crunch Bars and Luna Bars are another convenient source for flax in a portable, hand-held bar that contains high fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids.

But what if you want to add flaxseed to your own recipes?

The nutty and pleasant taste of flaxseed is very easy and far less intimidating to work with than other health foods, such as soybean products. The only rule to remember is to grind the flax seeds before using them. Flax seeds need to be milled for their benefits to be absorbed by the body.

The seeds can be milled or ground in a blender, food processor or a coffee grinder. Salton manufactures the Daily Dose Flax Seed Mill (Model #FX5, $29). It stores four ounces of whole flaxseed ready for milling and has an adjustment that allows the user to vary the grind from course to fine. If you are a frequent user of flaxseed, this is a dedicated and convenient way to process and enjoy it in its freshest form.

Take it easy

It is recommended to ease flax into your diet a little at a time. Because flax is very high in fiber (30g fiber for every 100g of dry seed), your body needs to adjust slowly. Start with a half of a tablespoon per serving and slowly increase. **

It is also important, according to Paul Stitt, to add zinc and vitamin B-6 to your diet along with flaxseed in order for the body to absorb its many benefits. Natural Ovens products are fortified with both, so the work is done for you. Check other products to see whether they are fortified, or make sure your daily vitamin supplement includes both.

Once you've ground your flaxseed, the meal is easy to add to your favorite recipes. Add it to any number of recipe categories including baked goods, smoothies, casseroles, burgers and meatloaf.

Recommended daily levels vary depending on which expert you consult. Moderation is certainly in order until more research has been done. Andrew Weil, physician and author of "Spontaneous Healing," for example, recommends consuming two tablespoons of ground flax daily to benefit the cardiovascular system.

If you are taking medications, the Flax Council of Canada suggests you eat flax or flax products only with the specific approval of your physician.

I have added flax seed meal to virtually every loaf of bread I have made for several years. I think that I started because I read an article that stated that the meal is associated with lowering cholesterol levels. Flax seed is nutritious and adds good fiber to your diet. The seeds also have a laxative effect for some people, so it's a good idea to start out with a small amount per loaf if anyone in your family has a sensitive or an irritable bowel. I use 1/2 cup per two pound loaf of any kind of bread. I don't change the amount of any flours, and I have had no problems. [Ellen Lee <leep@mkl.com>]

---
You should use your coffee grinder to make the flax meal. Flax meal must be kept refrigerated and used fairly quickly, so the coffee grinder is precisely what you need to use. My "signature" bread is a 100% whole wheat that also contains 2-3 tbs whole flax seed, which I grind into meal for each loaf. Whole flax seeds have a very tough outer shell and, supposedly, can pass through our digestive system intact if not ground into meal. [Harry Glass <hglass@yahoo.com>]

              Focaccia: Basic Dough For Flatbreads Or Loaves

Recipe By     :Suzanne Dunaway,  No Need to Knead

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                Hand Made                       Italian


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  lukewarm water
                        -- (85 to 95F)
  2               tsp.  active dry yeast
  4               cups  unbleached bread flour
                        -- (I use KA's ap flour)
  2               tsp.  salt -- (2 to 3)
  2               tsp.  olive oil -- (2 to 3)
                        -- (I don't use)
  2                  T  chopped fresh rosemary -- (optional)
                        Kosher or sea salt

To those people interested in my recipe for wet doughs:
Here is the recipe, gleaned from Suzanne Dunaway's No Need to Knead, a highly recommended book.

Measure the water into a large bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir until dissolved. Stir in 2 cups of the flour and the salt and stir briskly (with wooden spoon) until smooth, about 2 minutes. With a wooden spoon, stir in the remaining 2 cups of flour (plus or minus, depending on type of flour you are using) for about two minutes longer, just until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and the flour is incorporated. The dough will be fairly wet and tacky (sticky), but when it pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a loose ball, you'll know the dough has been stirred sufficiently. If it seems too sticky, stir in an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour. (You will get to know how the dough should look from experience.......you will get good results, even with variations.)

Same day method: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 30 to 40 minutes. Proceed with the shaping instructions.

Overnight method (what I do): Cover the bowl (after dropping in a little oil and turning the dough with the scraper noted in my March 04 instructions) and refrigerate overnight. The dough will rise in the refrig and acquire flavor from the slower yeast action. Remove the dough 2 hours before shaping and let stand, covered in a warm place. The dough will rise for the second time. Proceed with the shaping instructions. (Comment: I have found from creating many a loaf that all doughs, sweets included, benefit from the refrig rise - they are far more cooperative for shaping. I keep in refrig sometimes for two days, but beyond that, the dough needs a bit more flour added to keep the yeast feeding on it.)

Suzanne has many shaping methods, but I will only go into what I do:

Remove dough from refrig. Leave out on counter for a couple of hours (more or less, not fussy). Then with the kidney-shaped flexible plastic scraper (noted in March 04 digest), hold bowl up, tilt sideways and scrape dough out onto a piece of parchment on a half-sheet baking sheet. It flows out like lava, ending up in a large spready oval. I then leave it out for a while until it seems ready (varies, short time to hours - it is forgiving - on the counter at room temperature); then dimple it with a floured finger, then sprinkled with a little olive, spread out with my fingers or a brush, then salted, then sprinkled with herbes de provence or oregano, or rosemary, or whatever you choose, then into a 500F oven, turned down to 450F as soon as you put it in). I put the half-sheet right on a baking stone on the bottom shelf of my gas-oven, bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven when light to medium browned - pick up with edges of parchment and plop down (still with parchment) on a rack to cool. It is tempting to try to cut while warm, but letting it cool completely is far better.

I mostly use a sourdough starter, about a cup stirred into the 2 cups of lukewarm water after yeast has dissolved, but it is not necessary, just gives a different flavor, more complex. But I don't want to get into the starter method - this is a note for those who have a starter in their lives.

  1                  t  Salt
  2                  t  Active dry yeast

This is a wonderful recipe I came across posted at Culinary.com. I have made these many times; preparing the dough in my bread machine then shaping into two baguettes. They truly are the best french breads I have ever made...the closest to a true french...and they LOOK smashing!

French Bread Extraordinaire
And it really is.

1. Place dough ingredients in bread pan, select DOUGH setting and press start.

2. When dough cycle ends the machine will beep. Set a timer and allow the dough to rise I more hour. Open the machine, punch down the dough, set the timer again and let dough rise another hour in the machine. Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turnout dough onto a lightly floured countertop or cutting board. Form into a smooth, round ball then flatten it with your hands.

3. Place a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) in a round wicker basket that's at least twice the size of the dough. Dust the towel liberally with flour. Place the round dough in the center of the basket. Place basket in a warmer place and let dough rise, uncovered, about 45 minutes until double in size.

4. Gently turn dough out of basket upside down onto a greased baking sheet. With a knife held almost parallel to the loaf, carefully slash the top of the dough at a sharp angles in a # pattern.

5. Preheat oven to 450 F. Place a small pan on the floor or bottom shelf of the oven and carefully add at least 1 C. boiling water to the pan. Place dough in oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and place on cake rack to cool 1 hour before slicing. To preserve the crisp crust, do not store in plastic wrap or bag. Bread can be loosely covered or left out for up to two days before it dries out completely. Note: Panasonic users: do not use the Crisp Dough cycle This method though time-consuming, produces an exceptional loaf of French bread much like the ones baked in the boulangeries of Paris. The extra risings fully develop the bread's flavor. The finished loaf will have a crisp crust and very moist, chewy interior.

My notes: Sometimes I substitute 1/4 C. Whole Wheat flour for 1/4 C. of the unbleached flour. Likewise, with Rye Flour. Sometimes I take out 1/2 C. unbleached and add both WW and Rye (1/4 C. each)... My normal method of baking the loaf is in a Clay Cooker, but its only because I really like the crust that the soaked Clay Cooker gives any French loaf. Sometimes I add a couple of tablespoons of sesame seeds to the dough as it is kneading (for flavor). Sometimes I use an egg wash, then seeds of some sort before I bake it. I also add 1 T. Gluten to the ingredients, but I am a gluten person!!! Lots you can do with this simple loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               Tbsp  Olive Oil
  2                     Onion
  1 1/4           cups  Warm Water
     1/4            Oz  Active Dry Yeast
  1               Tbsp  Granulated Sugar
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt
  4               cups  All-Purpose Flour
  1                 Lg  Egg

The breadsticks on the table at your favorite Italian restaurant are called grissini. You can buy packaged grissini at Italian specialty shops, but they are far better when homemade. These are onion-flavored.

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, until deep golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.

2. Put warm water in a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top and let stand for 5 minutes. Add sugar and salt. Gradually stir in three-fourths of the flour and stir until the mixture forms a dough. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary, until the dough is soft, silky and no longer sticky. (Alternatively, to make dough in a food processor, dissolve yeast in warm water. Combine 3 cups flour, sugar and salt in the food processor. With the motor running, gradually pour the yeast mixture through the feed tube. Add additional flour as necessary to make a dough that forms a ball, then process for 40 to 60 seconds to knead. Turn out onto a floured work surface.)

3. Knead in the reserved onions, adding additional flour as needed. Place the dough into a lightly oiled medium-sized bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour

4. Set oven racks in upper and middle positions; preheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil 2 baking sheets or spray with nonstick cooking spray and dust with flour.

5. Punch down the dough and turn out onto a well floured surface. Pat into a rectangle about 8 by 15 inches. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each rectangle crosswise into about twenty 3/4-inch-wide strips. Roll each strip into an 8-inch-long "snake" and cut in half; you will have about eighty 4-inch lengths [per recipe yield in 80 grissini]. Place on the prepared baking sheets. Let rest for 15 minutes, covered with towels.

6. In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg white with 1 tablespoon water [per recipe yielding 80 grissini]. Brush the tops of the breadsticks with the egg-white mixture.

7. Bake 2 sheets at a time, reversing pans midway, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until deep golden and crisp. If your breadsticks will not fit on 2 baking sheets, you can bake them in batches. (Store cooled breadsticks in a tightly covered container for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Re-crisp for 5 minutes at 350 degrees F/175 degrees C.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast -- (1/4 ounce)
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- PLUS
  2        tablespoons  warm water -- (110 to 115 F)
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  ground flaxseed
  2 3/4           cups  whole-wheat flour
  1 3/4           cups  bread flour

If you like to prepare your own yeast breads, here's a hearty bread adapted  from Chef Tom Ney, director of Prevention Magazine's Food Center.


In large bowl, dissolve yeast in 2 tablespoons of warm water. Set aside until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Mix in honey, oil, salt and remaining 11/4 cups warm water. Add ground flax, whole-wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour. Mix well.

Stir in enough of remaining bread flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead for 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Shape into a loaf and place in 9-by-5-inch loaf pan that has been coated with non-stick spray.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Bake in 350-degree oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until loaf is browned and sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

Makes 1 loaf (12 to 16 slices).

I just made a great bread from this book and wanted to share it with those of you who do not have the book (and if you don't, get it), and recommend it to those of you who do.

Note: It is on page 64 of the book. Those of you who have the book will notice that I made a few minor changes in places where I disagree with Maggie.

Hi-Rise's Corn Bread

Poolish:
1-1/4 cups unbleached bread flour
1-1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
3/4 cup lukewarm water

Combine the flour and yeast in a large bowl and then add water and mix thoroughly. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let ferment for about 2 hours.

Dough:
2/3 cup lukewarm water
All of the poolish
2-1/2 cups unbleached bread flour
1 cup stone-ground white (yellow is okay) cornmeal, plus
2 tablespoons stone-ground white (yellow is okay) cornmeal
3/4 cup fresh corn kernels
- (frozen is okay)
3 large eggs
- (save 1 for the glaze)
2 tablespoons honey
1-1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- (I use olive oil)
1 tablespoon salt
- (I use sea salt)

Add the water to the poolish and mix thoroughly until the poolish has loosened up. Combine the flour, cornmeal, corn, and salt in a large bowl. Add the poolish mixture, 2 of the eggs, the honey, and the oil. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it forms a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding as little flour as possible. Use a dough knife to help you turn the dough and to mash the corn kernels as you knead. Knead until the dough is tight and smooth (you know how it should feel).

Place the dough in a lightly oiled clean bowl, turning to coat the dough, cover with plastic wrap and allow to ferment until it is light, well expanded, and doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours.

Butter (I use Pam butter spray) two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cut the fermented dough in half and shape it into two balls. Shape each ball into a loaf and place seam side down in the pan. Cover and let them proof until risen 1 inch over the tops of the pans, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350F 30 minutes before you are going to bake.

Beat the remaining egg until blended and brush the tops of the loaves with it. Bake the breads until well browned, rotating them, if necessary (you know your oven). Remove the breads from the pans and allow to cool on a rack.

This bread is great for sandwiches and fantastic for toast.

                        How To Make Sourdough Sour

                        *****

Here's how to get that sour taste in your sourdough bread.

Pick an extremely busy week to bake, with only after 5 hours to do it and at least one social engagement during one of the evenings.

1. Remove starter from refrigerator and add flour and water. Let sit overnight.

2. Because you sleep late the next morning and don't have an extra 15 minutes to mix your bread recipe, throw another cup of flour and some water into the starter and go to work.

3. That evening after your social engagement, mix up part of your bread recipe:
 The required amount of starter
liquid
sugar and salt
enough of the flour to make a muffin batter consistency. Put your remaining starter back in the refrigerator and go to bed.

4. Get up 10 minutes early and add the shortening and rest of the flour to the bread. Knead, throw a dishtowel over the bowl and go to work.

5. As soon as you get home after 5, form loaves and let them rise. Figure out what time you have to go to bed and put the bread in the oven 45 minutes before that no matter how little it's risen.

WARNING: These could be bricks, but they'll be REALLY sour bricks!

Adapted from "The Food and Wine of Greece" by Diane Kochilas (St. Martin's Press, 1990)

Time: 1 1/2 hours plus 30 minutes' resting time

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt in a medium-size bowl.

2. In an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar together at high speed until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Slowly add milk and vanilla, and beat in. Add orange rind and mix well. Slowly add flour mixture to liquid, mixing until a dough mass begins to form. Move to a lightly floured surface, and knead until a smooth dough forms. Rest dough for 30 minutes.

3. Break off walnut-size pieces of dough one at a time, and roll into skinny ropes about 6 inches long. Shape these into twists, braids, coils or serpentines, making sure all biscuits are more or less the same size, so that they bake evenly.

4. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes. About half way through baking, brush with egg yolk mixed with orange juice. Biscuits should be lightly golden. Cool on a rack, and store in a jar or tin in a cool, dry place.

Yield: About 4 dozen.

                        Lecithin For Softer Loaves

  1         tablespoon  lecithin
                        -- to replace 1 tbsp oil
                        -- per 3 cups of flour

I make whole grain breads in my Breadman Ultimate nearly every day. For a nice, soft texture in my bread I replace 1 tablespoon of oil with 1 tablespoon of lecithin (for 3 cups of flour). It makes a big difference in dinner rolls and sweet rolls, too.

Lecithin is a natural dough enhancer derived from soybeans. It produces a softer loaf, extends shelf life, and improves rising. Lecithin is available at natural food stores; the liquid form is most common. Some stores also carry the granular form, including King Arthur Flour (BakersCatalogue.com).

                        French Sourdough Starter (Chef or Levain):
                        -- (Makes about 2 c or enough for 2 loaves)
  2               cups  unbleached white flour

                        flour
  2                  t  salt

French Sourdough Starter (Chef or Levain)
- (Makes about 2 c or enough for 2 loaves)
2 c unbleached white flour
1 c water

Days 1-4 : Stir together 1/2 c flour and 1/4 c water in a medium bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon or knead gently until the mixture is uniform; cover with plastic wrap. Leave overnight at room temperature ( See Note ). Every day for the next 3 days add 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup water to the mixture and stir or knead until smooth. Cover with plastic. It will expand slightly and begin to take on an acidic aroma after the second day. On day 5 you are ready to bake bread (if you start early in the day).

1 c French Sourdough Starter
2 c room temperature water
About 4-5 c unbleached white flour
-or use 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour
2 t salt

Whisk together starter and the water in a large bowl until starter is thoroughly dissolved. Combine 3 1/2 c flour and the salt in a medium bowl. Using a wooden spoon, gradually fold the flour mixture into the sourdough mixture. Flour the work surface and scrape out the dough. Using a pastry scraper to help fold the dough knead for 10-15 minutes adding more flour as needed. Shape into a ball. Rinse, dry and oil your bowl. Place dough in it and cover with plastic wrap and a towel. Let rise in warm spot for 2 hours. It will rise slightly. Form into a tight, round loaf on a lightly floured surface. Oil a 2 qt bowl and dust with cornmeal. Dust the top of the loaf with flour and place rounded side down in the bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place for 8-12 hrs (See Note) or until nearly doubled in bulk. About 30 minutes prior to baking, preheat oven to 400 degrees with a rack in the middle. Gently turn out the dough onto an unoiled baking sheet . Slash across the top with a razor blade or sharp knife. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes spraying a couple of times with water during the first 10 minutes of baking, until loaf is brown and responds to tapping with a hollow sound. Remove from oven and cool on a rack,.

Note: The warmer your room temperature is, the sourer your loaf will be. I have had differences in flavor depending on whether I baked this loaf in the summer or winter. If your starter becomes quite sour (acidic), expect the second rise time to be longer. I usually count on 10-14 hours for my dough to double. I usually time it so this is an overnight period and I bake the bread on the morning day 6. Also expect the bread to deflate a bit upon removal from the bowl and slashing. It will bake up into a flattened, not-your-prettiest loaf, but man, oh, man...what flavor! It's the only reason to baby this thing over 5 days. I recommend that the adventurous out there try this recipe. The process alone will teach you much about artisan/rustic bread making.

NOTES : I agree with Jessica that Great Breads by Martha Rose Shulman is a great book. I did not want to get into the "what is the best bread book" debate, because I have probably about 40 books on bread and like my children I hate to play "favorites" ;-) I find, however, that I have turned back to this book many times over the years, because it is well written and the recipes do work. I especially like the No Yeast Sourdough Country Bread. Although it requires a 5 day starter, it requires very little work and produces one of the sourest and crunchy loaves I've ever eaten. Since it is not fair to mention a recipe and then not share it, I will. However, I do hate typing so here is an abreviated version with my apologies to Ms Shulman (the original contains directions for making in a mixer and replenishing the starter as well).

TIP: When making Wheat Breads from scratch, after all the liquids are in the pan, the first dry ingredient added should be (if used):

Untoasted Wheat Germ, Whole Wheat Bread Flour, 50/50 White/Wheat Bread Flour, Soy Flour, Oat Flour -- then add Vital Gluten, White Bread Flour, and finally the yeast. The concept is to put the harder, drier grains closest to the water, put the Vital Gluten next to flours having little or no gluten, and always add the White flour last, topped with the yeast. Most machines have a long initial REST phase [40 minutes when the WHEAT cycle begins and this give the harder grains a chance to soak and become softer before mixing begins. [Note: Stirring the yeast into the top layer of flour to coat it is only needed for FAST 1-hour cycle processing.

  2                tsp  salt -- plus a little bit
                        more for egg glaze
  4               cups  bread or all-purpose flour -- or more (4 to 5)
                        -- as needed
  2               Tbsp  sesame seeds -- (**)
  1               Tbsp  melted butter

Dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 3 tablespoons warm water in a large mixing bowl. When mixture foams (about 5-10 minutes), stir in remaining water, sugar, the oil and all but 1 tablespoon of the beaten eggs.

Beat the remaining egg with a pinch of salt to make egg glaze and store in refrigerator until needed.

Stir the 2 tablespoons salt and the flour, 1 cup at a time, into the liquid ingredients, to obtain a dough that is stiff enough to pull away from the sides of the bowl, but soft enough to knead. The dough can also be kneaded in a mixer fitted with a dough hook or in a food processor with the dough blade.

Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes, adding flour as necessary to obtain a soft dough that is pliable but not sticky. It will be a little moister than regular bread dough.

Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover and let rise in warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk- 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Punch down.

Form the rolls, dividing into 12 equal pieces. Roll each on the work surface with the palm of your hand to form a tube 5 inches long with tapered ends. Transfer the rolls to a lightly greased baking sheet leaving 3 inches between each.

Cover with a dampened cotton dish towel and let rise in warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. You can let them rise in the refrigerator if you want, but it will take 3 to 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 350F

Brush the rolls with the reserved egg glaze and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake until golden brown and hollow sounding when lightly tapped, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes. Brush tops with melted butter. Serve warm or cool to room temperature on a wire rack.

(**) I don't remember ever using sesame seeds on ours.

NOTES : We Cubans also make Pan Dulce, except it is usually called Pan Suave. You can find it in most Cuban Bakeries and it's the bread roll used for the Cuban Medianoche Sandwich. There are some "Pan Duce" recipes for Portuguese Sweet Bread also.

I live in Hawaii, where there is a large concentration of Portuguese who came to the Islands about a 100 years ago to work in the sugar cane fields. Sometimes their Pan Duce (pronounced deuce) is called Hawaiian Bread here.

Makes one oblong loaf

1.Place the water, yeast, and flour for the biga in the bread pan. Program for the dough cycle, set a timer, and mix for 5 minutes. Turn off the machine. Unplug the machine and let the biga starter sit in the bread machine for 8 to 10 hours.

2.Place all the dough ingredients in the bread pan. Program for the dough cycle; press start. The dough will be moist and smooth, but flaccid. Take a deep breath while it is mixing; this is what bread dough is supposed to smell like--fresh and yeasty.

3.The dough cycle will have a 1-hour rise. At the beep, press reset and unplug the machine. Set a timer for another hour and leave the dough in the machine to continue to rise in the warm atmosphere.

4.Scrape the dough out of the bread pan with a dough card onto a floured work surface. Knead a few times and pat into a 12-inch oval. Roll up from the long edge into an oblong-rectangular loaf. Dust the work surface lightly with a bit of flour to prevent sticking. Cover the loaf with a clean tea towel on the work surface and let rest 30 minutes.

5.Line a baking sheet with parchment. Carefully pick up the loaf and place it on the baking sheet. As you pick it up from both ends and carry it through the air, it will naturally stretch and extend slightly, which will create a flattish loaf about 14 inches long and 5 inches wide. Dust the top with flour. Cover again and let rest 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 F, lined with a baking stone or tiles on the center rack, if desired.

6.Do not slash or glaze the loaf. Place the pan directly on the oven rack, or on the stone if using, and immediately reduce the oven temperature to 425 F. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the surface of the loaf is a deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped with your finger. Remove the loaves from the pans immediately to a cooling rack.

                        more flour as needed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- for the bowl
                        ---
                        Optional egg wash:
  1                     egg
                        water or milk

DOUBLE RECIPE

1. WASH YOUR HANDS! Begin with 2 1/2 cups of 110 F WATER (a little warmer than body temperature) in a medium-large bowl.

2. Stir in 2 teaspoons SUGAR or HONEY and 1 PACKAGE YEAST (or 2 teaspoons of BULK YEAST).

3. Wait until the sweetened yeast water foams, in about 5 - 10 minutes.

4. Stir in 2 1/2 cups ORGANIC UNBLEACHED WHITE FLOUR, 1/2 cup at a time. Optional: substitute 1/2 cup ORGANIC WHOLEWHEAT FLOUR for 1/2 cup of the UNBLEACHED WHITE FLOUR).

5. Cover the bowl with a wet towel, plastic wrap, or a larger bowl until your batter has doubled in size, which will take 1 - 2 hours.

***It's time for the cheese!***

6. Coarsely grate 1/2 pound (2 1/2 cups) ASIAGO or PARMEGIANO or ROMANO CHEESE into the batter. Stir in 1 - 2 tablespoons RED PEPPER FLAKES and/or 1 tablespoon GROUND BLACK PEPPER, then 1 tablespoon SALT and 1/2 cup OLIVE OIL or MELTED (or SOFTENED) BUTTER.

7. Add MORE FLOUR, 1/2 cup at a time, and stir it in until the dough is too thick to stir (you will use about 2 1/2 cups more total).

8. Add ADDITIONAL HANDFULS OF FLOUR (not many will be needed) and turn the bowl as the FLOUR is incorporated by hand into your dough, until the floury dough comes away from the bowl.

9. Dump the floury dough out of the bowl. Clean your bowl and spatula or spoon with DRY FLOUR.

10. Knead the dough for 10 minutes, sprinkling FLOUR on the counter to keep your dough from sticking, as necessary. PUSH-TURN-FOLD!

11. Pour 1 tablespoon OLIVE OIL into the bowl, and spread the OIL inside the entire bowl.

12. Push the dough into your bowl, and turn over the dough.

13. Cover the bowl with a moist towel, plastic wrap, or a larger bowl.

14. Let your dough rise until it has doubled in size (1 - 2 hours). Scrape, scrub and sponge your counter surface now.

15. Press your dough down to deflate it, and knead it again on the counter for one minute, sprinkling a tiny bit of FLOUR onto the counter if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. If you have the time, give the dough an additional 30 - 60 minute rise, to produce a finer texture, deflating the dough before the next step.

16. Cut your dough into pieces half the size of your desired loaves (or golfball size if making small rolls). Knead each piece for 30 seconds (using FLOUR to prevent sticking, if necessary), then pinch shut the open bottom seams and roll your dough into an elastic ball.

17. Form your dough pieces into the desired shapes (using extra FLOUR, if needed), and set them in oiled loaf pans, baguette forms, or a floured peel or cutting board, while you preheat your oven and, possibly, your stone or baking sheet to 400 F for 15 - 20 minutes. Cover the dough with a slightly damp towel, plastic wrap, or large bowl.

18. Score the risen dough lengthwise down the middle. Optional: beat an EGG, stir in a few drops of WATER or MILK, then gently brush the top of your risen dough with the EGG WASH.

19. Place the filled loaf pans (or forms) into the oven, or carefully slide the unbaked loaves or rolls onto your stone or baking sheet. Bake until the bottoms are quite firm to the touch, which will take 30 - 45 minutes for bread and 15 - 30 minutes for rolls, depending upon dough quantity and oven performance.

20. Cool the completed loaves or rolls on a cooling rack. Try not to eat too much when your pepper cheese bread is still hot (good luck).

21. After 5 hours, double-wrap and keep at room temperature (or refrigerate) what you haven't eaten (ha!).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  flour -- (5 to 5 1/4)
  4                tsp  salt
  4              Tbsp.  corn oil
  3 1/2           cups  water -- (3 1/2 to 4)
  2           packages  active dry yeast

Mix flour, salt, oil and instant yeast (to be mixed into the flour like baking powder) together and work in the water. The dough should be firm and come off the sides of your mixing bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured table and knead thoroughly, about 10 minutes. Knead each half by itself and mix them up again.

Divide dough into small balls a little larger than a squash ball, which you roll between your palms, applying pressure. Put these balls under a dry cloth. Once all the dough is divided up, take the first ball and roll it out into a small circle with thickness of not more than 1/4 inch. Place these circles onto a floured wooden board (use wood, as plastic material will make dough stick to it and bread will not bake with a hollow middle). Cover the circles with a dry cloth and let them rest for about one hour. Pre-heat your oven on the highest possible heat, place these circles upside down (the top becomes the bottom on the baking sheet) onto a lightly greased baking sheet and bake them only until very lightly colored. The bread will rise in the oven into big blown up balls, at which time they are more or less baked. Place them on a wire rack, and when cooled a little, press them together. These breads can be frozen for weeks and when needed, just put them into oven for!

Here's a terrific recipe I uncovered just the other day which had been
posted on a recipe site:

Place all ingredients into bread machine. Program for dough and press start. At the end of the cycle, punch down the dough to rest and turn out onto a lightly floured board. Divide dough and allow to rest for five to 10 minutes. Divide each half of dough into 12 even pieces. Turn the ball of dough inside out and pinch the ends together on the bottom. This will give you a smooth ball. Place seam side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Allow to rise 30 - 40 minutes or until doubled. Bake in an oven preheated to 425 F for 15 to 18 minutes or until of desired brown-ness.

I used a cornstarch glaze with poppy seeds. These looked lovely and were really delicious.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  dry active yeast
  2 1/2           cups  warm water -- (98 to 115F.)
  2 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1             medium  high-starch potato - such as russet
                        -- (1 to 2 -  enough for 1 cup mashed)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  rye flour
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
                        PLUS up to 1 cup -- if needed
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting

Makes 1 loaf, serves 8

TOTAL TIME: about 7 hours, including time for the dough to rise

TIME TO PREPARE: about 1 hour

COOKING TIME: about 1 hour, 40 minutes

EQUIPMENT: baking stone, baker's peel (optional)

Potato softens the dough, caraway seasons it, and rye flour adds hearty flavor, as well as fiber and B vitamins. Together, they make a chewy, delicious loaf. It's good toast, too!

Heat the oven to 425 F.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon of the yeast and 1/2 cup of the water. Let the mixture sit until the yeast dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 2 hours in a warm, draft-free place.

Meanwhile, scrub the potatoes and carve an X at each end. Place on a baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 50 minutes. When they're cool enough to handle, strip away the peel, and mash them.

Transfer the yeast mixture to a large bowl. Gently stir in the remaining yeast, water, and all-purpose flour, and the salt. Add the mashed potatoes, rye flour, and the whole wheat flour, incorporating it 1 cup at a time, until you have a dough that is soft and pliant, but firm enough to handle. (It helps to moisten your hands while you knead.) Or use the dough hook on your Mixmaster, kneading by machine until the dough pulls away from the bowl and forms a ball around the hook.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it's smooth and springy, about 5 minutes. Add flour only when absolutely necessary to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest on a lightly floured surface while you wash out the mixing bowl.

Lightly grease the inside of the mixing bowl, then place the dough inside, turning it once to coat it lightly. Cover with a light-weight towel and set aside until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough and knead it inside the bowl for 1 minute to press out the air. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, sprinkle the dough with the caraway seeds, and knead for about 4 minutes, until the dough is springy and the seeds are well distributed throughout.

Shape the dough into a ball. Cupping it between your hands, rotate it while tucking the dough under to form a perfect round. Dust the center of a large dish towel with about 1/3 cup flour, and rub the flour into it. Place the towel, floured side up, in a bowl about 12 inches in diameter. Place the round of dough upside down in the bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a draft-free place to rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Forty-five minutes before you plan to bake the bread, place the baking stone on the center rack in the oven, and heat to 450F.

Sprinkle a baking sheet or baker's peel with cornmeal. Using a dish towel to assist, you carefully turn the dough out of the bowl onto the baking sheet or peel so the top side is down. Using a serrated knife, quickly score the top of the loaf with 3 slashes or an X and put it in the oven, either on the baking sheet or by sliding it off the peel onto the baking stone.

Close the oven door for about 15 seconds. Open the oven and squirt inside with water to make steam, using a water pistol or a spritzer bottle. If you don't have either, simply splash water from a cup onto the oven floor. (Make sure you don't splash the hot lightbulb.) Close the door for 30 seconds, then repeat.

Bake until the loaf is golden brown and, when tapped on the bottom, sounds as if it's hollow inside, about 40 minutes. If the bread is browning but doesn't sound hollow, cover it loosely with foil, lower the heat to 400, and continue baking until it's done, checking every 5 minutes.

Transfer the loaf to a wire rack and let it cool completely before slicing.

BREAD MACHINE OPTION: Place all of the ingredients in your breadmaker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once the dough has risen, take it out of the machine, shape it as directed in the recipe, and continue to follow the recipe from that point.

                        -- 1 loaf:
  2               cups  sourdough
  1 1/3           cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  buttermilk powder -- opt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

                        -- 3 loaves:
  6               cups  sourdough
  4 7/8           cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  buttermilk powder -- opt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     5/8           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- (3 to 4)

The following recipe always comes out sour even without the 3 day  method.  I have no idea why.

Bake on unglazed tile or a pizza stone on the bottom rack of oven  to make it nice and crusty.

RE: the 1/5 c. measurements ... I just eyeball it.  That's how it worked out when I converted it from a yeast recipe:

2 loafs yeast bread (source recipe):
5 c. flour
2 tsp salt
1 T. yeast
2 t. sugar
2 c water
2 T olive oil

Mix flour and salt. Put yeast in water (if making the yeast version) . Stir well. Let sit 10 minutes. Stir again and mix into flour, along with oil. Knead bread. Let rise for 1 hour. Punch out bubbles and form loaf, let rise for 1/2 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake 30-40 minutes. I lined small Corning dish with dish towel and let bread rise in it. I took it out by lifting it out by the towel, transferred it to one hand and quickly put it on the stone right side up.

Re; refreshing bread, I freeze bread tightly wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in a plastic bag with other wrapped loaves. To refresh frozen bread, remove from plastic but leave loaf wrapped in foil, thaw in 350 F oven or toaster oven for 20 minutes (baguettes), 25 or more if thicker. The crust is usually fine but if it is a little soft, unwrap the foil, turn off the oven and leave the loaf in the oven for 2 minutes more.

To refresh unfrozen bread, 5 minutes in a 350 F oven (turned off) will usually do it but the crust might get brittle and "crumbly".  ["Werner Gansz" <dwgansz@prodigy.net>]

To refresh bread: My mother used to put bagel, or anything else with a good crust, in a brown paper bag with the end folded over & stapled, then sprinkled with water. That went into a 300 F oven for about 10 minutes...longer if frozen... [Epwerth15@aol.com]

---

In reading recent postings regarding ways to refresh bread, I was reminded of something I recently read in my Rival Crockpot Cooking cookbook that dealt with reviving stale potato chips and crackers. Use your crockpot instead of one of those expensive crispers you see in catalogs and on the net. Place them in the crockpot but DO NOT cover. Heat on the Low setting for 2 to 4 hours, and you have crisp, warm crackers or chips (not to mention a wonderful smelling kitchen!).  [Corinaesq@aol.com]

Brush undiluted evaporated milk twice on the bread, first before it is
placed in the oven (or halfways through the baking) and again about 5
minutes before it is removed from the oven.  It will finish to a nice
russet color.

  3        tablespoons  King Arthur Sour

After tweaking numerous times a rye bread recipe from "Secrets of a Jewish Baker," the bread not only does not taste like the Brooklyn, NY, bread I grew up on, it no longer rises. Can you tell from the current form of my recipe why the yeast is being killed? Too much KA Sour? I appreciate any suggestions you may have. The recipe (made in bread machine except for shaping, final rise and oven baking) follows.

Everyone, here's the response I got today from King Arthur when I asked what I was doing wrong with my sour rye recipe, which was no longer rising after numerous tweaks. I was using 3 tablespoons of King Arthur's Deli Sour, which is evidently far too much:

Because the sour is highly acidic, I would use no more than 1 teaspoon in the three cup recipe. Beyond that amount, your loaves will be dense and heavy as the acid breaks down the gluten strands.

Test Kitchen: Breadboxes, the Best Thing Since Unsliced Bread

MARIANNE ROHRLICH, NYT

BEADBOXES, after all these years, matter again.

As long as bread was mass-produced plastic food in plastic wrap, protected by an army of multisyllabic preservatives, no one needed to worry about it.

But now that the fresh stuff, the bread with a great crust and moist interior, is back, the reasons for the breadbox are clear: store one of those beautiful loaves in a plastic bag and it will turn into a tough hunk of foam overnight. A breadbox should keep it fresh for up to three days.

To be honest, though, I first wanted a breadbox for a less practical reason. All of a sudden, there are a lot of great looking ones. Houseware designers have become enamored of the breadbox, as they have of old-fashioned toasters and blenders and other artifacts of the 1950's kitchen. Except this time, they're not content with just retro reproductions.

The smooth capsule made by Alessi, shown above, looks as if it touched down from outer space. A breadbox by Eva Solo has curved steel sides and an industrial-looking black plastic flap. Michael Graves's breadbox is a riff on sturdy 50's design in chrome and ivory plastic. All of them are a vast improvement over that pile of crumpled paper bags shoved onto the counter.

But I wondered, is choosing a breadbox just a matter of style, or are there functional considerations, too? After selecting five based on looks alone, I put them to the test. First, I did a little homework. Just how does a breadbox work, anyway? Bread, I learned, has to breathe for its crust to stay crisp, and that is why it suffocates in a plastic bag or in the refrigerator. But left in a paper bag on the counter, it will dry out in a day or so.

A breadbox - basically a foot-square container with an opening that's not airtight - creates a controlled environment somewhere between those extremes. The moisture from the bread raises the humidity in the box, but air circulation keeps it from getting as moist as in a sealed plastic bag.

Harold McGee, the author of "On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen" (Scribner, 1984), explained that the more bread in the box, the higher the humidity, and hence, the less crisp the crust. A box with just a little bread will have lower humidity, and maintain crispness better.

"You have to make a choice with bread," he said. "Some like it chewy, some like it crisp."

With all of that in mind, I set out to test five models: the oval Gnam by Alessi, the Bread Bin by Eva Solo, the 50's-style box by Michael Graves for Alessi, a reproduction cannister-style box from Martha Stewart and a double-decker plastic model from Lillian Vernon. I filled the breadboxes on a Sunday and, until the following Wednesday, opened them every evening to test for crispness and moistness. Here is what I learned.

Lesson No. 1: Breadboxes are big. Very big.

I never realized how much equipment I had until I needed more than a foot of counter space for each breadbox. I filled each one with an assortment of baked goods: chunks of fresh country loaves, crusty rolls, half a baguette. I kept some in paper bags, and left others unwrapped.

Lesson No. 2: Breadboxes are not designed for baguettes.

None of the boxes were long enough to store a whole baguette. (Of course, people who really care about bread will tell you baguettes should be eaten the day they are baked.)

Lesson No. 3: Most breadboxes are not designed to hold tall breads, either. Be prepared to cut a big boule in half.

The only one ample enough for plump loaves was the reproduction box by Martha Stewart ($62 from the Martha by Mail catalog, 800-950-7130 or www.marthabymail .com). The enameled steel box, in white, beige or green, has a square canister-style design, with a lid on top, and is taller than it is wide or long (11 1/2 inches by 8 1/2 inches, and 12 inches high). It holds a large inventory, though getting at something on the bottom meant rooting around.

The tightest squeeze was the Gnam ($69 at S. Feldman Housewares, 1304 Madison Avenue, at 92nd Street). The box's beautiful elongated shape was also its shortcoming, and a relatively small opening didn't help. Still, the 19-by-12-by-6 1/2-inch container, which comes in bright yellow, purple and orange, holds medium-size flatter loaves, and rolls and smaller baked goods.

Lesson No. 4: Throw away the paper bags.

Because of the humidity that builds up, paper gets damp. The unwrapped breads seemed to stay the freshest; their crusts were still acceptably crisp three days later. The breads left in paper bags had soggy, chewy crusts.

The Eva Solo box had a different sort of humidity problem: the stylish floppy flap didn't close tightly, and was so large that when opened it completely released the moisture. The bread in this box seemed drier after two days. The flap also required two hands - one to hold it open, the other to reach in the box - which was inconvenient. The box was almost as ample as the Martha Stewart model, at 7 inches high by 17 inches long and 10 inches deep ($103 from www.tabletools.com or 888-211-6603).

Lesson No. 5: Don't overfill.

It's tempting to use a breadbox as a storage bin for crackers and stray baked goods. Since air circulation is so important, you want to be careful about overcrowding.

For a compact kitchen, the double-decker model from the Lillian Vernon catalog ($29.98, 800-285-5555) is the best fit. It is the narrowest, at 11 3/8 inches, but its two compartments are relatively high and roomy. It is 12 1/4 inches high by 7 1/2 inches deep. With a white plastic frame and clear compartments, it is not as attractive as the others, but it is a space saver. The sliding doors worked well and stayed open by themselves.

The Michael Graves box ($239 at Bergdorf Goodman) did not always open or close smoothly; its sliding chrome "garage door" went off the track from time to time. But it held a good quantity, and the inside proportions were right. The box, in chrome and ivory or dark gray plastic, is 17 3/8 inches long by 9 1/2 inches deep and 8 inches high.

Lesson No. 6: Looks aren't everything.

The boxes all worked well - up to three days later, I still had acceptably fresh bread in all of them, except for the Eva Solo. And they all certainly contained the countertop mess, bags as well as crumbs.

But I have to admit, as striking as the futuristic jelly bean Gnam is - and it was my favorite, visually - it isn't the one I would buy. I want the plain-Jane double- decker from Lillian Vernon. It not only filled the bill, but it also fit my counter.

                   Tips On Achieving Holes In Baguettes

I find that in order to get the characteristic holes in baguettes the shaped loaves need to be overproofed (by normal loaf standards) and risen to at least 2 1/2 times and preferably 3 times the original volume. And yes, it is easy to really overdo it and get pancake loaves but you've got to give the bread a chance to develop the typical baguette texture. Of course you'll be hard pressed to get a loaf as holey as a french commercial baker with his steam-injected hearth ovens running at over 280 C but you can get pretty close. Are you dumping boiling water into a hot roasting pan on the base of the oven just before putting the loaves in? The steam generated is important in the expansion of the crumb. It also helps expansion (and therefore holyness) if you spray water into the loaves' slashes just before they go into the oven but the volume of the final proof is the most important factor.

The loaves should be treated gently in the transfer to the oven as they are very fragile when proofed as much as they should be. If you've never used parchment or bake-o-glide to proof loaves on you might consider it for future bakes.

This indicates that the bread has not "fully proofed", i.e., not risen to the extent of the leaven you've used, when you put it in the hot oven to bake. You always get some "oven spring" during the first 5 (more or less) minutes after putting a loaf into a hot oven. If it still has significant rising to do the interior of the loaf will be still expanding after the crust has begun to harden. If the leaven is powerful enough it will overcome the hardened crust and tear or split it.

This used to happen to me a lot, I think I've learned to actually form my loaves a little smaller and have had a lot less trouble with this over the last year or so.

You must judge: Are you making the loaves so big that they can't rise fully without overflowing your baking pan? or are you just not letting them rise long enough? It's the same thing, really, but the cure depends on whether there is ROOM in the pan to rise more or not. Either let them rise longer before baking, or make them smaller so you CAN let them rise longer before baking.

                      What Is "Bread Machine" Yeast?

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00

                        *****

It appears there is a lot of misunderstanding about what the yeast is in jars labeled "Bread Machine Yeast"

The major change from the very moist cake yeast was the pouches of "Active Dry Yeast."

When countertop breadmaking machines arrived for home use, there was a need for a yeast form that could be used in the machines without the need to pre soak, as is done with Active Dry Yeast when preparing bread dough for traditional oven baking.

The resulting new product was called "Bread Machine Yeast." Its performance for fermentation and proofing was similar to Active Dry Yeast. The product sold today is *** still the same formulation.***

Therefore, when there is a need for a faster or more aggressive yeast, especially for use in FAST 1-hour breadmaking machine cycles, the better yeast to use is Quick-Rise, RapidRise, or Perfect Rise.

To protect the yeast from the early heating which occurs in FAST cycles, stir the yeast slightly into the top layer of flour to coat the yeast granules with flour. Use caution to not stir too deep or into the corners which might get the yeast wet.

Red Star Yeast consultants recommend for FAST 1-hour cycles the following *** total *** fast-rising yeast be used:

2 tsp for 1 lb loaf  (often too small for FAST baking)
3 tsp [ 1 Tbs ] for 1 1/2 lb loaf  [typical 14-oz prepackaged mixes]
4 tsp [ 1 Tbs + 1 tsp ] for 2 lb loaf  [typical 20-oz prepackaged mixes]
5 tsp [ 1 Tbs + 2 tsp ] for 2 1/2 lb loaf

[Note 1: Always put yeast in last on top of bread flour, and stir it around in the topmost layer of flour so the yeast granules get coated with flour. Do NOT stir deep or into corners where the yeast might get damp.]

[Note 2: Be very aware of the SMALL quantity of yeast provided in boxes of prepackaged mixes (4 grams = 1 tsp), versus 7 grams (2-1/4 tsp) in a normal 3-strip package.

While these fast-rising yeast can be used for "rapid" 2-hour cycles, many find the slower acting "Acting Dry Yeast" and "Bread Machine Yeast" produce a nicer texture. However, add an additional one teaspoon of yeast to compensate for the shorter rise/proofing times.

                        Whole Grain Flaxseed Bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- (1 1/2 lb loaf)
  1 1/4           cups  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1 1/2      teaspoons  liquid lecithin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  whole flaxseed - ground
                        -- (measure it whole then grind it)
  2        tablespoons  gluten flour
  3        tablespoons  dried milk
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast

I strongly suggest grinding the flaxseed into meal using the coffee grinder. If you grind the flaxseed, a much higher percentage will be digested and absorbed by the body, which is what you want since flaxseed contains those highly beneficial omega oils among other good things. I make flaxseed bread on a regular basis. Here is the recipe (found on bread recipe.com, but modified as follows) which will produce a healthy, moist, almost nutty kind of loaf. Great toasted with some apple butter...or all by itself untoasted.


Place all ingredients in bread machine. Select wheat cycle and start. If your machine has flexibility, then allow the bread to rise an extra 10 minutes by turning off the machine after the end of the last rise, then set to bake for 45 minutes on the light crust selection.

                  Yeast Guidelines And Adapting Recipes

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

Resulting from their many years of testing experience and user feedback,
Red Star has formulated and documented guidelines which seldom fail. Those
published below are safe, tried and true for most recipes.

It is true that individual bakers WILL perfect a recipe under their own
unique conditions which seems to refute one or more Red Star guide. But the
proportions in that recipe will most likely *not* work for 90% of the other
recipes you want to convert. The Red Star guidelines will work without
making a mess.

The following suggestions can be expected to satisfactorily convert any
traditional recipe, and adapt a 'normal' machine recipe to a "Rapid" or
"FAST" machine cycle.

For purposes of this discussion, the *total* cycle times (without DELAY) are:
Normal = 3 to 3 1/2 hours
Rapid  = 2 to 2 1/2 hours
FAST   = one hour

YEAST GUIDELINES and ADAPTING RECIPES

1. Converting a NORMAL machine recipe to a RAPID cycle:
ADD one additional teaspoon of yeast - regardless of loaf size.

2. Converting a NORMAL machine recipe to a FAST cycle:

a. Use very warm water or milk (115-125 F) do NOT exceed.
[Note 1: Do NOT use the DELAY function as the water/milk will cool off.]

b. Increase water or milk liquids by 1 to 2 Tablespoons.

c. Decrease salt:
      1/4 tsp less for 1 lb loaf  (often too small for FAST baking)
      3/8 tsp less for 1 1/2 lb loaf
      1/2 tsp less for 2 lb loaf
Obviously you can't do anything about salt reduction in prepackaged mixes.

d. Add Vital Wheat Gluten:
      1 tsp per cup of bread flour
      2 tsp for 1 lb loaf  (often too small for FAST baking)
      3 tsp [ 1 Tbs ] for 1-1/2 lb loaf  [typical 14-oz prepackaged mixes]
      4 tsp [ 1 Tbs + 1 tsp ] for 2 lb loaf  [typical 20-oz prepackaged mixes]
      5 tsp [ 1 Tbs + 2 tsp ] for 2-1/2 lb loaf
[Note 1: Contains ascorbic acid, Vitamin C, which is a "conditioner."]
[Note 2: The guideline of 1 Tbs Gluten per loaf is okay for Normal or Rapid
cycles.]

e. Do NOT use Active Dry Yeast from any brand in a FAST cycle!
     Use Red Star "Quick-Rise" Yeast
     Or Red Star "Bread Machine" Yeast
     Or Fleischmann's "RapidRise" Yeast
     Or Fleischmann's "Bread Machine" Yeast
     Or SAF "Perfect Rise" Yeast.
Red Star "Bread Machine" Yeast (7-oz jar) is the earlier formulation -- the
second generation formulations [preferred by some] are:
"Quick-Rise",  "RapidRise" and "Perfect Rise." Formulations *are* identical
in the 3-strip packages and the 4-oz jars bearing the same names.

Total yeast to be used:
2 tsp for 1 lb loaf  (often too small for FAST baking)
3 tsp [ 1 Tbs ] for 1 1/2 lb loaf  [typical 14-oz prepackaged mixes]
4 tsp [ 1 Tbs + 1 tsp ] for 2 lb loaf  [typical 20-oz prepackaged mixes]
5 tsp [ 1 Tbs + 2 tsp ] for 2-1/2 lb loaf
[Note 1: Always put yeast in last on top of bread flour, and stir it around
in the topmost layer of flour so the yeast granules get coated with flour.
Do NOT stir deep or into corners where the yeast might get damp.]
[Note 2: Be very aware of the SMALL quantity of yeast provided in
prepackaged mixes (4 grams = 1 tsp), versus 7 grams (2-1/4 tsp) in a normal
3-strip package.

f. Sweet, high fat, or fruit type mixes or recipes may not be satisfactory
in a FAST cycle.

3. Do you have a horizontal bread pan? Tired of small ends?
Forget about baking one-pound loaves in a horizontal pan (but making one
pound batches of dough for baking in an oven is fine).
14-15 oz bread mix packages yield 1 1/2 lb loaves.
19-20 oz bread mix packages yield 2 lb loaves.

Converting a prepackaged mix to a larger loaf size:
For each additional 1/2 lb increase desired --
Add 1/3 cup liquid, 2 tsp oil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 Tbs sugar, one cup white(*)
bread flour, 1 tsp Gluten, 1/2 tsp yeast (Quick-Rise, Perfect Rise,
RapidRise, or Bread Machine)
[ Note 1: (*) If a wheat recipe, consider using one cup 50/50 bread flour.]
[ Note 2: Plan ahead -- put in all wet ingredients before any dry! And
don't forget the 'wet' items required by the mix instructions! ]

4. Want to convert a traditional 'scratch' bread recipe to machine baking?
Rule 1: Always obtain success first while using/adjusting a normal cycle
(3-hour), before attempting a Rapid (2-hour) or FAST (1-hour) cycle.
Rule 2: Add 1 Tbs Vital Wheat Gluten
Rule 3: Ignore the yeast specified in the recipe, and use 1/2 Tbs
Quick-Rise or Bread Machine Yeast per each cup of bread flour in the recipe.
Rule 4: For each cup of bread flour, the other ingredients should be close
to:  1/3 C liquid, 2 tsp fat/oil, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 Tbs sweetener. [Note:
never use artificial sweeters; they won't help fermentation.]

5. What is the most  ***critical***  ingredient?
The amount of water and its temperature. Be precise in measurement. Be
consistent.

a. Always use a see-through measuring cup. Fill with liquid ALMOST to the
amount needed. Then always set the measuring cup on the counter. Use
another easy-pour container to add liquid to the measuring cup; bend over,
both eyes level, and stop adding when the liquid trough/bottom is at the
measure line desired. Such lines have a thickness. The difference? from
bottom of the line to the top? About 1 tsp. The difference from the
trough/bottom of the water to the 'top' of the water surface climbing the
side? About 1 Tbs.

b. How you sight - eyes on the same level as the line to avoid parallax,
and what is used to guide the measure by, makes a BIG difference. NEVER
lift the measuring cup to your erect eye level, as you'll never
consistently obtain the same measure.

c. Don't measure 1 cup liquid using a 2-cup or 4-cup measure; always use
the smallest measure possible for accuracy.

d. If you need more than a precise measure mark, do not GUESS! Measure to
the most convenient lesser mark, and then use precise 1 tsp or 1 Tbs
additions so you can record and repeat it later (or less or more as
needed). 3 tsp = 1 Tbs;   2 Tbs = 1/8 C

5. How fast do thermometers respond?
Candy Mercury Stem - very slow [not recommended]
Meat Large Dial/Needle - slow [not recommended]
Meat Small Dial/Needle - fast [good, suggested for microwave use]
Small LED probe - a bit faster [my preference]
                   and often has memory for high/low readings
                   and can be switched between F and C reading.

Never guess at temperatures:
a. 115-125 F liquids for a FAST cycle.
b. 80-85 F liquids for Normal and Rapid cycles. [Note: be consistent,
varying 10 degrees makes a difference.]
c. Use the same temperature water to fill and preheat the bread pan without
the paddle, and be sure to dry it thoroughly or the liquid measure will be
wrong.
d. The machine should be at room temperature for each batch, or the
proof/rise results will be wildly different each time.

TIP: Put one drop of Canola oil in the paddle hole or on the shaft.
The paddle will come off easier when finished. If the paddle is stuck, fill
the pan with warm soapy water and let it soak for 10 minutes, but do NOT
set the pan IN any water. Wash/dry pan by hand.

TIP: Want consistency in baking finish? ALWAYS remove the bread loaf as
soon as it is finished!
