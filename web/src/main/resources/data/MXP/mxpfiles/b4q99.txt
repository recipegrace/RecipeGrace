  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  olive or vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  honey or maple syrup
  3               cups  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or -- (3 to 3
     1/2                )
                        Stone-Ground Whole Wheat Flour
     1/4           cup  sunflower -- sesame or flax
                        seeds, or a combination (optional)
  1         tablespoon  vital wheat gluten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

The following recipe is one we worked out for the Zojirushi. It makes a firm, sweet loaf of golden bread. It shouldn't be hard adapting it to your own machine; all you need to know is what proportion of flour/liquid/yeast your machine functions best with. Take a look at the dough after it's kneaded for 20 minutes or so; it should be smooth, not sticky (too little flour) or lumpy (too little liquid), forming a nice ball. If the dough looks good at this point, you're probably all set.

                        -- (I increased the yeast 1/2 teas)

I used the Homemade method and programmed the machine as follows:

Preheat -off

I used Light crust, but Gloria uses Medium Recipe:

ZOJIRUSHI WHOLE WHEAT BREAD (V-20- model)

Gloria suggests just using the Saf Yeast for all bread recipes, but for the northwest area, increasing yeast in the fall from 1/4 to 1/2 teas. Decrease the yeast for warmer months.

NOTES : This recipe was given to me from Gloria at our local Bosch Kitchen Center and was developed by Gloria specifically for the ZO V-20 It was the first loaf of bread I made in my new machine and it came out tender and light and very tasty. It raised beautifully! ( My husband is not a fan of whole wheat bread, but he really liked this loaf).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Milk
     1/2          cups  Packed Light Brown Sugar
  1               Tbsp  Salt
     1/4          cups  Butter
  1               cups  Warm Water -- (110-115F)
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  8               cups  Whole Wheat Flour -- Unsifted
  3               Tbsp  Butter -- Melted

In saucepan, heat milk till bubbles form around edge of pan; remove from
heat.  Add sugar, salt, and 1/4 cup of butter; stir until butter melts;
cool to lukewarm.  If possible check temperature of water with
thermometer.  Sprinkle yeast over water in large bowl.

Stir to dissolve yeast; stir in the lukewarm milk mixture.  Add 4 cups
whole-wheat flour; beat vigorously with wooden spoon until smooth.
Gradually add rest of whole-wheat flour; mix in last of it with hand until
dough is stiff enough to leave side of bowl.

Turn dough out on lightly floured pastry cloth.  Knead until dough is
smooth and elastic--5 minutes.  Place in lightly greased large bowl; turn
dough to bring up greased side.  Cover with towel; let rise in warm place
(85F), draft free, until doubled--1 hour.

Again, turn dough on cloth.  Halve, let rest, covered, 10 minutes. Cut each
halve into two.  With palms, roll each part into a 12-inch strip.  Twist
two strips together three times; press ends even; pinch ends to
seal.  Place in greased 9x5x2 3/4 inch pan.

Brush surface with a little melted butter.  Repeat with other half. Let
loaves rise in warm place, free from drafts, until sides come to the top of
pans and tops are rounded--1 hour.  Place rack in middle of oven.  Preheat
oven to 400F.  Bake 35-40 minutes.

Crust will be a deep golden-brown and loaves will sound hollow when
tapped.  (If crust is too brown after baking 25 minutes, cover with foil or
brown paper.)  Turn out of pans onto racks; brush tops with melted
butter.  Serve warm or cold.

Makes 2 loaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/8           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  almond paste*
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4           cup  cracked wheat or bulgur
     3/4           cup  King Arthur 100% White Wheat Flour
  2               cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  3        tablespoons  nonfat dried milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  regular instant yeast

*If you don't have access to prepared almond paste, substitute 1/4 cup blanched slivered almonds ground to a paste with 1 tablespoon sugar.

Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Basic White Bread, and press Start. Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water.

Yield: one 7 to 8-inch loaf

The addition of almond paste gives this loaf a tender moistness; it's also a good complement to the nutty flavor of cracked wheat. The almond flavor isn't pronounced, but adds a delicate hint of sweetness.

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  egg whites -- unbeaten
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  butter -- (2 sticks) melted
                        and cooled
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4           cup  blanched almonds -- finely ground or
                        chopped
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  freshly grated lemon peel (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F. Beat the egg whites with the sugar and salt for 2 or 3 minutes until the sugar is dissolved and the egg whites are thick and white. Blend in the melted butter and then gently fold in the flour, almonds, lemon juice and peel.

Using two teaspoons, drop blobs of dough, well apart, onto a lightly greased nonstick cookie sheet. Bake them for 10 to 12 minutes.

With a spatula, lift them off the cookie sheet to a cooling rack soon after they come out of the oven. They are somewhat reluctant to part company with the sheet once they have thoroughly cooled.

In its original form, this recipe stood out for the strength of its tantalizing ingredients. It was finally reworked into this delicious, crisp cookie, redolent with almond and a hint of lemon. These are best made in dry weather. This recipe makes between 3 and 4 dozen cookies. A Tip from King Arthur Flour: To get maximum amount of juice out of a lemon, first run it under hot water. Then roll it around on your counter with your hand putting on a fair amount of pressure. This helps to release all those tiny cells of juice inside. If you're going to grate it for peel, do that before you warm and soften it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  2               cups  boiling water
     1/2           cup  molasses
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (2 to 3)
  3               cups  King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat or
                        -- 100% White Whole Wheat Flour

Dissolve the yeast in the 1/2 cup of water. Add the honey and 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour. Let sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to get going.

In a separate bowl, sprinkle the cornmeal over the boiling water and add the molasses and salt. This mixture needs to be stirred constantly while it cools so that the cornmeal doesn't lump. When this has cooled to 100F, stir in the yeast mixture.

Add 2 cups of the whole wheat flour and stir until well combined. Add the remaining cup of whole wheat flour and then the all-purpose flour, one cup at a time, stirring until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it, adding flour as needed, until it's smooth and no longer sticky; it has a tendency to be tacky. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free spot. The dough needs to double in size, which will take about 2 hours.

Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it briefly to expel any air bubbles. Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Form each into a loaf shape. Place the loaves in greased standard 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pans. Cover the loaves with a damp towel and let them rise until they are cresting a good inch over the tops of the pans.

While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the loaves for 35 minutes, or until well browned and the loaves are baked through. Yield: 2 loaves, 16 half-inch slices per loaf

The name Anadama, as the story goes, was originally an oath bestowed upon Anna by her hungry fisherman husband. It seems that she had abandoned him to a meal of cornmeal mush (hasty pudding) and molasses. He, in a burst of frustration and creativity, added flour, salt, butter and yeast and produced this now familiar and traditional New England bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Crust:
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- frozen in its
                        wrapper
     1/2           cup  finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
  3        tablespoons  cold water
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
                        Filling:
  3                     medium-to-large Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored
                        and
                        sliced 1/4-inch thick (3 to 4)
  1               dash  salt
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
                        Topping:
     1/2           cup  + 2 tablespoons King Arthur Unbleached
                        All-Purpose Flour
     2/3           cup  maple sugar OR 1/3 cup granulated sugar
                        and 1/3 cup maple syrup
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1                cup  chopped walnuts

The Crust*: In the bowl of a food processor equipped with the metal blade, combine the flour and salt. Remove the metal blade, and install the shredding disk. Using the pusher, shred the frozen butter atop the flour/salt mixture. Put the metal blade back on, add the shredded Cheddar, and pulse a couple of times to distribute the butter and cheese. Sprinkle on the water and lemon juice, and pulse five to six times, in 1-second pulses, till the mixture resembles fairly fine crumbs.

Transfer the crumbs to a plastic bag, and squeeze them together; if they don't hold together easily, add a bit more water. Form the dough into a flat ball, and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. *Or use your favorite single-crust pie crust recipe, or a prepared pie crust.

Roll the dough into a 13-inch round, and transfer it to a 12-inch flat pizza pan. Crimp the edges to form a rim around the edge of the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you're preparing the topping.

The Topping: In the bowl of a food processor equipped with the metal blade, combine the flour, maple sugar (or granulated sugar, if you're using it; hold the maple syrup aside), butter, cinnamon and nutmeg. Process until the mixture forms even crumbs. Add the walnuts and pulse a couple of times to distribute. You may also do this with an electric mixer, or by hand.

Assembly: Remove the crust from the refrigerator. Lay the apple slices, in concentric rings, close together atop the crust. Sprinkle the apples with a dash of salt and the lemon juice. If you're using maple syrup instead of maple sugar, drizzle the syrup atop the apples. Distribute the topping evenly over all.

Bake the pizza on the bottom shelf of a preheated 425F oven for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375F and continue to bake until the crust and topping are golden, about 30 minutes. Note: You may want to set the pizza pan on a larger pan, as (like all apple pies) this pizza tends to bubble over a bit. Yield: Eight generous or 12 average servings

This recipe was meant for people who like the taste of apple pie but not the sloppiness of the filling. This 'pizza' is really nothing more than a flat pie without the top crust. The result is apple-pie flavor without as much moisture. Plus, who doesn't like the idea of making a pizza for dessert? The maple and cheddar are only accents, not major parts of the flavor.

  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar -- packed
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2              large  apples -- peeled, cored, and
                        coarsely chopped

Preheat the oven to 450F. Grease and flour a 12 cup muffin tin and set aside.

Mix together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, and set aside. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and add the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of the brown sugar. Beat until fluffy. Add the egg and mix well. Mix in the buttermilk gently. (If you over-mix, the buttermilk will cause the mixture to curdle.) Stir in the dry ingredients and fold in the apple chunks.

Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, sprinkling the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar on top. Bake for 10 minutes, turn the heat down to 400F, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool the muffins for 5 minutes in the tin, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Yield: 12 muffins

These dark, moist muffins will keep well for several days. You don't even need to heat them up to enjoy them, which makes them a perfect after-school snack. The brown sugar sprinkled on top adds a crunchy touch, for all you muffin top lovers out there.

                             Applesauce Cake

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggs
     1/3           cup  molasses
  1 1/2           cups  applesauce
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose or
                        White Whole Wheat Flour
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, molasses and applesauce till smooth. Add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, soda, cinnamon and nutmeg; beat till smooth.

Pour the batter into a lightly greased and floured 9" x 13" baking pan. Place the cake in a preheated 375F oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until it tests done. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack. Just before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired. Yield: 24 pieces

Note: This cake is a good example of trying to push a recipe too far down the fat-free road. The original recipe calls for 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. Our first attempt at changing it was a disaster: We substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup nonfat yogurt for the two eggs, and ended up with a flat, raw oblong of applesauce-flavored goo, just about the consistency of clay. By putting the eggs back in and eliminating the yogurt, We were able to produce a "normal" cake. And the eggs added only half a gram of fat per serving (as well as 23 grams of cholesterol); We think that tiny extra bit of fat is well worth the final result.

This cake got the thumbs-up first from the ladies in customer service, then from the folks at our warehouse.

While testing recipes, we made sure to send lots of "samples" to our pickers and packers at our warehouse, and they gave this particular cake an approval rating of 100%. The molasses and applesauce help keep it moist, and also react with the baking soda to produce a nice rise. Our thanks to Mike Hrezik of Leesport, Pa. for the original recipe from which this almost-nonfat version was adapted.

                Fruit and Spice Breads          Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter -- cut into small
                pieces
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely minced crystallized ginger
     1/2           cup  diced glaceed apricots -- halved, or dried
                        apricots, cut into eight pieces each
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        Glaze:
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar

Preheat the oven to 425F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, ground ginger, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in the sugar, crystallized ginger and apricots with your hands to distribute all the ingredients evenly. Add the buttermilk gradually, mixing gently to form a soft dough.

Shape the dough into a ball and knead it briefly on a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough in half and pat each half into a 1/2-inch thick round, 5 inches in diameter. Cut each round into six triangles, and transfer the triangles to an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

Just before baking, brush the tops of the scones with 2 tablespoons of buttermilk and sprinkle them with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes (turning the baking sheet 180 halfway through the baking time), until the scones are a light golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 12 scones

Tender, light and neither too buttery nor too sweet, these breakfast scones feature sweet bursts of dried apricot followed by the mildly assertive nip of crystallized ginger (which can be omitted if you aren't a fan). With a pat of melting butter, a spoonful of apricot preserves or orange marmalade, and a tall glass of orange juice (or an aromatic cup of apricot tea), you've just found a few moments of morning serenity.

  3                     eggs
  1            package  dried apricots -- (6 ounce)
     1/3           cup  chopped pecans
  1                     slightly beaten egg white
  1             recipe  Apricot
                        Icing:
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1               tbsp  apricot nectar

In a large mixing bowl stir together 1-1/2 cups of the flour and the yeast. In a saucepan heat apricot nectar, margarine or butter, sugar, and salt till warm (120* to 130*), stirring constantly. Add to flour mixture along with eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.

Reserve 4 or 5 dried apricots; snip remaining apricots. Using a spoon, stir the snipped apricots and pecans into the dough. Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough (3 to 5 minutes total).Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once. Cover; let rise till double (about 1-1/2 hours).

Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Divide dough into 20 portions; shape into smooth balls. Arrange balls 2 inches apart on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise till almost double (30 to 45 minutes).

Brush dough with egg white. Bake in a 350* oven for 12 to 15 minutes or till golden. Cool on wire racks. Snip reserved apricots into 40 thin slivers. Using a spoon, top each bun with an X of Apricot Icing; decorate each X with 2 apricot slivers. Makes 20 rolls.

Apricot Icing: Combine 1 cup sifted powdered sugar and enough apricot nectar (about 1 tablespoon) to make an icing of drizzling consistency.

Make-Ahead Tip: Bake rolls as directed; cool thoroughly. Do not add Apricot Icing. Place in a freezer container or freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month. To serve, thaw, cov ered, over night in the refrigerator. Top with Apricot Icing and apricots.

                        Crust:
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- (1 stick) chilled
  3        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  5        tablespoons  ice water
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
                        Filling:
  4                     eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  shredded Cheddar cheese -- (2 ounces)
     1/4      teaspoon  oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
  10            stalks  fresh asparagus -- cleaned wood stems
                        removed
     1/2           cup  sliced mushrooms
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely ground black pepper -- or to taste

Crust: In a medium sized bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the butter and shortening, mixing quickly and lightly with a pastry knife, a mixer or your fingers until the mixture is crumbly. Make a well in the center of the pastry, and add the water, egg yolk and vinegar. Mix until the dough just holds together, adding an additional tablespoon of water only if necessary; the more water you use, the tougher your crust will be.

Pat the dough into a 10 or 11-inch removable-bottom tart pan. Prick it all over with a fork. Bake it in a preheated 350F oven for 10 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and let cool.

Filling: In a medium- sized bowl, beat together the eggs and milk, then stir in the cheese, oregano and thyme. Slice six of the asparagus stalks, on the diagonal, into 3/4-inch pieces. Stir the sliced asparagus, mushrooms, and salt and pepper into the egg mixture.

Pour the filling into the crust. Place the remaining 5 stalks of asparagus in a fan pattern on top of the filling.

Bake the tart in a preheated 350F oven for about 30 minutes, or until it's set. Remove the tart from the oven, and cool to lukewarm before removing the bottom. Yield 1 tart, 12 servings

This recipe makes a unique appetizer or side dish.

Bake cheesecake in a preheated 325F oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature.

Arrange fruit in a single layer on top of cooled cheesecake. Stir jelly in a small saucepan over medium heat until liquefied. Drizzle jelly over berries, or brush over peach slices. Refrigerate cake until ready to serve.

The following cake is a specialty of Betty McKearney of Vincentown, N.J. Betty foregoes the usual graham cracker crumb crust in favor of a buttery flour crust, and her rich cheese filling takes a full pound and a half of cream cheese. This cake is not for the faint-hearted!

                         Avoiding Holes In Bread

                        *****

One major cause of tunnels or large holes in bread is a hot dough which was
allowed to age excessively.  Excessive yeast in the dough will  also cause
the dough to age excessively. Someone said overproofing will also cause
that problem which is true..

A bread dough should come out of the mixer between 78-82F. to produce bread
with the best interior qualities and aroma and taste.  The most desirable
acids (Mainly Acedic Acid and a small amount of Lactic Acid plus Ethyl
Alcohol) are produced in the range of 78 and 90F.  There are chemical changes
constantly taking place in a fermenting dough.  Even though 90 degree F.and
above are a little high while in the proof box, it won't remain at that
temperature long enough to effect the flavor and other loaf
characteristics.  The unique Bread Flavors are produced when Ethyl Alcohol
and Lactic Acid and other acids react chemically together to form Esters.

The undesirable flavors produced at high temperatures are Lactic Acid and
Butyric Acid plus many other types of acids all of which produce strong
odors and sour taste.  Bakers who produce French Breads and Rye Breads mix
their doughs even lower than those mentioned above and allow the dough to
ferment slowly for a day or in some cases 2 or 3 days.  The cooler the
dough and the longer the fermentation period, the better the taste and flavor.

     1/4           Cup  Dark Rum
     2/3           Cup  Unsweetened Whipped Cream

FINALLY found the answer to your question about "Babka" recipe for ABM!

In "The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever" by Madge Rosenberg there is the recipe you are looking for! "Save this giant baba for a special celebration that calls for an impressive dessert that is syrupy and rich."

1. Scald the milk in a small sauce pan and let cool to room temperature.

2. Add the milk and all remaining ingred. for the baba in the order SUGGESTED by YOUR bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.

3. Make a syrup by boiling the sugar & water together in a small saucepan until the mixture is clear. Add the rum and simmer for 1 minute.

4. When the bread cycle ends, remove the warm baba to a deep dish or shallow bowl. Brush the baba with the syrup several times as it cools. Allow the baba to soak up the syrup that collects in the bottom of the dish. Refrigerate until chilled.

5. When cool, slice the baba into wedges and brush them with any remaining syrup if they are not totally moist. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream on the side.

I copied the recipe just AS IS from the book. I have not made it. The "2/3 C whipped cream 1 cup" was written just that way. It probably means it is 2/3 C. before whipping and 1 cup after whipping.

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4           cup  cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cumin
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  cooked corn kernels
  6             ounces  bacon -- cooked and crumbled
  1                cup  grated Cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 40F. Grease an 8-inch-square pan.

Put the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and cumin in a bowl, and stir with a whisk until well mixed. Mix the egg, milk, and vegetable oil and add to the dry ingredients. Stir in the corn, bacon and cheese.

Spread batter into pan and bake 30 minutes, or until browned and a cake tester inserted comes out clean. Yield: One eight-inch pan of bread

This recipe uses the spice cumin, a toasty spice usually seen in chili recipes. It isn't hot at all. If you don't like cumin, you can leave it out. When I was testing this recipe, I went to buy corn at the local farm stand. Due to our cold summer, there was no corn! So we know that frozen corn works just as well. Meanwhile, this will get to you right as the corn crop is ripening.

                Hand Made

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  1         tablespoon  instant yeast
  4               cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  non-diastatic malt powder
  1 1/2           cups  water -- lukewarm
                        Water Bath:
  2             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  non-diastatic malt powder
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar

Manual/Mixer Method: To make this dough by hand or in a mixer, combine all of the ingredients and knead vigorously, by hand for 10 to 15 minutes, or by machine on medium-low speed for about 10 minutes. Since we're using a high-protein bread flour here, it takes a bit more effort and time to develop the gluten. The dough will be quite stiff; if you're using an electric mixer it will "thwap" the sides of the bowl, and hold its shape (without spreading at all) when you stop the mixer. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and set it aside to rise till noticeably puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients in the pan of the machine, program the machine for Dough or Manual, and press Start. Check the dough after 10 minutes; it should be quite stiff, and won't have formed a smooth ball. The dough will feel quite firm when you poke your finger into it. Allow the machine to complete its cycle, then complete bagels as instructed below.

Transfer the dough to a work surface, and divide it into eight pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll it into a smooth, round ball. Cover the balls with plastic wrap, and let them rest for 30 minutes. They'll puff up very slightly.

While the dough is resting, prepare the water bath by heating the water, malt and sugar to a very gentle boil in a large, wide-diameter pan. Preheat your oven to 425F.

Use your index finger to poke a hole through the center of each ball, then twirl the dough on your finger to stretch the hole till it's about 2 inches in diameter (the entire bagel will be about 4 inches across). Place each bagel on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

Transfer the bagels, four at a time if possible, to the simmering water. Increase the heat under the pan to bring the water back up to a gently simmering boil, if necessary. Cook the bagels for 2 minutes, flip them over, and cook 1 minute more. Using a skimmer or strainer, remove the bagels from the water and place them back on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining bagels.

Bake the bagels for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're as deep a brown as you like, turning them over about 15 minutes into the baking time (this will help them remain tall and round). Remove the bagels from the oven, and cool completely on a wire rack. Yield: 8 bagels

Variations
To make sesame seed or poppy seed (or other seed) bagels, brush each bagel, just before baking, with a glaze made of 1 egg white beaten till frothy with 1 tablespoon of water. Glaze each bagel, and sprinkle heavily with seeds.

To make onion-topped bagels, bake bagels for 20 to 22 minutes (or until they're almost as brown as you like), and remove the pan from the oven, keeping the oven turned on. Working with one bagel at a time, glaze as instructed above, and sprinkle with minced, dried onion. Return the bagels to the oven for no more than 2 minutes (the onions will burn if the bagels are left in longer than that).

Want to make cinnamon-raisin bagels? Knead about 2/3 cup of raisins into the dough towards the end of the kneading process. Just before you're done kneading, sprinkle your work surface heavily with cinnamon-sugar, and give the dough a few more turns; it'll pick up the cinnamon-sugar in irregular swirls. Divide the dough into eight pieces, form each piece into a ball, and roll each ball in additional cinnamon-sugar. Proceed to let rest and shape as directed above.

We've seen bagel-store bagels in varieties as diverse as jalapeno pepper, spinach and cheese, and marbled rye. You can make bagels with just about any kind of bread dough. To retain the characteristic chewy texture, just be sure to make a dough that's low in fat, and follow the shaping, rising, boiling and baking techniques.

These days, every corner luncheonette seems to have a ready supply of top-flight bagels, as do shops that are devoted exclusively to bagels, their accompanying spreads, and sandwiches made there from. So, with all kinds of good bagels available just about wherever you turn, why make your own? First, so you know what's in 'em; who wants azodicarbonmide in their pumpernickel bagel? Second, so you can customize them to taste, as in pesto bagels with sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts; and third, it's fairly easy, and fun! If you can make bread dough, you can easily make bagels.

                Fruit and Spice Breads          Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  mashed very ripe bananas
                        (the riper the banana, the better the
                        flavor), about 4 medium bananas
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil or canola oil
  1                cup  bran cereal (not bran flakes)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
                        grated rind of 1 orange -- or 1/4 teaspoon
                        orange oil
     1/4           cup  nonfat yogurt -- plain or flavored
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar

In a large mixing bowl, beat together till smooth the banana, egg, vegetable oil, bran cereal, vanilla, orange peel or oil and yogurt. Set aside.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. Quickly and gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring only until everything is moistened. Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pan.*

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the cake tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool for 5 minutes on a wire rack. Remove the bread from the pan, and cool completely before slicing. Yield: 16 servings

*Note that this isn't the usual 9 x 5-inch pan called for in quick bread recipes. You may use a 9 x 5-inch pan, but the resulting loaf will be flatter, and will cook a bit more quickly.

While not officially qualifying as low-fat (3g fat or less per serving), this bread is certainly a lower-fat version of the banana bread you might be used to preparing.

NOTES : This is a fantastic bread...moist and chewy with a crisp crust. I have included the original ABM recipe even though I made the loaves by hand. (Don't worry...I read the archived lists and will NOT offer any opinions on ABM vs. by hand!!!!) These are the changes I made: doubled all ingredients except oil. Used 1 T (not a typo) canola. Instead of all-purpose flour--used 1/2 King Arthur Special for Machines and 1/2 King Arthur White Whole Wheat. Baked at 375F for 45 min in two 9x5 pans. Bread gets very brown; covered with foil after 25 minutes.

  1              Large  or Small* Machine
  1                cup  water -- warm
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose or

  2          teaspoons  salt
  5          teaspoons  Italian seasoning -- heaping
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast

Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine. Program for Dough or Manual, and press Start.

*If you're using a small (1-pound) bread machine, remove the dough from the machine at the end of the second kneading cycle, and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

At the end of the cycle, remove the dough from the machine and punch it down. Roll it out to form a rectangle, and transfer it to a cookie sheet, 10 x 15-inch to 12 x 18-inch. Pat the dough into the pan. Make indentations in the dough with your fingertips, about an inch apart, and drizzle sparingly with olive oil.

A plain focaccia can be topped with a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. Other toppings may include browned onions, fresh garlic, goat cheese, pesto, fresh sage and bacon, potatoes and rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, Gorgonzola cheese, olives, or any combination of those or other ingredients of your choice.

Let the focaccia rise for half an hour to an hour. This will make a lighter bread. Bake the focaccia in the preheated 450F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and serve. Serves 6 to 10

The predecessor of Pizza in Italy was a flat bread called "Focaccia" which is used both as an appetizer (an antipasto, the course before the pasta) or as an accompaniment to a main meal.

        Basic Sandwich Bread And/or Devonshire (Or Cornish) Splits

                Hand Made                       White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  water
     1/4           cup  nonfat dry milk
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
  4 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/4           cup  softened butter or shortening

This amount of dough is easily prepared in a 1 1/2-pound bread machine set on the dough cycle. If you have no such assistance, beat together the water, dry milk, and egg in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. Add 3 cups of the flour and mix together until you have a slack dough. Add the butter or shortening and finally the remaining flour, mixing until you have a soft but quite workable dough.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured kneading surface and knead for 3 or 4 minutes. Give the dough a rest while you clean out and grease your bowl. Knead for a further 3 or 4 minutes, shape the dough into a nice ball, put it into the bowl, and turn it over so the top has a thin film of grease on it. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Knock the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. If you have a scale, it'll makes the next step a bit more scientific. If you're opting to make one loaf and six splits, take about two-thirds of the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pan. Take the remaining dough and cut it into six even pieces, shape them into balls, and place them, seam-side down, on a small, lightly greased baking sheet. Cover the loaf and rolls and let the loaf rise for 45 minutes to an hour, while the rolls should rise for 15 to 20 minutes.

Bake the rolls for about 15 minutes at 425F. Remove them from the oven and place them on a rack to cool. Turn the oven down to 350F and when the bread dough has risen just over the top edge of the bread pan, put it in the oven and bake it for 35 minutes. Remove it and cool it on a rack.

Cornish Splits
Cut each roll from top to bottom on the diagonal, not quite all the way through. Open each one up; on one side spread strawberry jam, and on the other, clotted or double cream (or even homemade sour cream, which is much like a light clotted cream). Close the roll back up and, if you feel like being elegant, brush the top with a little melted butter and sprinkle on a bit of confectioners' sugar. If you serve these rolls with clotted cream and treacle (very similar to molasses) rather than clotted cream and jam, they're known as "Thunder and Lightning.

This is a rich and basic recipe that makes enough dough for one 4 x 13-inch pain de mie pan; one 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan plus a half dozen Devonshire Splits; or a dozen and a half Devonshire Splits. Splits are the rolls served in the West Country with strawberry jam and double cream at a traditional "Cream Tea." The difference between the Devonshire and Cornish Split is the Tamar River, and which side of it you happen to be on.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  water
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- (1/2 stick)
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  4          teaspoons  special instant yeast
                        Glaze:
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  heavy cream

Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for the dough or manual cycle, and press start.

Check the dough with about 10 minutes remaining in the final kneading cycle, and adjust the consistency by adding flour or water as needed; the dough should be fairly sticky and slack. When the machine has completed its cycle, remove the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.

Grease a 9 x 13-inch pan. Press the dough into the prepared pan with your fingers, stretching it to cover the bottom of the pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise until it's doubled in bulk, 30 to 45 minutes. With two fingers, punch deep holes all over the dough. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle it over the dough. Drizzle the cream evenly on top.

Bake the cake in a preheated 350F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven, and serve it warm from the pan. Yield: 12 servings

The following cinnamon-y, velvety yeast "cake" is drizzled with cream and sugar before baking - fattening but yummy. This cake isn't cloyingly sweet, but is very tender. Serve it with coffee, at breakfast or as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon pick-me-up.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- (1 stick)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1                     egg
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1              quart  berries
  2               cups  sour cream -- (1 pint)
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, butter or margarine, baking powder, egg and vanilla. Beat till combined; the mixture will be very stiff, and you may need to knead it together by hand at the very end.

Lightly grease a 10" springform or removable-bottom pan. Pat the dough into the bottom of the pan, and spread the berries over the dough.

In a small bowl, beat together the sour cream, egg, sugar and vanilla. Spread this mixture atop the berries.

Place the pan in a preheated 350F oven and bake the cake for 1 hour, or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove the cake from the oven and cool to room temperature. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to serve. Yield: 16 servings

This impressive-looking cake can be made with blueberries, raspberries, black raspberries, wild strawberries -- just about any kind of berry you go out and pick on a sunny summer afternoon.

Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                Food Processor                  Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  4        tablespoons  cold butter
     1/4           cup  cold shortening
     1/2           cup  milk -- cream or half and
                        half*
  1                     egg

*You can use any kind of milk, from skim right up through whipping cream. The richer the milk, the richer and more tender your biscuit will be.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder. Cut the butter into pats, and work the butter and shortening into the flour, using a pastry blender, mixer (you can also use a food processor, up to this point), or your fingers. When thoroughly combined, the mixture should resemble uneven, coarse crumbs; don't keep working it till it's perfectly homogeneous. The point is to work the cold fat into the dry ingredients fairly evenly, but so that it still retains its integrity; you don't want the fat to become one with the flour. The uneven, tender texture of biscuits comes from pockets of cold fat in the dough, which in the baking process don't melt till after the dough is set, leaving butter-catching fissures in the baked biscuit.

Measure the milk or cream into a liquid measuring cup, add the egg, and whisk till smooth. Add this to the flour/fat mixture, and stir just to combine; as soon as you no longer see areas that are very obviously wetter than other areas, stop mixing and dump the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead it a couple of times to bring it together, if necessary; remember, every time you push, pat or shape the dough from now on, you're toughening the gluten, and therefore the biscuit, so try to handle it as little as possible. With the help of a dough scraper, shape the dough into a 6 x 6-inch square, about 3/4 inch thick. Run a rolling pin over the top once to even it out. Wrap it in plastic wrap, and place it in the freezer for 1 hour.

Remove the dough from the freezer, unwrap it, and set it on a work surface. It'll be very stiff, but still soft enough to cut with a sharp knife, sharpened dough scraper or rolling cutter (pizza cutter). Cut the dough into nine 2-inch squares, and place the squares on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Make sure to cut out the biscuits with something sharp; if you use a dull knife, you compress the biscuits' edges, and they won't rise as high.

Bake the biscuits in a preheated 400F oven for 16 minutes, or until they're a light, golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and serve hot, warm or at room temperature. Yield: 9 fairly large biscuits

Ah, biscuits -- what could be more simple? Unfortunately, for me, it's more like "How many different variations of a tough, flat, tasteless biscuit can I produce?" The word biscuit comes from the French biscuit, which referred to seamen's bread, i.e., hardtack -- you know, that tooth-breaking stuff that stays "fresh" for years in a ship's galley. And tooth-breaking is just what some of my past attempts at biscuits have been; or, if not exactly tooth-breaking, jaw-aching and baking-powder tasting. Yuck! It's enough to send me right back to yeast rolls which, to me, are much easier to produce than baking powder biscuits.

One of my favorite diner breakfasts has always been (well, at least since I turned into an adult and my tastebuds mellowed) sausage gravy and biscuits. Sausage gravy is breakfast sausage, cooked and crumbled, then stirred into a white sauce made of flour, sausage grease and milk.

The recipe you see below is one that combines the best attributes of all of those ingredients to make a biscuit that is rich and tender, yet strong enough to stand up to gravy without turning to mush. If you don't want to use them as a base for sauce, they're also strong-yet-tender enough to be smeared with softened butter and spread with jam. And, come summer, they're just right for strawberry shortcake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        The Sponge:
  1 1/3           cups  whole buckwheat flour
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  non-instant dry milk or 1/3 cup instant
                        dry milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast
                        The Batter:
  2                     eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  melted butter

For the sponge: Mix the ingredients together in a medium-sized mixing bowl, cover, and set aside.

For the batter: Beat the egg yolks until light, then beat in the milk, sugar and salt. Blend this mixture into the sponge, and let it rest for 30 to 45 minutes. Set aside the egg whites and let them warm to room temperature. While you're waiting, you can get together the things you want to serve with the blini. We suggest any (or all!) of the following: melted butter, sour cream, caviar, thinly sliced smoked salmon, pickled herring, kippers, chopped onion or scallions, chopped hard-boiled egg, capers or, for something sweet, jam!

Just before you're ready to cook the blini, beat the egg whites until they form peaks, and fold them into the remaining batter. Whisk in the melted butter.

Use a heavy, well-seasoned cast-iron griddle, if you have one. If not, use any heavy frying pan or griddle. Heat the pan over low to medium heat and wipe it with butter. (You shouldn't need to grease the pan again once you start cooking.)

Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons batter onto the griddle for each blini. They should be about 4 inches in diameter. Cook them as you would pastry flour. Add enough of the bread flour to form a cohesive dough, and knead the dough till it's smooth and supple, adding additional flour as needed. Cover the dough, and allow it to rise for 1 hour; it won't rise very much, if at all. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for manual or dough, and press Start. When the machine has completed its cycle, transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface.

Divide the dough into eight pieces. Round each piece into a ball, then flatten each ball slightly. Place the balls on a lightly greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet, cover them with plastic wrap, and allow them to rest for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Again, they won't rise much; that's OK.

About 10 minutes before the end of the rising time, heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or in a deep saucepan. If you're using a deep fryer, pancakes, until bubbles appear that break and don't fill in. Flip over and cook until lightly browned. These can be stacked on a warm plate in a warm oven until serving. Yield: about 2 dozen 4-inch blini

The following are pancakes of another feather. These are Russian, and were (it's no longer officially recognized) eaten at the revelrous pre-Lenten feast known as Maslenitsa, or "butter week," from the Russian word maslo, butter. Along with eating blini, the Russians threw themselves into this festival with great exuberance. Many of the traditions associated with this time date back to pre-Christian revelry when they were, as we say in New England, trying to "break the back of winter." They'd build great ice hills upon which they'd haul effigies of winter, which were then sent crashing down the slopes. Huge bonfires were built to drive winter away. They even wrapped themselves in animal skins and made fearful noises to scare away evil spirits.

Although all of this can be traced back to superstition about the sun and the passing seasons, most of it became an excuse to break up the long, dark winter days with some fun. What the Russians loved best during Maslenitsa was eating blini, which they did with great abandon before the beginning of the Lenten fast. No meat was allowed during this week, thus the relish with which they consumed dairy products and fish. Blini batter needs to ripen all day or overnight, so plan ahead when preparing it.

While cake cools, make filling. Using a chilled bowl and chilled beaters, whip heavy cream until thick. Add sugar, and continue to beat until stiff. Gently stir in raspberries.

Place one cake layer on a plate. Spread with filling. Top with the other cake layer. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

In this country, a torte usually refers to a rich, moist cake of several thin layers with jam, pastry cream or whipped cream in between the layers. Blitz Torte, a popular German torte, calls for a moist, dense yellow cake to be topped with meringue, cinnamon sugar and almonds, and filled with custard. In this Americanized version, the torte is filled not with custard, but with raspberries bound with whipped cream. The combination - almonds, cinnamon, raspberries, whipped cream and cake - is superb. This cake is an impressive end to a celebratory meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2-pound Loaf:
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  blueberries -- fresh or frozen
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  salt
     2/3           cup  wheat bran
     2/3           cup  King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour
  2 2/3           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast

Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Basic white bread, and press Start.

Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water. Yield: one 7- to 8-inch loaf

This bread is perfect for a lazy summer morning. It has a distinct blueberry flavor and cake-like texture. The bran and wheat flour add flavor and fiber. Substitute raspberries for the blueberries if desired. Either berry will color the bread in vivid hues, either purple or pink.

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Topping:
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- (1/2 stick)
                        Batter:
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- (1/2 stick)
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  milk
  2               cups  fresh or frozen blueberries -- well drained

First: Preheat your oven to 375F.

Making the Topping: Mix the sugar, flour and cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut or rub in the butter or margarine with the side of a fork, two knives or your finger tips until it reaches a crumbly state. Set aside.

Making the Batter: Blend the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium sized mixing bowl. In a large bowl cream together the sugar, butter or margarine, egg and vanilla. Alternately add the milk and the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, ending with flour. Stir only enough to blend. Fold in the blueberries.

Assembling & Baking: Pour the batter into a well-greased and floured, 9-inch cake pan. Sprinkle the topping over the batter and bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until a cake tester or knife comes out clean.

Let the buckle cool for 10 minutes. Loosen the sides with a knife or spatula. Holding the cake pan in your left hand, gently tip the cake out onto your right hand, remove the pan, and gently right the cake onto a serving dish.

When you get tired of making the pies, jams, this is an easy and fresh way to put those summer blueberries to use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  vegetable shortening
  2 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  3                     eggs
     3/4           cup  sour milk* -- buttermilk or yogurt
  3 1/4           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  blueberries -- fresh or frozen

*Sour milk is easily prepared by stirring 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice into 1 cup of milk, then waiting 5 minutes; the milk will "clabber" (look curdled).

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening till smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the milk, buttermilk or yogurt, beating till well-blended.

Sift together the flour, soda and salt, and add to the wet ingredients. Mix well, and stir in the blueberries.

Turn the batter into a greased and floured 9 x 13-inch pan. Bake the cake in a preheated 350F oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until it tests done. Remove the cake from the oven, and cool it on a wire rack. Yield: 24 servings

This moist cake, dense with blueberries, forms a lovely crackly-sugary top as it bakes. It's reminiscent of blueberry streusel coffeecake.

  1                cup  sugar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Crust:
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  pecans -- chopped fine
                        Filling:
  6             ounces  cream cheese -- (6 to 8)
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  heavy cream or milk
                        Topping:
  1 1/2         quarts  blueberries -- (6 cups) divided
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch

For Crust: Combine flour, sugar, and pecans. Cut in butter or margarine until mixture is crumbly. Pat onto the bottom and partway up the sides of a 9 1/2-inch removable-bottom tart pan. Bake in a preheated 325F oven for 15 minutes, until browned. Remove from oven and cool.

For Filling: Cream sugar, milk and cream cheese until smooth. Spread onto cooled crust.

For Topping: Mix sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan. Add water slowly, stirring to keep mixture smooth. Add 1 cup mashed blueberries and bring to a boil over medium- high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring constantly, until thick -- 1 to 2 minutes. Cool to warm.

Arrange remaining blueberries on top of cream cheese layer in crust. Spoon thickened glaze over berries. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, preferably 3 hours. Remove tart from pan by lifting it out, keeping it on the removable bottom.

Tarts are very similar to pies; the main difference between the two is that tarts are generally wider, shallower and don't have a top crust. Tarts are also known as flans -- except in Spain, where a flan is a baked custard

Fresh fruit tarts and fresh fruit pies differ most in their preparation. Fruit pies include fresh, uncooked fruit, spooned into an unbaked crust, and the whole baked together. Tarts are usually a crust which has been prebaked, then topped with a prettily arranged layer of fresh, uncooked (or just slightly cooked) fruit. Often a pastry cream or cream cheese layer will underlie the fruit, giving the tart a cheesecake-like texture and flavor.

This tart comes from another King Arthur Flour friend. It combines three tart-like elements: fresh fruit; a cream cheese layer, and slightly cooked fruit. It's somewhat reminiscent of the "uncooked" fruit pies which made the rounds several years ago, pies which contained a layer of fresh fruit topped with a layer of semi-cooked fruit. These pies -- and this tart -- combine the texture and flavor of fresh berries, and the juicy sweetness of barely cooked berries: the best of both worlds!

                        Fruit:
  2              pints  fresh blueberries
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  quick-cooking tapioca
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon extract
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
                        Topping:
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  whole cornmeal
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- (1 stick)
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
  1                     egg

                        Glaze:
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup

Combine blueberries, sugar, maple syrup, tapioca, lemon extract, cinnamon and nutmeg in an ungreased 10-inch spider (cast iron skillet) or a shallow 11-inch quiche or tart dish.

Mix flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Cream butter with confectioners' sugar, then beat in egg and buttermilk. Add dry ingredients and mix well. Pour batter over berries in pan.

Bake cobbler in a preheated 375F oven 35 to 40 minutes, until berries are bubbling and cornbread is lightly browned and feels done when you touch it. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter, mix with 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and brush glaze atop the hot cobbler. Put cobbler under broiler for about 1 minute, or until the top is glazed. Serve warm with ice cream or whipped cream.

The blueberries, maple and corn give this cobbler a distinctly New England flavor.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix till just combined; there's no need to beat the batter.

Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan, and cover it with buttered aluminum foil, fastening the foil tight to the edges of the pan (so the bread will steam a bit), but ballooning it in the center, so the bread has room to expand without hitting the foil.

Bake the bread in a preheated 325F oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil (the middle may be slightly sunken; that's OK), and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Yield: 1 loaf, about 16 servings

And you thought it only came out of a can, right? Boston brown bread is actually a mixture of rye and wheat flours and cornmeal, sweetened with molasses, moistened with buttermilk, and steamed in a coffee can or steamer for hours atop the stove.

But I was willing to bet this bread could be baked as well as steamed. So I fooled around with the ingredients in several recipes -- all remarkably the same, by the way -- until I had something that would fit into a standard loaf pan. Then, to somewhat imitate the steaming process, I covered the top with aluminum foil. After an hour in the oven, I peeled off the foil to reveal -- brown bread! I hope you enjoy the results as much as I did. -- P.J.H.

  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
     1/3           cup  honey
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  brandy (apple brandy is good)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  peeled -- chopped tart apples
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
                        Topping:
  6        tablespoons  brown sugar -- firmly packed
  6        tablespoons  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  3        tablespoons  butter

In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat together egg, honey, milk, brandy, and vegetable oil. Gently stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients, being careful not to over stir. Then fold in apples and walnuts.

Make the topping. In a small bowl, mix sugar, flour and butter together till crumbly. Set aside.

Spoon muffin batter into 12 greased muffin tins. Sprinkle each muffin with a heaping tablespoon of topping. Bake muffins in a preheated 375F oven until they're golden brown and test done, about 25 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.

The brandy adds "spirited" flavor, but the actual alcohol evaporates during baking.
Just A Hint...
If you're trying to avoid alcohol, but don't want to leave the brandy out of the recipe, fear not; during baking, the alcohol evaporates, leaving just the spirited flavor.

                        *****

The last information I learned  was while studying at Giuliano Bugialli's cooking school in Italy.  It was  using a sponge.

I've found that making a sponge first, then adding it to the rest of the flour always gives me consistent results as far as the texture and taste of the bread. The method incorporates a tip that Bugialli gave us about being able to tell when the sponge had "doubled" in bulk. He had us sprinkle a light coating of flour (about 1/8 cup) over the sponge and cover it with a dry towel. When the coating of flour had separated into "little islands," the sponge was ready to add to the flour and mix.

Another trick I use was learned from reading an article about a bread baker in France. I used to use 1 cup of warm water for the yeast mixture. I now use 1/2 cup warm water and 1/2 cup of beer. The beer aids in the rising and you don't taste it at all in the final product.

                        -- 1 1/2-lb. loaf:
     1/2           cup  milk
  3                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  3 1/2           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
     3/4           cup  raisins (use half golden raisins if
                        desired)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast

Place all of the ingredients, except the raisins, into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Sweet Bread or Raisin Bread (or whole grain, or basic white bread, if your machine has neither of those cycles), and press Start. If you've programmed your machine for the raisin bread cycle, add the raisins at the beep. If your machine is programmed for some other cycle, add the raisins about 5 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle.

Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, a bit soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water. Yield: one 7- to 8-inch loaf

The following recipe was an award-winner at King Arthur Flour's 1993 WinterBake competition. A tall riser, it's a tender and toothsome ode to spices and raisins.

Madeleine's Notes:
Note that three glass bowls will be needed.  I have chosen this recipe because it involves all the steps of rich bread baking from the chef through to the baked product without taking days to prepare. For the preparation of this bread, I am using the techniques explained in great detail on pages 241-243 of "Le Ricette Regionali Italiane", by Maria Gosetti della Salda, Milan, Italy, 1967.  The amount and choice of ingredients were recommended by my Milan-born cousin Bruno Asnaghi.  I have adapted the proportions to American unbleached all-purpose flour.  The cake flour in the recipe is used exclusively to coat the raisins and citron and prevent them from falling to the bottom of the bread.

Best freezing stage: Fully baked

Yield:  3 rich cakelike breads each to be baked in one 1-quart tall pyrex glass bowl, for a total of 24 servings.

Make the chef:  Mix the flour, yeast, and water together in a medium-size bowl until homogeneous.  Cover with a piece of cheesecloth and let ferment and rise 3 full hours at room temperature in the warmest corner of the kitchen.

Make the levain:  In a large bowl mix together the flour and sugar.  Make a well in the center of the flour and to it add the chef; gradually blend the chef into the flour, adding also water as needed until the levain is homogeneous.  Cover with the same cheesecloth and let ferment and rise overnight in a cooler corner of the kitchen.

Make the intermediate dough:  Put the egg yolks and the whole egg in a large bowl.  Beat them into a thick omelette batter, then stir in the sugar and whisk until the mixture turns semithick and foamy (no need to reach the ribbon stage, though). Make a well in the flour and salt mixed together, gradually add the beaten eggs, them the levain, using a wooden spatula and lifting the dough to aerate it at the same time.  Continue beating gently as you introduce the melted, barely lukewarm butter into the dough.  When the dough is homogeneous, cover it with the cheesecloth and let it rise at room temperature in the warmest corner of the kitchen until doubled in bulk.  Gently punch the dough down and let it rise again to the highest volume it will go, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Make the final dough:  While the intermediate dough rises, soak the raisins and citron in the mixed orange flower water and Marsala.  Cover and let soak until the intermediate dough has risen for the second time.  Drain the fruit from the flavorings keeping any liquid left at the bottom of the bowl; pat the fruit dry, toss it into the cake flour to coat well, and set aside. Cream the 3/4 cup butter with the tips of your fingers and divide it into four equal parts.  Set aside at room temperature. Make a well in the remaining flour, mix in the salt, fruit, and the ground flavorings; add the already risen dough to the center of the well together with any remaining liquid flavorings.  Gradually bring the dry flour into the intermediate dough.  As soon as all the flour has been incorporated, put one part of the butter at the four poles of the dough; using your fingertips, cream each quarter of the butter into one quarter of the dough.  Beat with a few strokes of the hand, then return to a large clean bowl and let rise another 1 1/2 hours.  Punch the dough gently down and aerate it with a few slaps of the hand, but do not knead it. Butter each glass bowl with 1 tablespoon each of the remaining butter and line its bottom with a circle of parchment paper.  Add one third of the dough to each bowl.  Let proof until the dough reaches about 1/3 inch above the rim of each bowl, 40 to 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400F while the cakes are proofing.  Using a razor blade dipped in flour, cut a semicircular line 1/6 inch deep into the top of each cake.  Put the cakes to bake 20 minutes on the middle rack of the oven.  Turn the oven down to 325F and continue baking another 20 minutes.  Turn the oven off and let the cakes finish cooking in the dying oven another 5 to 10 minutes.  The cakes are done when a metal skewer inserted at the center of each comes out dry and burning to the top of the hand.  Remove from the oven, unmold on a cake rack, and cool completely. Wrap the cakes in aluminum foil and store 2 days in a breadbox before serving.  Serve lightly dusted with confectioners' sugar.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads     Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           Cups  fine or medium bulgur
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  2               Cups  boiling water
     1/2           Cup  minced onion
                        Approximately 2 cups unbleached hard white
                        or all-purpose flour

The dough for this cracker-like unyeasted flatbread is easily mixed in the food processor. The breads have a wonderful aroma as they bake and a satisfying savory taste, for the dough is made of full-grain bulgur, with only a little flour, and flavored with minced onion. The breads bake quickly in the oven. Bulgur breads go wonderfully with cheese, or strong flavors. Leave them to dry out and use as crackers, or wrap in a cloth to keep chewy and supple.

You will need a medium-sized bowl, a food processor (optional), unglazed quarry tiles to fit on the bottom rack of your oven, and a rolling pin. Place the bulgur and salt in a food processor, pour the boiling water over, and stir or process briefly to mix. Let stand for thirty minutes. When you come back to the bulgur mixture, it will look like the bulgur has totally absorbed the water. However, proceed by adding 1 cup flour and the minced onion, and process for 1 minute. The dough should come together into a large ball as you process. If it doesn=t, feel the dough: If it feels dry and floury, start the processor, add 2 tablespoons warm water and process for 30 seconds; again if the bulgur and flour still don't come together, add another 2 tablespoons water and process. Once a ball of dough forms, process for 2 to 3 minutes longer, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. (If your processor is too small to handle the whole dough, work with half at a time, adding 1/2 cup flour to each portion, then combine when you turn out of the processor and knead by hand). Knead by hand for 4 to 5 minutes.

Alternatively, if you do not have a food processor, combine bulgur, salt and boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let stand for 30 minutes. Add onions and 1/2 cup flour and stir in. Add another 1/2 cup flour and use your hands to fold flour into the dough. With a little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat sticky) that you can knead. Turn out onto a well-floured kneading surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes. Dough will be sticky at first, but will soon come together into a smooth workable dough; you may be surprised to discover how kneadable bulgur is. When finished kneading, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand until you are ready to proceed further, for 15 minutes to an hour, whatever is convenient.

To bake, have your oven preheated to 450 degrees with baking stone or quarry tiles in place on a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, and flatten each on a well-floured bread board. With a rolling pin, roll out one or two breads until very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Work with only one or two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven. When ready, handle the bread gently as you place it on the hot tiles. (You can also try dusting a peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour and using peel or sheet to transfer breads to hot tiles.) Bake on one side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The bread should begin to brown around the outside. When baked, keep breads warm by stacking them one on top of the other and wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel. Serve warm.

Yield: 8 thin, supple and slightly chewy flatbreads between 8 and 10 inches in diameter.

  1                cup  butterscotch chips -- (6 ounces)

*Toast pecans by placing them in a single layer on an ungreased pan and baking them in a preheated 350F oven for 7 to 9 minutes, or until they smell "toasty" and are beginning to brown.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, shortening and sugar, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl midway through. Beat in the vanilla, baking powder and salt. Mix in the flour, 1 cup at a time, till you have a cohesive, well-blended dough. Add the nuts and butterscotch chips, mixing till they're well-distributed throughout the dough.

Transfer the dough to a work surface (we don't bother to flour the surface; the dough is sticky, but is easily scraped up with a bench knife or dough scraper). Divide it into three fairly equal pieces, and shape each piece into a rough 10-inch log. Transfer each log to a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet, leaving about 3 inches between each log; you may need to use two baking sheets. Wet your fingers, and pat the logs into smooth-topped rectangles 10 inches long x 2 1/2 inches wide x 7/8 inch thick.

Bake the logs in a preheated 375F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're beginning to brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool for 30 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 300F.

Gently transfer the logs to a cutting surface, and use a serrated knife to cut them on the diagonal into 1/2-inch wide slices. Because of the nuts and the nature of the dough, the biscotti at this point are prone to crumbling; just be sure to use a slow, gentle sawing motion, and accept the fact that some bits and pieces will break off. (It's the privilege of the cook to eat these warm, tasty bits and pieces as they're created.) Carefully transfer the slices, cut sides up (and down) to a parchment-lined (makes cleanup easier) or ungreased baking sheet. You can crowd them together, as they won't expand further; about 1/4-inch breathing space is all that's required.

Return the biscotti to the 300F oven, and bake them for 20 minutes. Remove them from the oven, quickly turn them over, and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until they're very dry and beginning to brown. Remove them from the oven, cool completely, and store in an airtight container. Yield: about 60 biscotti

This recipe makes use of a favorite American baking ingredient -- chips, in this case butterscotch. Use this recipe as a jumping off place for variations ranging from chocolate chips and walnuts; to mint chocolate and white chocolate chips (no nuts); to butter brickle and almonds -- let your imagination be your guide.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pastry Dough:
  1 1/4           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose or
                        Round Table Unbleached Pastry Flour
     1/4           cup  butter -- (1/2 stick) cold
     1/2           cup  cream cheese -- (4 ounces)
  1         tablespoon  water -- (1 to 2)
  1              pinch  salt
                        Filling:
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  brown sugar (light or dark)
     1/4           cup  butter -- (1/2 stick) melted
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  2          teaspoons  water -- rum or bourbon
  1                cup  raisins (traditional version) or nuts
                        (non-traditional version)

Pastry Dough: Put the flour in a bowl, or in the work bowl of a food processor. Add the cold butter, the cream cheese, and the salt. Mix together until everything is evenly crumbly. If using the food processor, just a few quick pulses are all you'll need.

Sprinkle the dough with the cold water and toss. Squeeze the dough to determine if it will hold together. If it's too dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time, using just enough so the dough will hold together. Gather the dough into a ball, flatten it into a disk and refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer.

Filling: Beat the egg with a whisk until fluffy. Add the sugar, and beat well. Add in remaining ingredients except the raisins or nuts. (We find it easiest to divide the filling evenly among the tarts by putting one tablespoon of raisins or nuts in each tart, then adding the sugar and butter mixture.

Assembly and Baking: Roll the pastry dough out on a lightly floured table until it's about -inch thick. Cut round circles to size; measure the bottom diameter and height of your intended pan, then add bottom diameter + two times the height to reach the diameter of your dough circle. (See? That 7th grade math DID come in useful!) If you're using our mini tart pans, use a 3-inch round cutter. Alternatively, you may divide the dough into equal pieces, roll into balls, then press into the bottom and up the side of the pans.

Divide the raisins or nuts among the tarts, then top with the sugar and egg mixture. Note: Don't fill more than two-thirds full, or the tarts will boil over. Bake the tarts for 15 minutes in a preheated 400F oven. Let the tarts cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, or until you can handle them easily. Use the tip of a knife to loosen any spots that may have boiled over, then pop them out onto a rack to finish cooling. Barely sweetened whipped cream is an excellent accompaniment. Yield: About 24 mini tarts; 10 small (3-inch) tarts, or 1 pie

(We suggest making small or mini tarts, as the larger pie is really sticky. However, if you enjoy the decadence of sweet, gooey filling dripping over your fingers and down your chin, go for the pie!) A rich, cream cheese and butter-based crust cradles these tarts' intensely sweet, dark filling, which is gooey when hot, then chewy when cooled. We found these addictive; each time a new batch came out of the oven, we had to taste them "just once more."

                        Cake:
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
     1/3           cup  buttermilk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine -- (5 1/3 tablespoons)
                        melted
                        Filling:
  2               cups  blueberries -- fresh or frozen
                        (unthawed)
                        Topping:
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/3           cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ginger and nutmeg
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- (1/2 stick)

For Cake: Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Beat egg, buttermilk and vanilla; stir in melted butter or margarine. Add dry ingredients, stirring until well mixed.

Spread batter in a well-greased 9x9-inch pan. Sprinkle with blueberries.

For Topping: Mix topping ingredients until crumbly, then spread over blueberries. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 45 minutes, or until topping is brown.

A buckle is a kind of coffeecake made with fruit -- usually blueberries -- and a sugar/spice topping. Tradition has it that the name comes from the way the cake "buckles" as it bakes, rising around its fruit topping (which is also sinking), so that the cake finishes with a very uneven top surface.

We present here a traditional blueberry buckle. A very moist cake, it's best served hot out of the oven (with whipped cream/ice cream if desired), or warm. If allowed to sit longer than 12 hours or so, the buckle tends to become mushy. Although blueberry is the usual fruit found in a buckle, try it with other berries or with summer fruits, which have been diced and well-drained.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Marinade/Dressing
  1       large cloves  garlic -- peeled and minced
                        (1 to 2)
  3                     anchovy fillets -- finely minced
                        (optional)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2         tablespoon  Dijon-style mustard
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  sour cream
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese
  1           teaspoon  coarsely ground black pepper
                        Filling
  1              pound  boneless chicken breasts or thighs
  1                     red pepper -- quartered
  1              large  onion -- peeled and sliced
                    in  - 1 1/2 inch slices
  1             medium  zucchini -- sliced crosswise
                        into 1/4-inch thick slices
                        romaine lettuce -- shredded

Marinade and Dressing: Stir together the minced garlic, lemon juice, mustard, minced anchovy, Worcestershire sauce and sour cream. Whisk in the olive oil. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and ground black pepper. You may do all of this in the food processor by processing together the garlic, lemon juice, anchovy or Worcestershire sauce, and sour cream. Drizzle the olive oil through the feed tube with the motor running, then gently pulse in the Parmesan and black pepper.

Filling: Use about 1/4 of the dressing to marinate the chicken and vegetables for 30 minutes. Discard the marinade, then grill the chicken and vegetables over medium coals until done (or saute them in a skillet). Cool, then slice the chicken and cut the vegetables into bite-size pieces. Toss the meat mixture with shredded romaine lettuce, using as much romaine as you like to "stretch" the chicken. Mix in the remaining dressing to taste. Note: Vegetables and chicken may be grilled ahead, then refrigerated until ready to serve; tosses with lettuce and dressing at the last minute.

Assembly: Spoon some of the filling down the center of each bread and serve immediately. Yield: 8 sandwiches.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  2            packets  active dry yeast
  2               cups  lukewarm milk
  8 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1                     egg -- well beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  butter -- (2 sticks) melted
  1         tablespoon  vital wheat gluten (optional)

     1/3           cup  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick) melted
                        Frosting:
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick) room
                        temperature
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        grated zest and juice of 1/2 orange
  1         tablespoon  hazelnut liqueur -- such as Frangelico,
                        or almond liqueur, such as Amaretto (1 to
  1 1/2                 )

Manual Method: Dissolve the yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in the lukewarm water. Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, and mix until fairly smooth. Knead the dough, by hand for 10 minutes, or with your mixer equipped with the dough hook for 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and supple. Turn the dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise until puffy, 1 to 2 hours.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Dough or Manual, and press Start. Check the dough during the final 10 minutes of the kneading cycle, adding additional flour or water as needed to produce a smooth, supple dough. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface; divide it in half. Working with one piece at a time, pat and then roll the dough into an 18 x 24-inch rectangle.

Filling: Brush the dough with the butter, leaving a 1-inch bare edge along one long side. Combine the remaining filling ingredients -- sugar, salt and cinnamon -- and sprinkle them evenly over the dough.

Assembly: Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a long log (not too tightly, or the centers of the rolls will pop up during baking). Make sure to finish up at the edge that isn't brushed with milk or butter. Brush that edge with water and pull it up over the log, pinching to seal. Roll the log so it's seam-side-down on your work surface.

Use a ruler to mark off 1 1/2-inch intervals, then use a serrated knife to gently cut 20 rolls; you may also loop dental floss around the log at each interval and pull, which gives you a nice, clean cut. Transfer the rolls to lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between each roll. These will fit on a full-sheet pan or two half-sheet pans.

Brush the sides of each roll with melted butter or vegetable oil, if desired; this makes the rolls easier to pull apart after they're baked. Cover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap, and set them aside to rise until puffy but perhaps not doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Bake the rolls in a preheated 350F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, reversing the pans midway through. They should be golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool slightly, as you prepare the frosting.

Frosting: Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, sugar, cinnamon, salt, orange juice and rind (or orange oil), and liqueur. Beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. The mixture should be of spreading consistency, like a soft butter cream frosting.

Using a metal spatula, frost the rolls while they're warm. Remove them from the pan, and allow them to cool on a wire rack. Eat them soon, or freeze them, well wrapped, for later use. (If you're going to freeze the rolls, it's better not to frost them before freezing.)

To Reheat Rolls: Remove the rolls from the freezer, and allow them to thaw, in their wrapping, at room temperature. This will take 1 to 1 1/2 hours, more or less. Remove the wrapping, and bake the rolls in a preheated 350F oven for about 7 minutes, or until they're very hot. Remove them from the oven, and frost them. To reheat in the microwave, remove the rolls from their wrapping and microwave for no more than 30 seconds. Better still, heat them in a microwave set on defrost until they're warm. Serve rolls immediately. Yield: 40 rolls

Cinnamon rolls -- what better way to wake up early on a sunny winter morning than with the smell of cinnamon wafting through the house? The following recipe comes from Carl Nelson of Whittier, California, who wrote to thank us for our catalogue, and to say he appreciates "the interesting items and ingredients that are not easy to find locally." He also sent a photo of himself with the note, "Enclosed is a photo of me proudly displaying my last batch of cinnamon rolls. They made quite a hit with our family and friends."

Carl also wrote the following: "My dad and mother were born in Sweden, where Dad had a seven-year apprenticeship in baking before he came to this country. Dad and I operated, for a number of years, the largest Swedish bakery in the West. It was located in Los Angeles, and we enjoyed having some interesting customers: Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman (she didn't come in person -- her uncle shopped for her), and each week we delivered an order to Mary Pickford at Pickfair. There were others, of course.

"I miss the baking business, but try to keep my hand in the dough at home. A couple of years ago I purchased a Zojirushi bread machine. Our friends thought I had gone bonkers. Although I did use the machine for a time to bake bread from start to finish, I was not pleased by the fact that, with the pre-timing of the process, loaves would not be uniform in size. Therefore, when I use the machine (and I still do occasionally), I use it for preparation of the dough only, after which I mold the loaf and place it in a regular bread pan. This way, I can adjust the rising time according to weather conditions, etc. And not only that, with this method it resembles a traditional loaf of bread -- I like that!

                           Carmelized Pear Cake

Recipe By     :www.kingarthurflour.com
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Fruit Topping
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  3                     Bartlett or red Bartlett pears -- peeled, cored, and
                        sliced
                        Cake
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4           cup  milk
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted and cooled.

The Topping: In an 8-inch round stove top cake pan, or in a small saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the sugar. Stir until the sugar melts, and remove the pan from the heat. If you've made the syrup in a saucepan, transfer it to an 8-inch round cake pan. Toss the pears and nutmeg together, and arrange the pears in a circular pattern atop the sugar syrup. (Be careful not to burn your fingers!) Set aside.

The Cake: In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. In a separate bowl, beat together the milk, eggs, and butter. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Spread the batter over the pears, using a spatula; the batter will be quite stiff.

Bake the cake in a preheated 400F oven for 20 minutes, or until it tests done. Remove the cake from the oven, and run a knife around the edge to loosen it from the pan. Invert the cake immediately onto a plate, scraping any sugar or pear bits which cling to the bottom of the pan onto the top of the cake. Yield: 6 generous servings

Pears and caramelized sugar are a delectable combination; in this recipe, they top a very simple unsweetened cake. The result is something a little different for brunch, or even served alongside a roast ham or pork tenderloin.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- (1 stick)
  1                cup  grated Cheddar cheese -- (4 ounces)
  1         tablespoon  coarsely ground black pepper*
     3/4           cup  buttermilk or plain yogurt -- (6 ounces)
                        milk (for glaze)

*This amount of black pepper will make very spicy scones. For less heat, decrease the amount of pepper.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. Cut in the butter and cheese. Stir in the black pepper. Refrigerate the dough for half an hour. Gently stir in the buttermilk or yogurt. Gather the mixture into a ball with your hands, and on a well-floured surface roll or pat the dough into an 12 x 8-inch rectangle approximately 3/4-inch thick.

Grease a baking sheet. Using a large spatula, or a couple of spatulas, transfer the dough to the baking sheet. Use a dough scraper, baker's bench knife or a knife to cut dough into 1 1/2-inch squares. Separate the squares slightly on the baking sheet. Brush each square with a little milk""

Bake the scones in a preheated 400F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're very lightly browned. Yield: about 40 small scones

Scones, formerly known mainly to fanciers of British food, have become very familiar to most of us on this side of the ocean, due to their bakery and coffee-shop popularity over the past 5 years or so. Wedges, squares or circles of a buttery biscuit-type dough, baked quickly at high heat till golden brown, scones usually come plain or dotted with fruit or nuts. Spread with butter and jam or preserves, they've become a staple at breakfast and tea time.

But scones needn't be thought of as simply a sweet treat. Offer a savory version in the bread basket at your main meal. They're very similar to baking powder biscuits, and are easily seasoned to go with whatever you're serving.

  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2           cup  non-instant dry milk powder (optional)
  1         tablespoon  dill weed
  4               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        --
                        (approximately)
  2               cups  King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat or
                        -- 100% White Whole Wheat Flour
  2               cups  minced scallions
  2               cups  grated reduced-fat cheddar cheese

Pour the water into a large bowl. Add the yeast and the honey and stir until dissolved. Add 1 cup of the all-purpose flour and stir until dissolved. Add 1 cup of the all-purpose flour and stir. Let this sit for 10 minutes, to give the yeast a chance to get going.

Mix the salt, milk powder, dill weed and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Add to the yeast mixture and stir well. Stir in the scallions and the cheddar cheese.

Add the rest of the flours, one cup at a time, stirring well after each addition, until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough has formed a smooth ball.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a draft-free place and let rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in bulk.

Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead briefly to expel any air bubbles. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each into a rope that is 24-inches long. Divide each snake into 24 one-inch pieces. Roll each piece into a round ball and place the rolls on greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheets. The rolls should be placed 2 inches apart.

Spray the rolls with water or cover with damp towels. Let rise for about 30 minutes, or until slightly swollen. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned and baked through. Cool the rolls on racks. Yield 48 two-inch rolls

                       Cheese And Currant Biscuits

                Daily Bread Mailing List        Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper*
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  shortening
  8             ounces  grated Cheddar cheese -- (about 2 cups)
     1/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  currants -- (6 ounces)

*This amount of cayenne produces a biscuit that is noticeably hot, but not searingly so; adjust the quantity to your own taste.

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cayenne, mustard, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter and shortening, then add the cheese. Stir in the milk and currants to form a stiff, cohesive dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes. This serves two purposes: it relaxes the gluten in the flour, allowing the dough to become more extensible (i.e., easier to roll out), and it solidifies the fat, which will result in a more tender biscuit.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface, and roll it out about 1/4-inch thick; this is just about as thin as the currants allow you to roll it. Using a rolling pizza wheel (the easiest method), a sharp knife or a baker's bench knife, cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares. Transfer the squares to lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheets, leaving about 1/2 inch between each.

Bake the biscuits in a preheated 375F oven for 14 to 15 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown, and a slightly darker brown around the edges. Watch out -- they start to brown very quickly towards the end of the baking time, so keep your eye on them. Yield: 60 biscuits

There's a traditional Southern tea recipe that wraps a very spicy cheese biscuit dough around a whole pitted date, resulting in a sweet and savory combination that is an interesting change from the all-sweet cookie or the all-savory cheese cracker. This variation on that theme produces the same neat combination of tastes and textures -- sweet and salty, crisp and chewy.

When we tested the recipe here at King Arthur, every person except one said they liked the biscuits; that one nay-sayer said she would have preferred nuts to currants (she suggested pecans, walnuts or pistachios), making it an all-savory cheese cracker. While this would undoubtedly be a tasty variation, it misses the point of this particular biscuit, which we find appealingly "half a bubble off plumb," as they'd say in Maine: familiar, but different; almost normal, but not quite.

By the way, this biscuit is more akin to the traditional British biscuit (a cookie or cracker) than to the soft rolls we call biscuits in America. These "biscuits" are about the thickness of a soda cracker, and crunchy, tender and a bit chewy all at the same time. Serve them as part of a cracker assortment; a bit of cream cheese and pepper jelly is a nice accompaniment.

                        Fruit Filling:
  1              pound  fresh rhubarb (approximately 4 cups
                        chopped)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                can  crushed pineapple in juice -- (16 ounces)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
                        Crust:
  5               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        --
                        (approximately)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast -- (really!)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  milk
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  4                     eggs
                        Cheese Filling:
  24            ounces  cream cheese -- (three 8-ounce
                        packages) room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vanilla
                        Topping:
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- chilled, cut into
                        chunks

For fruit filling: Clean the rhubarb and chop it into 1/2-inch pieces. Put in a bowl, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar, and let sit several hours or overnight, till the rhubarb releases some of its juice.

Place the undrained rhubarb in a heavy saucepan, add the 1/2 cup sugar and undrained pineapple, and stir to combine. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture is like thick applesauce. Stir more frequently toward the end of the cooking time, so filling doesn't burn. This will take about 1 hour. Remove from heat and set aside. When cool, stir in vanilla.

For crust: Heat milk and butter, cut in pieces, in a saucepan over medium heat until mixture reaches about 120F. Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a bowl. Pour milk mixture over dry ingredients, stirring to mix well. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add an additional 3 1/2 cups of flour, mixing to combine. Turn the dough onto a well-floured work surface and knead, adding additional flour as necessary, until dough is smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat all surfaces, cover bowl, and set in a warm spot to rise until dough is doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.

For cheese filling: Beat the cream cheese, eggs, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Set aside.

For topping: Mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Cut in the butter, as you would for pie crust, working it in until mixture is coarse and crumbly.

To assemble: Butter a 12x18x1-inch rimmed baking sheet (a half-sheet pan). Punch dough down, and divide into two pieces. On a large, well-floured surface, roll one piece of dough into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Fit into pan. Spread cheese filling on dough in pan to within 1/2-inch of edge, then top evenly with fruit filling. Roll the second piece of dough into a 14x18-inch rectangle, to stretch over filling. Place it on top of the filling, then seal edges, trimming off any extra dough. Brush top crust with melted butter, and sprinkle with topping. Let rise in a warm place for about 15 minutes, while you preheat the oven to 350F.

Bake cake for 45 minutes, or until cake is golden brown and firm to the touch. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 24 3x3-inch pieces

NOTES : This mammoth coffeecake, designed to feed a crowd, elicited lots of praise from our crew here at the office, both for its appearance and its taste. Featuring a cheese Danish-like filling enveloped by a yeasted sweet dough crust, topped with rhubarb/pineapple sauce, and gilded with streusel topping, this cake will easily feed 20 people, and it's equally good for breakfast or as a dessert.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  grated sharp cheddar cheese -- (8 ounces)
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper* -- (1/8 to 1/4)
                        paprika (optional)

*1/8 teaspoon is discernible, while 1/4 teaspoon packs a moderate punch. Use more if you want a truly eye-watering experience.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients to make a cohesive dough, sprinkling in a tablespoon or so of water if the dough doesn 't seem to want to come together. As soon as the dough starts to come together, turn off the mixer and gather it into a rough ball. Transfer it to a lightly floured work surface, and roll it into a 16-inch log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the log in waxed paper or plastic wrap, and chill it in the freezer for 30 minutes. (If you want to freeze them for a longer amount of time, just make sure to remove them from the freezer about 30 minutes before you want to slice them.)

Using a serrated knife, slice the log crosswise into 1/8-inch rounds. Place them on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving only about 1/2 inch between them; they won't spread much as they bake. Sprinkle them with a bit of paprika, if desired.

Bake the cheese pennies in a preheated 400F oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until they're just beginning to brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool on the pan for several minutes before transferring them to racks to cool completely. Yield: about eighty 1 1/2-inch pennies

NOTES : The following recipe is for one of our favorite '50s snacks: cheese pennies, a high-fat concoction of cheese and butter held together with a bit of flour and baked into golden brown "pennies." I'm sure I never had the spicy variety as a kid; but my well-worn taste buds think a hit of cayenne are just the ticket these days. These are good served with drinks -- non-alcoholic, or otherwise.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2                     eggs
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  cherries -- pitted, coarsely
                        chopped, and drained
  1                cup  slivered almonds -- lightly toasted
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
                        granulated sugar

Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time.

Sift together dry ingredients and add them to butter/sugar mixture alternately with milk. Stir in almond extract, then gently fold in almonds and cherries.

Spoon muffin batter into 12 greased muffin cups; cups will be quite full. Sprinkle each muffin with a little granulated sugar, and bake in a preheated 375F oven for 30 minutes, or until muffins test done.

The first muffin recipe, found in Hannah Glasse's 1747 book, "The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy," begins, "To a bushel of Hertfordshire white flour, take a pint and a half of Good Ale Yeast..." Obviously, Hannah was cooking for a crowd. Muffins, at first a purely English specialty, gradually made their way to America, and by 1899 Theodore Francis Garrett was able to write, in his "The Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery," "It has been claimed for the British baker that he alone can make a muffin; but it is almost to be feared, if this were ever so that the prestige has been passed over to America, where muffins are made of various flours, and so light and digestible that it is a question if they are not rather an American dish."

Mention muffins today, and you'll conjure up visions of blueberry, date-nut, cranberry or other fruit muffins. Sweet summer fruits are a wonderful addition to a basic muffin batter; the following version teams cherries and almonds, a fruit and nut that were made for one another.

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  thick oat flakes (or "old fashioned"
                        rolled oats)
     3/4          cups  firmly packed dark brown sugar
     1/2           cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  6        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  4               cups  pitted Bing cherries (or other fruit -- diced, or
                        berries)

Butter an 8x8-inch pan and pour fruit into it. Mix together oats, sugar, flour, cinnamon and cardamom; cut in butter till mixture is crumbly. Pour topping onto fruit. Bake at 375F for 30 minutes, or until fruit bubbles and topping is brown. This is best served warm, with ice cream or whipped cream. Make it up any time during the day, put in the refrigerator, then bake just before serving.

The derivation of these terms is quite easy to see: fresh fruit is layered in a pan and topped with a mixture of sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon, with thick oat flakes ("old-fashioned" rolled oats) added in some versions. (Some cookbooks even make the distinction: crisps contain oatmeal, crumbles do not.) The dish is baked, causing the fruit to exude its juice and bubble, while the topping becomes brown and crisp. When you bite into this simple, luscious dessert, the crisp topping crumbles -- thus "crisp" and "crumble."

The following recipe for crisp uses whole pitted Bing cherries, but any berries and most other fruits, diced, are also good. We do like to add the oats to the topping, too; we find they give the dish an interesting, nutty flavor and texture that flour, sugar and butter alone can't duplicate.

                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough
  1                cup  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  non-diastatic malt powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1                cup  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
     1/2           cup  freshly grated -- lightly packed
                        Parmesan cheese
                        Water Bath:
  2             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  non-diastatic malt powder
                        Egg Wash:
  1                     egg beaten lightly with 1 tablespoon water
                        kosher or coarse sea salt -- for topping

Mixer Method: Mix the water, malt powder, yeast and white wheat flour together in the bowl of an electric mixer and let sit for 5 minutes. Add the semolina and salt, and beat well. Gradually add the bread flour until the dough is a cohesive ball, kneading on medium speed for a total of 5 to 8 minutes. Mix in the Parmesan before you add the last 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour, and knead until the cheese is well-distributed through the dough. The finished dough should be smooth, elastic, and on the stiff side. Transfer the dough to an ungreased bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. About 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle, check the dough; it should be smooth and elastic, and on the stiff side, as indicated above. Adjust the consistency of the dough with additional water or flour, as necessary. When the machine has completed its cycle, transfer the dough to a clean work surface.

Shaping: Punch down the dough, let it rest, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, then roll it out to a 12 x 12-inch square. Place a large, deep pot containing the water bath ingredients onto the stove, and begin to heat the water to boiling.

Use a sharp knife or rolling pizza wheel to cut the dough into 32 equal pieces, approximately 3/4-inch wide by 6 inches long. The easiest way to do this is to cut the dough into 16 equal pieces in the vertical direction, then cut those in half with one swipe in the horizontal direction. If you want, you can roll each piece a bit under your fingers to form more of a log shape; on the other hand, you can leave the pieces as they are, and they'll look more "stick-like."

When the water has come to a full boil, turn the heat down so it's at a gentler rolling boil, and drop in 4 or 5 pieces of dough at a time. Boil for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the dough has risen to the surface of the water and puffed noticeably. Don't let them boil any longer than this or they may deflate!

Drain each piece well with a slotted spoon or skimmer-type utensil, and carefully transfer to a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush each bread stick gently with the egg wash and sprinkle with as much or as little salt as you crave.

Bake in a preheated 425F oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn the bread sticks over and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack. These are much better several hours after they've cooled; before then they may taste a little gummy, so give them a bit of time, but also be sure to eat them on the same day they're made. Yield: 32 bread sticks

Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the bread sticks in this recipe approximate what I would call a New York salt stick. Made from a dough similar to that of bagels, and boiled before baking, also as for bagels, this is the perfect, toothsome bread stick to really sink your jaws into.

The first time I made them, I used much too much topping salt (in my opinion), thereby creating a veritable second crust. Never the salt aficionado -- in fact, I never even baked with it until I understood its importance in developing a good, strong yeasted bread dough -- I cut back on the outer amount in the final version. But feel free to dust and decorate with however much you see fit, remembering that the cheese will add quite a bit of its own flavor. -- A.S.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  chickpea flour
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  vegetable shortening
  6        tablespoons  water -- (6 to 7)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- for topping

Preheat the oven to 325F. Combine the flours, sugar, spices and salt in a food processor or medium mixing bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender, two knives or the food processor until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Mix in the water gradually, until the dough holds together in a ball but isn't sticky. Divide the dough in half and roll each piece out separately on a lightly floured surface to a 12 x 12-inch square, 1/8-inch thick. Yes, it is important to roll the dough this thinly, so be gentle but firm when you do it. If the dough seems unusually resistant, just cover it with a towel and give it a 15-minute rest; it should prove more placid once the gluten relaxes.

Use a sharp knife or a rolling pizza wheel to cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares, and transfer as many as you can at a time (a giant spatula works well here) to ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheets. Or, transfer each sheet of dough directly to the baking sheet with your spatula, rolling pin or hands, and then cut it into squares, separating the squares.

Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven, spray the tops of the crackers lightly with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with salt (or some dried granulated garlic, which is also good). Return the crackers to the oven and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more, until nicely golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack. Yield: approximately 120 small crackers

NOTES : Put away those soda crackers! The next time you want to serve crackers with your soup, reach for these instead. Light and crisp, with a hint of sweetness. If you've ever made pie crust, you won't have any trouble with these; even if you're not a pastry expert (or even novice), just remember to use a light hand and they'll turn out fine. A complementary addition to bean soups especially, because of the chickpea flour they contain, crackers like these are also a perfect base for your homemade hummus.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7                     eggs -- separated*
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar or 1 teaspoon lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  sugar -- divided
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  milk (whole or skim -- or buttermilk for
                        chocolate cake)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  almond extract (or 1/4 teaspoon Fiori di
                        Sicilia flavoring)

*Separate the eggs carefully; even a small amount of yolk in the whites will prevent them from beating up properly.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar or lemon juice until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar and continue beating until stiff and glossy. Set aside.

Whisk together the remaining 1 cup sugar with the flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the oil, milk, egg yolks and flavorings until pale yellow. Add the dry ingredients and beat until well blended, about 2 minutes at medium speed using a stand mixer, or longer with a hand mixer.

Gently fold in the whipped egg whites, using a wire whip or cake blender. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl so the batter is well-blended. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan or angel food pan, or two 9-inch round ungreased cake pans. Bake the cake in a preheated 325F oven. If it's in a tube or angel food pan, bake it for 50 minutes, then turn up the heat to 350F for the final 10 minutes, making a total baking time of 1 hour. If you're using two 9-inch cake pans, bake for about 40 minutes at 325F, then 10 minutes more at 350F. Don't open the oven during the first 45 minutesof baking; the cake will rise high above the pan, then settle back almost even. It's done when a finger gently pressed in the middle doesn't leave a print, and you can hear a crackling sound if you listen carefully. Cool the cake upside down for 1/2 hour before removing it from the pan. If you've used a tube pan, set it atop a thin-necked bottle, threading the bottle neck through the hole in the tube. Frost the cake, and cut it just before serving; you'll need to dip a serrated knife in hot water between each slice if you want smooth, even pieces. Yield: One cake, about 18 servings


To assemble the cake (if you've made a tube-shaped cake), cut a 1-inch slice off the top of the cake, and reserve it. Slice a 3-inch-deep ring out of the middle of the cake, leaving 1-inch walls on each side. Pull out pieces of the cake to make a 3-inch "trench" in the cake. Don't cut through to the bottom of the cake. Fill the trench with chocolate filling. Place the top back on the cake and refrigerate it until ready to frost. If you've made round layers, simply spread the filling on one layer, and top it with the second layer. The cake should be made at least 4 hours before serving to allow time for the center to set properly.

Variations

To make a lemon chiffon cake, use lemon extract instead of vanilla extract and almond flavoring, and add 2 tablespoons grated lemon rind. Or substitute 1/2 teaspoon lemon oil for the extract and peel. For a chocolate chiffon cake, decrease the flour to 1 3/4 cups, and mix in 1/3 cup Dutch-process cocoa. Also, use buttermilk for the liquid, if you have it; it'll give you the most intense chocolate flavor.

NOTES : Chiffon cake can be made plain and fancy in just about any flavor you could think of: lemon, orange, chocolate, peppermint, banana, or with bits of chocolate or nuts. It's often served with just a dusting of confectioners' sugar; with whipped cream and fresh fruit, or frosted with a fluffy boiled icing. (Skip the buttercream icing, it just seems to weigh it down.) The cake can also be hollowed out and filled with chiffon filling for a truly elegant dessert. (Cookbooks of the '50s seemed to use the word "elegant" quite often. We assume that after the ration-ticket war years, being able to be elegant once again was every housewife's dream!)
Chiffon cakes may be baked either in tube (angel food) pans, or in 9-inch round cake pans. Like an angel food cake, they must be cooled upside down to maintain their full height. This recipe makes a large cake, enough for 16 to 20 slices. It also freezes well, and is a good base for Baked Alaska or filled cakes that need to be served cold, because

                        Chinese Green Onion Cakes

Recipe By     :Sunset, May 1996
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
     1/2          cups  Boiling Water
     1/4            Lb  Bacon -- Diced
     1/2          cups  Thinly Sliced Green Onions -- Including Tops
  1                Tsp  Sesame Seeds
     1/4           Tsp  Sugar

Cooking Time: About 15 min
Prep Time: 45 - 50 min, including 30 min for the dough to rest Notes: For a one-day head start, make the dough and cook the bacon, then cover and chill both

Makes: 8 pieces

In a bowl, combine flour and 1/4 tsp salt. Stirring with a fork, add 1/2 C boiling water and mix until dough is moistened. Pat into a compact ball.

On a lightly floured board, knead dough until it feels smooth and satiny, about 3 min. Cover dough airtight and let stand at least 30 min.

In an 8 - 10" frying pan over med-high heat, stir bacon often until brown and crisp, about 5 min. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on towels. Reserve drippings.

On a lightly floured board, roll dough into an 8 x 16" rectangle. Brush dough with 2 - 3 tsp melted , but not hot, bacon drippings, then sprinkle bacon and green onions evenly almost to edge of rectangle.

Starting with a short side of the rectangle, roll up dough to snugly enclose filling and form a compact log. Pinch dough edge to log to seal. Gently press ends against the filled log.

Cut log crosswise into 8 equal rounds. Flatten each piece slightly with your palm, then sprinkle each lightly with sesame seeds.

Press each round until evenly thick and about 4" wide. If filling pops out, press back into dough.

Place rounds, without crowding, in a 10 - 12" frying pan over med to med-low heat. Cook, turning occasionally, until each side is dry looking and well speckled with brown, 6 - 8 min total.

Mix remaining 1/4 tsp salt with sugar. As hot, browned cakes come from pan, sprinkle them lightly with salt-sugar mixture. Serve cakes hot, warm, or at room temp.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  cocoa -- Dutch-process or
                        natural
  1 3/4           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/4           cups  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chocolate chips
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  2          teaspoons  vinegar
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- (1 stick) melted

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cocoa, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and chocolate chips. Set aside.

In a large measuring cup or medium- sized mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla and vinegar. Add the wet ingredients, along with the melted butter or margarine, to the dry ingredients, stirring to blend; there's no need to beat these muffins, just make sure everything is well- combined.

Scoop the batter into 12 lightly greased muffin cups. Bake the muffins in a preheated 425F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean (watch them closely, as they'll burn around the edges if they bake too long). Remove the muffins from the oven, and after 5 minutes remove them from the pan, allowing them to cool slightly on a wire rack before serving. Yield: 12 muffins

NOTES : Chocolate -- for breakfast? Hey, loosen up -- it's the holidays. After all, you used to drink hot chocolate when you were a kid, right? And if you were in Paris right now, you might be standing on the corner outside the local boulangerie, a steaming cup of cafe au lait in one hand and a fresh petit pain au chocolat in the other. Chocolate for breakfast? Go for it.

My personal memories of hot chocolate begin with Franklin's Drugstore in Glastonbury, Connecticut, the town in which I grew up. I'm sure there were drugs and heating pads and stuff like that somewhere in Franklin's, but we kids thought of Franklin's strictly as the local source for candy and comic books and baseball cards. Each Sunday my dad would give us a nickel after church, and we'd agonize over the pink bubble gum cigars, wax lips, and giant SweeTarts. (If we were lucky enough to get a dime, rock candy was the hands-down choice.) I remember vividly Dad plopping the Hartford Courant down on the counter, and each of us three kids adding our nickel treasure on top. After that it was a stop at the Colonial Bakery (half-moon cookies, golden cupcakes, chocolate eclairs), then home to a big breakfast of cinnamon coffee cake and scrambled eggs, followed by Sunday dinner - a quaint old custom involving a Roast and Vegetables and Company, which many of you probably remember.
So where does the hot chocolate come in? Franklin's also had a "soda fountain," a counter with tall revolving stools where you could sit and get a dish of ice cream, a grilled cheese sandwich, a cup of coffee -- any of that typical drugstore fare. The counter at Franklin's was the place where locals met to discuss the weather, town politics, or maybe the upcoming harvest; at that time, Glastonbury still harbored a significant number of tobacco and corn fields, and peach and apple orchards. My dad, principal of the local junior high and a lifelong avid coffee drinker, liked to drop by Franklin's for a cup. And sometimes, if I was on hand at just the right moment, I got to go with him. "Where are you going, Daddy?" "Crazy, want to come along?" I knew that meant we were going downtown, with a visit to Franklin's in the offing.

I remember in particular a winter day, dark gray with heavy, wet snowflakes falling that filled the streets and sidewalks with slush. We entered Franklin's, Dad and I, to a blast of hot, steamy air, redolent of wet wool from the faintly steaming coats of those who'd just come in from the snowy afternoon. I was very small; the men at the counter, towering above me on the revolving stools, looked very big. But Dad lifted me up beside him, and suddenly I was big, too; I felt important and old. He ordered a cup of coffee for himself, a hot chocolate for me. Paul the druggist delivered identical thick crockery mugs, both steaming, mine sporting a froth of whipped cream on top. I spooned up the whipped cream, then slowly twirled on my chair, waiting for the chocolate to cool, and wishing my sister or brother could be there to see what a big shot I was. At that moment -- harbored against the storm in a warm, bright room, surrounded by a crowd of benign adults, and drinking hot chocolate -- I was at a place every child should be more than once in their life: safe, warm, loved, and fed. That singular memory, in all its incarnations -- mental, emotional and physical -- has stayed with me to this day. Thanks, Dad!

The following muffins are rich and tender, high-rising, and deep chocolate, both in color and flavor. Warm from the oven, spread with butter or raspberry jam, they're a totally decadent way to greet the day. While we offer them here in our holiday issue, we recommend them anytime you feel like treating yourself to something really special. And, by the way, they don't need to be relegated to the breakfast table; frosted with fudgy icing, they double as an awesome cupcake. A final aside -- one of the King Arthur taste-tester comments we received was as follows: "This is the best chocolate thing I've ever had to eat in my whole life, and the best thing I've ever eaten here at King Arthur." Fair praise, indeed! -- P.J.H.

Soften the gelatin in the cold water for 1 minute, then stir it into the hot chocolate mixture. Pour it into a bowl and let it cool to room temperature. To speed up the cooling process, set the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice water. Stir with a rubber spatula until it's room temperture. Be carefuil not to let the gelatin set up.

When the chocolate mixture is cool, whip 1 cup heavy cream with 1 teaspoon vanilla. Fold this into the chocolate mixture.

NOTES : For a filled cake, try the following: This filling can be used for a fluffy chiffon pie (simply spoon it into a prebaked pie shell) as well as the filling for a chiffon cake. It has a very slight bitterness to it, to play nicely against the sweetness of the cake; feel free to increase the amount of sugar to 1 cup if you have a real sweet tooth, or substitute an 8-ounce semi-sweet chocolate bar for the unsweetened chocolate.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract

  3 1/2           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread

     1/2           cup  walnut halves
  1                cup  chocolate chips -- semi-sweet

Place all of the ingredients except the chocolate chips and walnuts into the pan of your bread machine. Program the machine for raisin bread, if possible.

Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional water or flour. Add the chips and nuts at the signal; or, if you have no raisin bread cycle, add them about 3 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle. Yield: one 6- to 7-inch loaf

                        (about 1 cup)

*Sour milk is easily prepared by stirring 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice into 1 cup of milk, then waiting 5 minutes; the milk will "clabber" (look curdled).

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the margarine, oil and sugar. Beat in the eggs, vanilla and sour milk, yogurt or buttermilk.

In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients till thoroughly combined. Stir in the zucchini and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.

Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch pan. Bake the cake in a preheated 325F oven for 40 minutes. Slide the cake out of the oven, sprinkle it evenly with the additional chocolate chips, and return it to the oven for 5 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven, and use a cake spatula or rubber spatula to spread the chocolate chips into a smooth glaze. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 24 servings

                        chicken parts, including light and dark

  1              large  onion -- cut in chunks

  5             sprigs  fresh parsley

  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              quart  water

  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4          teaspoons  baking powder

     1/2           cup  shortening
  1                     egg
     2/3           cup  milk

*If you decide to use leftover cooked turkey or chicken, you'll need 2 to 2 1/4 pounds of boneless, skinless meat, which is between 6 and 7 cups of meat.

Filling: Place the chicken (or chicken parts), onion, carrots, parsley, thyme and salt in a deep stock pot. Add the water; it should almost cover the chicken (if it doesn't, add more). Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cover. Simmer the chicken and vegetables for about 1 1/4 hours (for a whole chicken) or 45 minutes to 1 hour (for chicken parts), till chicken is cooked through.

Remove the chicken and vegetables, discarding the vegetables and spreading the chicken on a platter to cool. Boil the stock till it's reduced to 2 1/2 cups; this will take about 45 minutes. If after 45 minutes there's more than 2 1/2 cups of stock remaining, simply measure out 2 1/2 cups, and save (or discard, or pour on your dog's food) the rest. Alternatively, you can use 20 ounces of canned chicken broth, about 1 1/2 cans.

Sauce: Skim the fat off the top of the stock, reserving 4 tablespoons and discarding the rest. Place the 4 tablespoons of fat in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of butter, and heat over medium heat till butter is melted. Add 6 tablespoons of flour, and stir to combine. Gradually pour in the 2 1/2 cups stock, whisking constantly. Cook and stir the sauce over medium heat till it comes to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer it for 5 minutes.

While the sauce is simmering, remove the skin and bones from the chicken, and tear it into 1-inch pieces. When the sauce is ready, stir in the chicken and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add ground black pepper and additional salt to taste.

Spoon the chicken into an 8 x 12-inch (or similar size) casserole dish; the dish should hold 2 to 3 quarts, and should be wide rather than deep, in order for the biscuits to fit on top

Biscuits: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Using a pastry blender, your fingers, or an electric mixer, cut in the shortening till the mixture is crumbly. Whisk together the egg and milk, and stir into the dry ingredients, mixing just till fully combined. The dough will be very wet and sticky.

Assembly: Preheat the oven to 450F. Using a spoon or cookie (or ice cream) scoop, drop the batter in golf ball-sized rounds onto the chicken, spacing them evenly and leaving a bit of room in between for expansion. Place the chicken and biscuits in the oven, and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve hot or warm. Yield: 8 to 12 servings, depending on the appetites involved

NOTES : This recipe could just as easily be titled Grange Supper Chicken Pie, or American Legion Supper Chicken Pie, or B.P.O.E., or Odd Fellows, the volunteer fire department, or any number of organizations -- New England and otherwise -- that have regular "suppers," fund-raising or just social. When we lived in Maine and belonged to the American Legion -- it was known to one and all simply as The Legion -- we regularly enjoyed the group's Monday night suppers. Large stainless steel trays of green beans or peas, cooked carrots, corn and mashed potatoes were set out across a counter that separated the basement kitchen from its adjoining dining hall. They were the comforting accompaniments to the meat course -- ham or chicken, usually, or maybe beef on a special occasion. Soft white rolls rounded out the entree, and the usual dessert was pie, cake or gingerbread. Everything was home-cooked by a couple of Legionnaire chefs; all was dished up by those same chefs and their helpers -- this was "wives' night out," and the women were strictly guests, not workers. We took the opportunity to talk about gardens and kids (or grandkids, for many of the women), while the men avidly rehashed the most recent high school boys' basketball game, the rehash always generously fleshed out with tales of teams gone by. It was fun; it was safe; it was a flashback to 1950s America, the part we remember with nostalgia.

Though I haven't been to many group suppers here in Vermont, I've heard the "Famous Hartland Roast Beef Dinner" (that's how it's billed in the newspaper), held every winter Saturday night, is something I need to sample. Chicken suppers and ham dinners abound, and during hunting season you'll run across an occasional ad for a game dinner. But one supper I seldom hear about these days, one that used to be quite popular, is the Vermont Church Chicken Pie Supper.

Maybe church attendance isn't what it used to be. Or maybe chicken pie is just too "common." But a good chicken pie, Vermont-style, is one of the most comforting foods I know. Boneless chicken in a thickened gravy made from its own juices is spooned into deep trays, then topped with mounds of biscuit dough. No peas; no carrots, nor onions, celery, nor anything else is included that might divert one's attention from the flavor of the chicken. The trays are placed in a hot oven and baked till the biscuits are golden brown, tender and flaky, and the chicken gravy is bubbling. As you go through the line, and receive your side dishes of green beans or peas and carrots, your mashed potatoes and your bread, the final stop is the chicken pie, where a large serving of aromatic chicken and gravy, crowned with a biscuit, is gently spooned onto your plate.

Now, you may gild the lily by breaking open the biscuit and melting some butter into it, but it really isn't necessary; I prefer to simply tamp down some of the biscuit (so it merges with the gravy), leave the rest on top, and enjoy biscuit and chicken in every ambrosial bite. We're not living in Maine anymore, but as they say in that state -- Ummm-ummm! Some good!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  instant yeast
  1                cup  milk
  4 3/4           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
  1                     egg -- well beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick) melted
  1         tablespoon  Lora Brody's Bread Dough Enhancer
                        Filling:
  2        tablespoons  milk
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  ground cinnamon
                        Frosting:
     1/4           cup  butter -- (1/2 stick) at room
                        temperature
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
     1/8      teaspoon  orange oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hazelnut liqueur -- such as Frangelico,
                        or almond liqueur, such as Amaretto (1
     1/2                ) -- (1/2 to 2 1/2)

Note: If orange juice and zest are omitted, add a little more of the liqueur.

Manual Method: Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, and mix until fairly smooth. Knead the dough, by hand for 10 minutes, or with your mixer equipped with the dough hook for 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and supple. Turn the dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise until puffy, 1 to 2 hours.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Dough or Manual, and press Start. Check the dough during the final 10 minutes of the kneading cycle, adding additional flour or water as needed to produce a smooth, supple dough. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface. Pat and then roll the dough into an 18 x 24-inch rectangle.

Filling: Brush the dough with the milk, leaving a 1-inch bare edge along one long side. Combine the remaining filling ingredients -- sugar, salt and cinnamon -- and sprinkle them evenly over the dough.

Assembly: Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a long log (not too tightly, or the centers of the rolls will pop up during baking). Make sure to finish up at the edge that isn't brushed with milk or butter. Brush that edge with water and pull it up over the log, pinching to seal. Roll the log so it's seam-side-down on your work surface.

Use a ruler to mark off 1 1/2-inch intervals, then use a serrated knife to gently cut 20 rolls; you may also loop dental floss around the log at each interval and pull, which gives you a nice, clean cut. Transfer the rolls to lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between each roll. These will fill two 9 x 13-inch pans, or two 12-inch deep-dish pizza pans.

Brush the sides of each roll with melted butter or vegetable oil, if desired; this makes the rolls easier to pull apart after they're baked. Cover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap, and set them aside to rise until puffy but perhaps not doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Bake the rolls in a preheated 350F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, reversing the pans midway through. They should be golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool slightly, as you prepare the frosting.

Frosting: Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, sugar, cinnamon, salt, orange juice and rind (or orange oil), and liqueur. Beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. The mixture should be of spreading consistency, like a soft butter cream frosting.

Using a metal spatula, frost the rolls while they're warm. Remove them from the pan, and allow them to cool on a wire rack. Eat them soon, or freeze them, well wrapped, for later use. (If you're going to freeze the rolls, it's better not to frost them before freezing.)

To Reheat Rolls: Remove the rolls from the freezer, and allow them to thaw, in their wrapping, at room temperature. This will take 1 to 1 1/2 hours, more or less. Remove the wrapping, and bake the rolls in a preheated 350F oven for about 7 minutes, or until they're very hot. Remove them from the oven, and frost them. To reheat in the microwave, remove the rolls from their wrapping and microwave for no more than 30 seconds. Better still, heat them in a microwave set on defrost until they're warm. Serve rolls immediately. Yield: 20 rolls

Notes: We found we had to use more flour than most cinnamon roll recipes called for; we feel that bread flour may have been used, which is a higher protein flour and thus absorbs more liquid, while we were using all-purpose flour.

We increased the yeast, to speed the rise; increased the salt, for flavor; and substituted Lora Brody's Bread Dough Enhancer for the gluten, malt and ascorbic acid, for convenience.

We found that while brushing the rolled-out dough with butter before sprinkling it with the filling resulted in a buttery roll, it also resulted in one that "unraveled" easily; butter prevents the rolled dough from melding together when it bakes. We substituted milk for the butter to make the rolls hold together better. However, if you love butter and like to unravel your rolls, definitely go for the butter.

Note: If you're making sticky buns or rolled bread with a lot of filling and the bread tends to fall apart when sliced, brush the dough with a beaten egg before sprinkling on the filling; it'll hold together much better.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cinnamon Smear:
     1/2           cup  butterscotch chips
     1/3           cup  brown sugar -- firmly packed
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
                        Topping:
  1                     egg white -- beaten slightly
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
                        Dough:
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter -- cut into chunks
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  evaporated milk or half and half

Preheat your oven to 425F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.

Cinnamon Smear: Place the butterscotch chips, brown sugar, 3 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon cinnamon in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is rough and pasty looking (you can also do this in a blender). Set the mixture aside.

Topping: In a small bowl, whisk the egg white till it's lost its cohesion, but hasn't yet become frothy. In another bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon. Set aside.

Dough: Wipe out the work bowl of your processor with a paper towel, then place the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into the bowl. Process to blend. Add the butter in chunks, and process to break or cut the butter in, forming a mealy, crumbly mixture. Place this mixture in a large mixing bowl. Alternatively, you can use an electric mixer (or your hands, a whisk, and pastry fork or pastry blender) to combine the dry ingredients and cut in the butter.

In a small bowl or cup, blend together the egg, vanilla and evaporated milk (or half and half). Add this to the dry ingredients and stir with a fork until the dough just comes together. Turn the crumbly mass out onto a floured work surface and knead it gently, pressing the cinnamon smear mixture into the dough. It'll look marbleized; this is fine.

Roll or pat the dough into a 10 x 6-inch rectangle, about 1-inch thick, or 10-inch circle. Cut the dough into 12 to 14 squares or wedges. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, brush each with the egg white, then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.

Bake the scones about 12 to 15 minutes, or until their bottoms are browned and the tops are lightly golden. Yield: 12 to 14 scones

     1/4           cup  raisins or currants
  2          teaspoons  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        Topping
  1                     egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water

  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4           cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

Manual/Mixer Method: In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the dough ingredients, mixing till the dough begins to come away from the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough with an electric mixer for 2 minutes; allow it to rest for 15 minutes, then continue kneading it for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, or until it's smooth. If you're kneading by hand, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface; knead it for 3 minutes; allow it to rest for 15 minutes, then continue kneading till smooth, an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set it aside to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours; it'll be puffy, if not doubled in bulk.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. About 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, adjust the consistency of the dough with additional flour or water; it should be smooth, though still a bit sticky. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and shape it into a long, thin rectangle, about 16 x 8 inches. Brush the dough with some of the beaten egg, combine the filling ingredients, and pat them gently onto the dough. Beginning with a short edge, roll the dough into a log. Pinch the side seam and ends closed (to keep the filling from bubbling out), and place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap or a dough-rising cover, and allow the bread to rise for about 1 hour at room temperature, or until it's crowned about 1 inch over the rim of the pan.

In a small bowl or mini processor, combine the streusel ingredients, cutting in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. If you're using a mini processor, watch carefully; streusel will go from crumbly to a cohesive mass in just a second or so. Brush the loaf with some (or all) of the remaining beaten egg, and gently press on the streusel.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for about 45 minutes, tenting the loaf lightly with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes or so if it appears to be browning too quickly. Remove the loaf from the oven, and after about 5 minutes, gently remove it from the pan. Some of the streusel will fall off, but you cal alleviate this by first loosening all around the edges of the loaf with a knife, then turning the pan on its side and gently pulling it away from the loaf. Streusel will continue to fall off as you maneuver the bread -- we've never figured out how they make that stuff adhere so nicely on the store-bought loaves! -- but you'll still be left with some nice, sweet topping. Yield: 1 loaf

NOTES : The following recipe incorporates a couple of tips for successful cinnamon swirl bread that we've discovered over the years. First, for a deep-dark, moist, cinnamon swirl inside the bread, blend together sugar, cinnamon and raisins or currants till smooth. The addition of raisins or currants adds moistness, as well as subtle flavor. And second, rather than brush the dough with butter before sprinkling on the filling, brush it with beaten egg. Butter acts as a barrier between the pieces of rolled-up dough, preventing them from cohering, and giving you bread that "unravels" when you cut it. On the other hand, the protein in egg acts like glue, cementing the bread and filling together, and allowing much less (though still a bit) unraveling.

  2              large  eggs
  1 3/4           cups  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick) melted
                        and cooled to room temperature
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  2               cups  Round Table Unbleached Pastry OR 1 3/4
  1               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose
                        Flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar (leave this out if you want savory -- such as
                        the type you'd use as a base for creamed
                        chipped beef or creamed chicken)
                        waffles
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  pecan meal (optional)

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, melted butter or margarine and vanilla. In another bowl whisk together the dry ingredients. Combine the wet and dry ingredients just until almost smooth.

Spray your waffle iron with a non-stick cooking spray before preheating it. For an 8-inch round waffle iron, use about 1/3 cup batter. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the iron stops steaming. Yield: about ten 8-inch waffles

NOTES : This recipe is for a very typical plain waffle, crisp and golden, perfect with maple syrup and butter or berries and whipped cream. When made with pastry flour it will be extra crispy, and light as air inside. When made with all-purpose flour the waffle has a bit more body -- still light, but chewier on the inside. Waffles are best consumed as soon as they're baked, but in a pinch you may place them on a wire rack to cool, wrap tightly to store in the refrigerator, then reheat for 6 minutes in a 350F oven. The optional pecan meal add a nice nutty flavor.

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  Water
  2                Tsp  Sugar
  1                Tsp  Salt
  3 1/2           cups  White Flour -- Note 1
  1 1/2            Tsp  Yeast
  1               Tbsp  Cornmeal -- Optional
  1               Tbsp  Oil
  1                     Egg White -- Beaten
  1               Tbsp  Water

Note 1: In U.S., use Bread Flour; in Canada, use either Bread Flour or All Purpose Flour.

1. Measure first 5 ingredients in the order listed into Baking Pan.

2. Insert Baking Pan into oven chamber, twist to secure. Close lid.

3. Select: Dough / Pasta Setting.

4. Press Start There will be a 25 minute preheat delay before mixing begins.

5. When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine to a lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle.

6. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a 10 x 8 inch rectangle. Beginning at long end, roll up tightly as for jelly roll. Pinch seams and ends to seal. Taper ends by gently rolling back and forth.

7. Place each loaf, seam side down, on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal (optional). Lightly brush each loaf with oil. Cover and let rise in warm, draft free place until double in size, 20 to 30 minutes. With a sharp knife make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts about 1/4 inch deep across the top of each loaf. Lightly beat egg white and 1 tablespoon water; brush some of egg white mixture over top of each loaf. Bake at 350F for 20 minutes. Brush again with remaining egg white mixture.

8. Bake 5 to 10 minutes more or until done. Bread should sound hollow when tapped. (For even browning when baking two loaves, switch positions of sheets halfway through baking.) Remove the breads from the sheets; cool on a wire rack.

Makes 2 loaves.

Helpful Tip:
This crusty French bread, with its chewy texture, makes a delicious garlic bread. Just slice lengthwise, top with garlic butter & broil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Fruit
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice (if the berries aren't tart)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon (optional)
  1              quart  blueberries -- cleaned
                        Topping:
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter -- (1/2 stick)
  1                cup  buttermilk

Blend the water, sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon together in the skillet and stir in the blueberries. Bring to a gentle boil over low heat.

While the blueberries are heating, blend the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips. Quickly stir in the buttermilk.

Drop the biscuit dough in blobs over the blueberry mixture. Cover and cook over low heat until the biscuit dough is done, about 15 minutes.

Serve with blueberries spooned over the biscuits.

NOTES : This is one of those desserts from our childhood whose name used to send us into gales of laughter. In fact there may have been a certain amount of chuckling going on when it was first christened. First you need to picture how it was put together and cooked.

First you take a quart of blueberries (Cape Cod aside, wild blueberries grow in profusion on low, scrubby bushes scattered over rather barren land in Maine and all over the Northeast; the tiny tart ones from Maine are by far the most famous.)... preferably, tart Maine blueberries, stir in some sugar and water and put them in an iron spider (a cast iron skillet) or casserole dish that can sit on a burner. (Grunts used to be cooked in an open cast iron Dutch oven over the coals of a fire.) Then you top the berries with blobs of biscuit dough and let it cook very slowly.

As the concoction begins to heat, bubbles slowly work their way up from the bottom of the pot to break through the biscuit dough topping. The small snufflings you hear from the pot on top of the stove today probably sounded like a significant grunting of pigs in the huge cast iron pots that were used 300 years ago.

At any rate, the grunt may look just like fruit with dumplings to you, which it is; it is also essentially the same as the slump; and is presumably the antecedent of the cobbler and the dowdy. The latter contain essentially the same ingredients as the grunt and slump but rather than being steamed, they are baked to a golden brown in that more modern device, the oven. The cobbler is served as is; the crust of the dowdy is "dowdied," or broken up and mixed into the fruit and cooked further.

Melt butter, stir in cocoa powder, and set aside to cool.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs for 3 minutes, then gradually add sugar, beating 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir in butter/chocolate mixture. Gently fold in flour, walnuts and salt; don't beat.

Pour batter into two greased and floured 9-inch-round cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.

Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean; do not overbake.

Cool cake in pans 5 minutes, then turn onto wire racks to cool completely.

Whip cream until it begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually beat in brown sugar, confectioners' sugar and instant coffee. Continue beating until stiff peaks form.

Spread whipped cream atop one cake layer, top with the second layer, and use remaining cream to completely cover top and sides of cake. Garnish the top of the cake with chocolate chips or sprinkles. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or overnight, before serving. Serves 12 to 15

In mixer bowl, add water, whole wheat flour, wheat germ, soy flour, molasses, salt, yogurt, instant yeast, bread flour and 3 cups bread flour.
Mix on speed 2 until ingredients are incorporated. Continue kneading and add bread flour in small quantities until dough clears bowl. Allow mixer to knead for a minute or 2.
Remove dough from bowl , form a ball, and place in a greased bowl, turning
both to grease all sides.
Allow to rise till doubled
Deflate gently and remove dough from bowl Divide dough into 4 pieces
Form each unit of dough into a ball and allow to rest for 5 minutes before
proceding to form loaves.
With each unit, flatten ball, then jelly-roll. Seal seam and press ends to form an oval.
Place dough on a greased cookie sheet or on parchment paper with corn meal. Place seam side down. Place 3 inches apart. Allow to rise till doubled.
Hothing is needed for a glaze, but egg wash will give it a desirable appearance.
Bake in a preheated oven (375 F) for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool completly before wrapping in plastic wrap and freezing. This freezes quite well and retains
a very good wheatty flavor after a room temperature defrost

NOTES : If using a Kitchen Aid mixer this recipe will require a Heavy Duty
(325 w) model or stronger.

Weight and form of each loaf can be completely individual. I personally chose Free-form, but loaf pans could work properly. By weight for an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 would be recommended at 18 oz.

  1 1/2           cups  water
  2        Tablespoons  honey
  2        Tablespoons  shortening
     3/4           cup  cracked wheat cereal -- soaked, see below
  1                cup  flour, whole-grain wheat

  2        Tablespoons  powdered milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast

(Not in the recipe, but important to do: Pour boiling water over cracked wheat and let it soak for 1/2 an hour so the kernels are not so hard in the bread. I discard the hot water before adding the wheat to the bread and use fresh water in the bread so the temperature has no chance to affect the yeast. The small amount of water added by the soaking has never affected the bread in any detrimental way.)

I substitute margarine for the shortening.

Measure ingredients listed in order called for by your bread machine. Select Whole Grain Setting (Oster machine #5). Press start.

                          Cranberry Nut Muffins

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1                cup  dried cranberries
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- melted
  2                     eggs

Preheat your oven to 500F

Mixing the dry ingredients:
Blend together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) as long and as vigorously as you want. Continue until all dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Add the berries and nuts, and stir them until they are evenly coated with the dry ingredients.

Mixing the liquid ingredients:
In a separate bowl, beat the liquid ingredients together until they are light.

Mixing the liquid and the dry:
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Here's where you have to restrain yourself. Take a fork or wire whisk and blend the two for 20 seconds and no more. The secret to light and tender muffins lies in this final blending. It 's okay if you've left some lumps that look as if they want more stirring. They really don't. So, no matter how hard it is, resist the impulse.

Baking:
Fill the cups of a lightly greased, 12-cup muffin tin three-quarters full. As soon as the muffins are in the oven, DROP THE TEMPERATURE TO 400 DEGREES (this is important). Bake for about 20 minutes or until they're a lovely, golden brown. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. Best served warm.

When you put muffins in a very hot oven initially and then immediately drop the temperature, you help create the peaks that make them so appealing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh jalapeno peppers (or one small can -- drained)
                        (2 to 3)
                        chopped jalapeno peppers
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- (1 package)
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1              small  onion -- finely diced
  2          teaspoons  ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce (optional)
  2        tablespoons  Instant Clearjel(r)

Seed and chop the fresh chilies, or drain the canned ones. Mash the cream cheese to soften, beat in the egg, then stir in the remaining ingredients, mixing just till everything is thoroughly combined. The more air you beat in, the more the cheese mixture expands and the more chance of it exploding out the side of your appetizer. Yield: enough filling for 24 appetizers

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1                cup  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, then stir in the sour cream. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly greased work surface and knead it briefly, just until it holds together. Roll it into a 12 x 16-inch rectangle, fold in three (like a business letter), flip the dough over and give it a 90 turn, and repeat the rolling and folding process. Wrap tightly, and chill for several hours, or overnight.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and unwrap it. In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle both sides of the dough with the cinnamon sugar, and roll it into a 12 x 16-inch rectangle, sprinkling with additional sugar as needed to keep the dough from sticking. Sprinkle any remaining sugar over the dough when you're done rolling, passing the rolling pin over the sugar to "grind" some of it into the dough.

Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a log, and slice it into approximately 48 1/3-inch slices. Place the slices on a parchment-lined or very lightly greased baking pan. Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 8 minutes, until the sugar has melted on the bottom, then turn over and bake for 5 minutes longer, for a very crisp cookie. If you like a softer cookie, bake for 10 to 12 minutes without turning. The bottoms will be caramelized, and the tops soft. Cool on the baking pan for 3 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Store for up 2 weeks in an airtight container. Yield: about forty-eight 1 1/2- to 2-inch cookies.

NOTES : The recipe title above is written strictly tongue in cheek; we've been laughing recently about ads we've seen for "croissant bagel rolls," which is totally oxymoronic. Rich, tender, buttery croissant dough is about as far as you can get from the plain, fat-free straight dough you use to make bagels; and a roll is somewhere in between the two. How can you possibly market a product that's all three, and still do justice to any one of them?

But another ad (we're avid readers of professional bakery magazines) left our mouths watering. The photo showed a cinnamon sticky bun ostensibly made with croissant dough, a deep-brown whorl of cinnamon filling enclosed by tender, flaky dough. Well, we tried to turn that picture into reality, and failed; somehow, the croissant dough was just too tough and chewy when rolled with the cinnamon filling. But puff paste seemed like it might do the trick. Not wanting to spend the time on "real" puff paste with its folds and turns, we opted for Maida Heatter's "counterfeit" version, a simple sour cream and butter dough that, while marginally less rich and flaky than "the real thing," tasted fine to us. Voila! While the resulting product was more cookie than roll, it was certainly tasty, and can find a home in our picnic basket any time; along with fresh fruit, it's a nice, light dessert.

Sue says these cookies (rolls? pastries?) are remarkably similar to rugalach she's eaten at a friend's house. If you like raisins, a more traditional filling would have ground raisins added to the cinnamon-sugar.

      Crostini With Basil, Garlic, Goat Cheese And Sun-Dried Tomato

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Crostini
  2          teaspoons  active dry or instant yeast
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/4           cups  lukewarm water
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Topping:
  1            package  goat cheese (plain or herbed) -- (16 ounces)
  3               cups  loosely packed fresh basil leaves
  1              heads  fresh garlic -- cloves separated,
                        peeled, and thinly sliced (1 to 1 1/2)
  2               cups  sun-dried tomato slices packed in oil -- (about 9 to 14 ounces) 
  						 -- drained (snipped in half if large   (2 to 3)

Crostini: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Dough, and press Start. Check the dough 10 minutes before the end of the second knead cycle; it should be extremely soft and sticky. Adjust the consistency as necessary with flour or water.

When the machine has completed its cycle; transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface. Divide it into three pieces. If you're using a baguette pan, grease the molds of the pan, and sprinkle them with coarse semolina or yellow cornmeal. Working with one piece at a time, lay the dough in the pan and stretch and pat it to within 1 inch of each end. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. If you're not using a baguette pan, roll the dough as best you can into three 16-inch logs, and place them on a couple of lightly oiled cookie sheets.

Cover the dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap, and set aside to rise until it's very puffy, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When the bread has risen, bake it in a preheated 425F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it's golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. When the bread is cool, drape it with a cloth towel and let it rest overnight; it needs to be a bit stale before you cut it.

Slice the bread crosswise into 1/3-inch rounds. Pour a generous coating of olive oil (about 1/8-inch) into a couple of half-sheet pans, or two large cookie sheets with sides; use your fingers to spread the oil completely over the bottom of the pans. Put the bread slices into the pans in one layer, as close together as you can get them. Drizzle the slices lightly with olive oil, and bake them in a preheated 275F oven for 45 minutes, or until they're very dry and are just beginning to brown. Remove the crostini from the oven, and let them cool. If not serving them the same day, store the crostini in an airtight container.

Just before serving, use the following topping to complete the crostini. Serve as an appetizer, or as part of a large antipasto. Yield: about 9 dozen crostini, enough to serve 16 people

The Topping

Note that all of the amounts are approximate. You'll use more or less depending on a variety of factors, including how big the basil leaves and tomatoes are, how thinly you slice the garlic, and how generous you are with the cheese. To say nothing of how many crostini you've sampled before even getting to the topping... If you find yourself with leftover topping ingredients, make salad.

Unwrap the goat cheese, and gently crumble it into a small bowl. Spread each crostini with 1 teaspoon of cheese, then top with a basil leaf, a slice or slices of garlic, and a sun-dried tomato slice, cut in half if overly large. Serve immediately; the crostini will get soggy if they wait more than about half an hour.

NOTES : A coarse-grained bread with lots of large, uneven holes -- a typical Italian or French loaf -- comes from dough which is very slack, or wet. It's simple to make a slack dough in the bread machine; you never have to knead it by hand, so you don't have to deal with sticky fingers. This dough should never form a ball which cleans the sides of the pan, but should remain sticky; it'll mound up as if trying to form a ball, but it won't.

The best way to make bread for crostini is in French baguette pans. The resulting loaves, long and skinny, when sliced into thin rounds make bite-sized crostini, ideal for appetizers. Simply grease the pans, and scoop the dough into them, stretching and patting it to fit with your lightly greased fingers. There's no need to try to roll the dough into a log and transfer it to the pan; though the stretching and patting method makes a messy looking loaf at first, once it's risen and baked it'll be as smooth as any shaped loaf.

  1         tablespoon  non-melting white sugar* -- confectioners'
                        sugar or glazing sugar*, for dusting cake
                        after removing from oven. (1 to 2)

Cake: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat together the butter or margarine, salt and sugar for 2 to 3 minutes, till smooth. Add the eggs, beating well after each addition; continue beating after adding the last egg for at least 3 minutes at medium-high speed. The batter should look fluffy, with no grains of sugar visible.

In a separate bowl, sift or whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and lemon oil or peel. Combine the buttermilk, yogurt or sour cream with the vanilla and sweet dough flavoring (if you're using it).

Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, and beat to combine. Add the buttermilk/yogurt/sour cream mixture, stirring until well-blended. Pour the batter into a greased 9 x 9-inch square inch cake pan. Sprinkle the blueberries (if you're using them) over the cake and bake in a preheated 325F oven for 25 minutes.

Topping: Prepare the topping while the cake is baking. Cut the butter and shortening into the flour, sugar, salt and flavorings. To make large crumbs, work the mixture with your fingers till it makes large balls; for finer crumbs, leave as is. After the cake has baked for 25 minutes, gently take it out of the oven and sprinkle with the crumbs. You don't want it to fall, so work quickly and gently. Return the cake to the oven and bake for about 20 minutes more. Remove it from the oven when a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with non-melting white sugar, glazing sugar or confectioners' sugar, and let cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving. Yield: 9 large 3-inch servings.

     1/2           cup  prepared salsa
  8             ounces  cream cheese
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese
  1              bunch  scallions -- sliced (about 1/4
                        cup)*
  1            package  frozen -- (10 ounce) chopped
                        spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry

*Use the white part and part of the green, about 4 inches total of each scallion.

Waffles: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs and melted butter or oil. In a separate bowl, blend together the dry ingredients, then quickly and gently combine the wet and dry ingredients. Let the batter sit for 10 minutes, to allow the cornmeal to soften. Drop the batter by 1/3-cupfuls onto a hot waffle iron, and bake until the waffle iron stops steaming. Yield: about ten 8-inch round waffles.

Chili Con Queso: Heat together, over low heat, the salsa, cream cheese and grated cheese, cooking and stirring until the mixture is smooth. Stir in the chopped spinach and scallions. Serve in a fondue pot or chafing dish to keep the mixture fluid; it'll thicken as it cools. Refrigerate any leftover sauce; it makes a wonderful dip for tortilla chips, or spread for a wrap sandwich.

NOTES : These cornmeal waffles are good if made without the Mexican spices and eaten with syrup, but even better made spicy and served with a simple chili con queso dip. Leave out the "optional" ingredients if serving the waffles with berries, fruit compote or syrup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Poolish (Starter):
  1                cup  cool water -- about 65F
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/4      teaspoon  instant yeast -- (a pinch) such as
                        SAF
                        Dough:
     1/2           cup  cool water -- about 65F
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (2 to 2
     1/2                )
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast(remainder of yeast packet -- if using
                        one)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt

For the poolish: Combine all poolish ingredients, mixing just till a cohesive dough forms. Allow the dough to rest, covered, for 12 to 16 hours at room temperature. When the poolish is ready, it will be filled with large holes and bubbles.

Add the water to the poolish, and mix till smooth. Add the flour, yeast and salt, and knead the dough till it's fairly smooth but not necessarily elastic, about 3 minutes by machine, or 5 minutes by hand. (The gluten will continue to develop as the dough rises, so you don't want to develop it fully during the kneading process.)

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, for 1 1/2 hours. To help develop the gluten and distribute the yeast's food, turn the dough twice during the rising time: gently fold all four sides into the middle, and turn the dough over.

Divide dough in thirds, and roll each third into a 20-inch-long rope. Braid ropes. Set braid on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until just puffy. Gently brush braid with beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake bread in a preheated 425F oven for 25 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 1 loaf

  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chopped crystallized ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric (optional -- for color)
  5        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  cold butter or margarine -- (1 stick) cut into
                        eight pieces
     1/2           cup  cooked -- pureed pumpkin or
                        squash (canned is fine)
  1                cup  buttermilk -- plain yogurt or

This gorgeous saffron-colored loaf is great served with fresh veggies and humus at parties. It also makes a delicious sandwich. To lower your fat intake, hold the mayo and try yogurt instead.

Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Program the machine for basic bread, light setting, and press Start. Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a smooht, slightly sticky ball of dough. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Remove the bread when it's done, and let it cool completely before slicing.

Yield: 1 loaf

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Beat the egg and yolk, sugar and salt together. In a double boiler, or very
carefully in a saucepan, barely heat the milk. Pour a little into the egg mixture, blend it together and pour this back into the saucepan. Cook slowly, stirring with a wire whisk without letting it come to a boil or it will curdle. When it begins to thicken, remove the pan from heat and stir occasionally to cool it and prevent it from developing a skin. When it's almost cool, add your choice of flavoring. (If it should curdle, you can whirl it in a blender and fool just about everyone.) Serve warm over a chilled Charlotte.

Just A Hint...
Throughout the year, and during the Dog Days of August particularly, it's important to refrigerate fruit desserts containing eggs, custard or dairy-based fillings, such as sour cream pies or cream cheese-filled tarts. Bacteria loves to grow in eggs and dairy products, and it loves heat; to prevent food poisoning this summer, be sure to keep those creamy desserts in the fridge!

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Food Processor
                Hand Made                       White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1                cup  warm water
  2 1/4           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (2 1/4
                        to 2 3/4)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt

You can make this bread dough in a number of different ways. The simplest, by far, is in a food processor using the plastic dough blade. Pour the warm water into the processor and sprinkle the yeast and sugar on top. Put the lid on the processor and pulse for a split second, just to wet the yeast. Add 1 cup of the flour, process for 10 seconds, and let rest for 10 minutes. This gets the yeast going, lets the flour start to absorb the liquid, and is a good time to do the breakfast dishes.

Add the remaining flour, between 1 1/4 and 1 3/4 cups, and process for 1 minute. You'll need about 1 1/4 cups in the winter, 1 1/3 cups in the summer, and 1 1/2 cups in the spring or fall; because flour absorbs moisture from the air, and the air is moister in summer than winter, the amount of flour you'll need in your bread recipes will be less in winter, more in summer. You're trying to attain a very slack dough, one which will barely form a rough ball in the food processor.

Remove the dough from the food processor bowl, place it in a large, lightly greased bowl, and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap. Set aside and go on about your work.

You can also make this dough in a mixer, such as a Kitchen Aid, or even a smaller stand mixer, using either a dough hook or dough "beaters." Follow the same procedure outlined above.

Guess what? You can even do this in your bread machine. Simply put all the ingredients in at once, let the machine go through its first knead (25 minutes or so), then take the dough out of the machine and put it into a lightly greased bowl. Reset (turn off) the machine.

Finally you can do this with -- gulp! -- your hands. Combine the ingredients with a spoon, then knead it with my hands in the bowl for 1 minute.

Ten or 12 hours later, or when you get back to it, take the dough out of the bowl and make it into whatever you want. You'll have enough dough to make eight rolls, eight chewy, substantial breadsticks, one Italian-style loaf or baguette, one round loaf, or a 12-inch focaccia. I usually opt for the focaccia, drizzling it with olive oil, then sprinkling it with a healthy amount of black pepper, a bit of salt, and some rosemary.

Let the dough rise again, for an hour or so, until whatever you've shaped is good and puffy. Preheat the oven to 450F about half an hour before you want to bake the bread.

Bake the bread for 15 to 20 minutes, misting the inside of the oven with cold water from a clean plant mister three or four times during the first 5 to 8 minutes of baking, if you're after a very crisp crust. Remove the bread from the oven when it's golden brown, and cool it on a wire rack or bring it to the table and eat it immediately

As you can see, this bread is basically non-fat, and very low-calorie if you don't gild it with butter, garlic oil, etc. However, this bread cries to be dunked in a seasoned olive oil. Think of it this way: it's perfectly healthful and nutritious to begin with, and you do need a bit of fat in your diet, and olive oil, being preponderantly monounsaturated, is arguably the best kind of fat you can eat. Go for it!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        SPONGE
  1                cup  warm tap water
                        -- (about 110 degrees)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast -- (1 envelope)
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        ---
                        DOUGH
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (1/2 to 3/4)
  1                cup  medium or whole-grain rye flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  ground caraway seeds
  1         tablespoon  whole caraway seeds
  1         tablespoon  unsulfured molasses
  1         tablespoon  vegetable or olive oil
                        All the sponge -- above

One cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan dusted with cornmeal

ONE LARGE OVAL LOAF


The secret of the rich rye flavor of this bread is the addition to the dough of ground, as well as whole, caraway seeds. 	"Ground caraway is sometimes available in health food stores. If you can't find it already ground, grind the seeds with a mortar and pestle, spice grinder, or clean coffee grinder.

1. To make the sponge, place the water in a mixing bowl and whisk in the yeast. Stir in the flour smoothly, then cover with plastic wrap and let the sponge rise until tripled in volume and very bubbly, about 3 hours.

2. To mix the dough by machine, place the 1/2 cup of flour, remaining ingredients, and the sponge in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. Mix with a dough hook on low speed for about 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. If the dough is very soft, add the remaining flour, a tablespoon at a time, continuing to mix until the dough is smooth and elastic.

To mix the dough in a food processor, place the sponge, 1/2 cup of flour, and remaining ingredients in a work bowl fitted with a metal blade. Pulse repeatedly until the dough forms a ball (if the dough will not form a ball, add the remaining flour, a tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough forms a ball). Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then let the machine run continuously for 20 seconds.

3. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl (you may need the help of a scraper) and turn the dough over so the top is oiled. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise at room temperature until the dough has doubled, about 1 hour. If you wish to interrupt the process, let the dough begin to rise, then punch down, cover tightly, and refrigerate. To proceed, bring the dough back to room temperature until the dough begins rising again.

4. After the dough has risen, punch it down, form it into a ball, and return it to the bowl; cover and let rise until doubled again, about 1 hour.

5. To form a loaf, turn the dough out onto a work surface and deflate the dough. Form the dough into a even ball by pushing and tucking toward the center all around the bottom. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Flour your hands and roll the loaf, pressing on the center with your palms, and rolling it back and forth to elongate it slightly. Place the oval on the prepared pan and cover with oiled plastic wrap or a towel. Allow to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

6. About 30 minutes before you intend to bake the loaf, set the racks at the middle and lowest levels of the oven and preheat to 500F. Set a pan on the lowest rack to absorb some of the excess bottom heat and keep the bottom of the loaf from burning.

7. Place the loaf in the oven and lower the temperature to 450F.
 After the loaf has baked for 20 minutes and is completely risen, lower the temperature to 350F and continue baking for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the bread is well risen and a dark golden color. It should reach an internal temperature of about 210F.
"8. Remove the loaf from the oven and cool on a rack.

SERVING: Slice the bread about 1/2 inch thick, or a little thinner for sandwiches, with a sharp serrated knife.

STORAGE: On the day it is baked, keep the bread loosely covered at room temperature. For longer storage, wrap in plastic and freeze for up to 1 month.

VARIATION
"LIGHT RYE BREAD: For a milder flavor, omit the ground caraway and molasses.

NOTES : You could add raisins and other seeds (such as the Williams Sonoma Four Seed Baking Blend, which lists on the label poppy, sesame, caraway, and fennel seeds) on your own, and perhaps bake the bread in a pullman pan to get the square shape you're after.

NOTES : This quickbread, because it's so moist and dense, won't dome up as it bakes; it'll remain flat across the top, and may even sink a bit in the center. But that's the nature of the beast; once it's cut in slices, it's shape won't be important. Since it keeps well, and even improves in flavor after a couple of days, we suggest making this loaf on Friday, if you're hosting a Sunday brunch. Wrap it well in plastic wrap, and store it at room temperature. Just before serving, slice it in thin pieces, and array the pieces on a plate with other quickbreads, or in a basket.

Mix white flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Beat in the date goo with a heavy duty mixer or by hand. Add the remaining flours and knead by machine or by hand until the dates have nearly disappeared and the dough is elastic.

Let rise in the bowl until doubled; deflate and let rise again. Divide and shape into two loaves. Bake in a preheated oven at 325F about an hour.

                            Dessert Tortillas

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Tortillas
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/4           cup  butter -- (1/2 stick) softened
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water -- (1/2 to 3/4)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        Topping and Filling
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        cinnamon-sugar
                        berries -- if desired

Manual Method: In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the flour and the oil. Gradually mix in the water and salt. Knead briefly, just until the dough is smooth.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine, program for Manual or Dough, and press Start. Cancel the machine and remove the dough when it's smooth, after about 5 minutes of kneading.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Round them into balls, flatten slightly, and allow them to rest, covered, for at least 30 minutes. This resting period improves the texture of the dough by giving the flour time to absorb the water, and it also gives the gluten time to relax, making the tortillas easier to roll out.

Preheat an ungreased cast iron griddle or heavy frying pan over medium heat. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll it out until it's about 8 inches in diameter. Fry the tortilla in the ungreased pan for about 45 seconds on each side. (Or, if you have a tortilla baker -- use it!). For storing tortillas longer than a couple of days, refrigerate or freeze them.

Assembly: Brush each tortilla with a bit of melted butter and sprinkle with some cinnamon-sugar. Turn the tortillas over, and add some berries, if desired -- blueberries, blackberries or raspberries work particularly well. Roll up the prepared tortillas (the butter and sugar will be on the outside), and place them on a lightly greased cookie sheet; line them up next to one another to keep them from unrolling.

Bake the tortillas in a preheated 375 F. oven for 10 minutes, until some of the sugar has caramelized on the bottom and the top is crisp and brown. Eat hot! Yield: 8 tortillas

NOTES : The following sweet tortilla recipe is not deep-fried, like those you'll find at a fast-food restaurant. Chewy rather than crunchy, these tortillas are still yummy; they're kind of like rolled-up cinnamon toast, and are wonderful eaten side-by-side with a dish of vanilla ice cream. At this time of year, we like to fill them with berries before baking; the berries soften and warm a bit as they bake, and team well with the cinnamon-y tortillas.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water -- 105 to 110F
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast
  2          teaspoons  sugar

     1/2           cup  semolina
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil or garlic oil
                        Creamy Mushroom and Leek Filling:
  3               cups  sliced mushrooms (1/16 to 1/8-inch thick)
  2             medium  leeks -- white parts and
                        tender green parts only, sliced 1/8-inch
                        thick
  4              small  red potatoes -- skins on, sliced
    1/16                to 1/8-inch thick
  2        tablespoons  olive oil or garlic oil -- (2 to 3)
  1            package  Neufchatel or cream cheese -- (3 ounce) at room
                        temperature
                        freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
                        red onion slices -- for topping
  1         tablespoon  fresh chives -- snipped into
  1             pieces  , for garnish
                        Savory Spinach and Tomato Filling:
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach -- (10 ounce) thawed
                        and squeezed dry
  1              small  yellow onion -- diced into 1/4-inch
  1             pieces  and sauteed until softened in 2
  1          teaspoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  olive oil or garlic oil
  1 1/2           cups  part-skim ricotta cheese
     3/4           cup  freshly grated Parmesan cheese -- divided
  1                     plum tomato -- cut into 1/4-inch
                pieces
  12             large  fresh basil leaves -- snipped into pieces
  4             cloves  garlic -- finely minced
                        freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  feta cheese -- crumbled
  2                     plum tomatoes -- cut into 1/4-inch
                rounds

Dough: Combine all of the ingredients to make a smooth, supple dough, using your electric mixer, bread machine or hands. The dough will be a bit on the soft side, but should not be sticky. Transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Or, let it complete its dough cycle in the bread machine. Prepare the filling while the dough is rising.

Deflate the dough gently and let it rest for several minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to a scant 14-inch round. If the dough resists you, cover it for a few minutes and return to find it more relaxed. It's important to roll the dough this thin because otherwise the crust will be too thick and "bready."

Preheat the oven to 400F. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a cornmeal-sprinkled, perforated baker's disk or upside-down pizza pan. Spread one of the following two fillings over the center of the dough (see specific directions as follows), being sure to leave a 1 1/2 to 2-inch border. Fold the untopped border of the dough towards the middle to partially cover the topping, arranging the folds as neatly or haphazardly in pleats or crimps as you wish.

Bake the galette for 20 to 25 minutes (on a baking stone, if possible), or until the filling is hot and the crust is golden. Let cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving, warm or cold. Yield: dough for one galette.

For the Creamy Mushroom and Leek Filling: Saute the mushrooms, leeks and potatoes separately in olive oil, until softened but not mushy. Set each ingredient aside to cool.

Combine the mushrooms and leeks with the cheese and black pepper in a small bowl. Cut the potato rounds in half and arrange them over the rolled-out dough in as flat a layer as possible. Sprinkle the minced garlic evenly over the potatoes. Spread the mushroom filling over the top and garnish with the red onion rings. Finish as directed above. Sprinkle the fresh chives over the top just before serving. Yield: filling for one galette, 6 servings

For the Savory Spinach and Tomato Filling: Combine the spinach, sauteed onion, oil, ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan, chopped plum tomato, basil, garlic and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well. Spread this filling onto the rolled-out dough. Top with the crumbled feta.

Arrange the sliced tomatoes in circles or other decorative patterns over the feta and sprinkle on the remaining 1/4 cup grated Parmesan. Finish as directed above. Yield: filling for one galette, 8 servings

NOTES : Once you've seen one, you'll want to make your own, which is exactly what we've set out to do here. These elegant, free-form meals in a pouch most closely resemble open-faced calzones, but since their appearance is really more refined, each shall go by the name of galette, the French word that encompasses tarts of all types.

Portable enough for a picnic basket and classy enough for a dinner party or backyard hors d'oeuvres fest, these stuffed summer yeast breads are equal parts delicious and colorful, satisfying and hearty. The filling is voluminous and the bread a tender envelope, so be careful when moving the unbaked creation (unless leaks don't bother you).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1         tablespoon  instant yeast*
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  mashed potato
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  dill seed or dried dill weed or a
                        combination of the two
     1/3           cup  minced dried onion

*If you prefer to use active dry yeast, be aware that rolls will need to rise about 1 1/2 hours instead of 45 minutes.

Manual Method: Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix until a soft, smooth dough forms, adding additional water or flour as needed, then knead, by hand or with the machine's dough hook, for about 10 minutes. Set the dough aside to rest, covered, for 10 minutes.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Dough or Manual, and press Start. After the machine has completed its kneading cycle(s), remove the dough from the machine and set it aside to rest, covered, for 10 minutes (don't let it go through the rise cycle).

Shaping and Baking: Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, and place the balls, evenly spaced, in two lightly greased 8-inch round cake pans. Tent the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap and allow the rolls to rise till they've filled the pan, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Bake the rolls in a preheated 350F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the pan, and brush them with melted butter or margarine, if desired. Yield: 16 rolls

Mix together. Keep in airtight container. Can refrigerate or not. I don't.  Use 1 teaspoon per cup of flour.  I use this in all my breads. It doesn't contain gluten, because gluten is not "one size fits all". So, you can add your own, or not, depending on the bread type. Simple white breads made with bread flour probably don't need any extra gluten, whereby heavy whole grains do ( unless you LIKE  to eat doorstops!)

The main advantage to using the enhancer I have found is the improvement of the bread's texture. If you like a tender, "softer" crumb, this will definitely do it!

NOTES : This is the recipe I use for dough enhancers. Seems to do a great job. I think the most essential ingredients are the lecithin and diastolic malt.  Of late, I have also started adding 1 teaspoon of bottled lemon juice to the liquids and that really seems to give the yeast a boost.

2.  Thoroughly mix all dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl (you know, your old favorite).  Add buttermilk and stir until the batter is stiff but not yet kneadable.  Do not knead this dough.

3.  Cover the bowl with a damp towel, and let rise in the usual manner for 45 mnutes.

4.  Preheat the oven to 400F.

5.  Spoon out the dough, dividing equally, into the two pans.

6.  Let rise for about 30 minutes.

7.  Bake for about 25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 180F taken with an instant thermometer (You don't have one?  Get one.)

8.  Remove bread from pans and let cool on a rack.

This bread freezes very well.

                 *****

Here is a "trick" I learned from my grandmother who "toasted" all whole grains before grinding them and also "toasted" already ground meal and flour prior to using them in bread/rolls, etc. Spread the grain (or flour) about 1/2 inch deep in a baking pan and place in a medium oven - using a broad spatula, stir the grain every 8 minutes or so, end to end and side to side. If flour, remove from oven just when you begin to see a slight beige color develop - usually 20 to 25 minutes. Grain will take a bit longer, perhaps 35 to 45 minutes.
Larger grains such as barley may take even longer. You can also toast the grains on top of the stove in a cast iron pan but it has to be absolutely dry, no grease residue at all and you need a really big pan and have to stir constantly. This toasting enhances the flavor of any grain or seed - amaranth, sesame, teff, triticale, corn, etc. particularly if the grain has perhaps been stored a bit too long and is slightly stale. You may also toast rolled or steel cut oats, wheat bulgar, and all kinds of nuts.

I make a chestnut bread using chestnuts that have been steamed, roasted, then dried and ground into flour. A lot of work, but a heavenly taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  2               cups  hot water

  6               cups  flour -- (6 to 6 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  salt

Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour hot water over sugar and butter. Add 2 cups flour, beating as hard as possible after each addition. When mixture is warm, not hot, add to dissolved yeast. Add balance of flour, to which you've added the salt. Knead well. [Keep dough as soft as possible. - Ron] Place in a greased bowl and let rise until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Shape dough into rolls or buns, let rise again until double, then bake for about 13 to 20 minutes. Makes 20 to 24 rolls. [I find it makes many more than that. It all depends on the size and shape of the rolls you choose to make.

NOTES : These rolls are easy to make.  The recipe makes a lot, but around here they only last two days unless I freeze some before they're devoured. They are _best_ fresh but freeze well; if you can't freeze them, they'll still be tasty two days later anyway.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1                cup  warm water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour
  2 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        --
                        (approximately)
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil -- to drizzle on the
                        focaccia after baking

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Add 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour. Stir with a whisk and let this sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to get going.

Add the salt and the whole wheat flour. Add the rest of the all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is pulling away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead it, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough has formed a smooth ball. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rise in a draft-free place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down, and turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Stretch the dough into a 14-inch circle and place on a greased baking sheet. Let it rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425F while the focaccia is rising. Dimple it with your fingers and place it in the oven. Bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Drizzle with the olive oil. Cut into 6 wedges and serve topped with frittata and tomato sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge Starter (Begin 2 to 16 hours ahead)
  1                cup  cool-lukewarm water -- preferably spring
                        water (90 to 100F)
     1/2      teaspoon  active dry or instant yeast
  1 1/4           cups  Special For Machines Bread Flour
     1/4           cup  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or
                        Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour
                        Dough
                        All of the sponge starter (above)
  1                cup  lukewarm water -- preferably spring
                        water (l00 to 115F)
     3/4      teaspoon  active dry or 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3 3/4           cups  Special For Machines Bread Flour -- (3 3/4 to 4)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt

To Make The Sponge: Stir all of the sponge ingredients together to make a thick, pudding-like mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and leave on a counter overnight or for at least 2 to 4 hours. If you're making this in a bread machine, place the sponge ingredients inside, and turn the machine on for just a few seconds to mix the ingredients together. Turn the machine off and close the cover. Let the sponge rest for 4 hours or overnight (anywhere between 2 and 16 hours is fine, the longer the better).

To Make The Dough: Stir down the sponge with a spoon and add the water, yeast, sugar, most of the flour (hold back about 1/2 cup to use if required), and salt. Knead the dough, adding more flour as necessary, to make a soft dough, 10 to 12 minutes. Note: You may also do this in your bread machine, using the Dough or Manual setting. After the dough has finished kneading, place it in a lightly greased bowl, and continue as directed below.

Big Tip: Mix ingredients together using up to 80% of the flour called for. Mix into a loose, messy mass. Let the dough rest for 12 minutes. Then continue, kneading and adding additional flour as required. Overall, the dough handles better, having had a chance to absorb the flour while resting and relaxing, and you'll tend to add less flour.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or plastic container, cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and a damp towel, and let it rise until almost doubled (depending on the weather, this could be l to 2 hours). If you're going out, or if you prefer, let the dough rise slowly in the fridge. If your dough has been refrigerated, allow it to come to room temperature; it'll warm up and rise at the same time. After its first rise, deflate the dough gently, but don't knock out all the air; this will create those "holes" so important to French bread. Form the dough into a round ball. Place two cookie sheets atop one another, and place a semolina- or cornmeal-dusted piece of parchment paper on top. Gently place the ball of dough on the cookie sheets, seam-side down. Cover it lightly with a tea towel, and let it rise the second time until it's puffy and about 40% to 50% larger, anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes (depending on the weather, luck, and magic). Slash or cross-hatch the bread with a sharp knife or lame. Dust it with a little flour.

Preheat your grill to High. Place the bread (on the doubled-up cookie sheets) on the grill, and close the cover. Immediately reduce the heat to Medium (400F), and allow the bread to bake for 25 minutes, or until it's well-browned. Reduce the heat to Low, and carefully place the bread directly on the grill. Continue to bake until completely done, about 5 minutes.

For Regular (Oven) Baking: Preheat the oven to 475F. Slash the bread, spritz water into the oven with a clean plant mister, and place the bread in the oven. Reduce the heat to 425F and spritz with water every few minutes for the first 15 minutes of baking. Bake the bread for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until it tests done. Yield: 1 large round bread or two medium breads, 10 to 12 servings

NOTES : You could make this bread, and no other, for the rest of your baking career, and never feel cheated. It uses the sponge, or poolish, method: sort of a poor man's or woman's sourdough starter -- no feedings, little pre-planning, lots of flexibility and superb bread. I usually make this dough, sponge starter and all, in the bread machine, but you can do it by hand, processor, or stand mixer. After barbecue season, bake this bread in the conventional oven but atomize it with water to get that crisp crust. If you've always wanted crusty, hole-ridden, French-style bread, this is the ticket.

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cake
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1                cup  brown sugar
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  2              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
     3/4           cup  cocoa -- sifted after
                        measuring
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  baking powder

  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2               cups  brewed coffee (just warm)
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips -- (6 ounces) or
                        coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate
                        Topping
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips -- (6 ounces) or
                        coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate
  1                cup  white chocolate chips -- (6 ounces) or
                        coarsely chopped white chocolate

Cake: Preheat your oven to 350F. Generously grease a 10-inch bundt-style or tube pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine the white and brown sugars, the oil, eggs, and vanilla, and beat at medium speed for 1 minute, until smooth. In a medium-sized bowl combine the cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, salt and flour. Add the dry ingredients to the sugar and oil mixture alternately with the warm coffee, beating steadily to make a smooth, thin batter.

Spoon the batter into the pan, and sprinkle the chocolate chips on top. Use a spoon or your fingers to barely submerge the chips in the batter; they'll sink and float at random, which is OK.

Bake the cake for 60 to 72 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out dry and the top springs back when touched gently.

Topping: As soon as the cake is out of the oven, gently sprinkle it with the dark and white chocolate. Allow it to rest for several minutes to soften the chips, then swirl the chips onto the cake with a butter knife, spreading and smearing chocolate over the top of the cake. Loosen the sides of the cake from the pan, and allow it to cool. Remove it from the pan, and set it on a serving plate, iced-side up. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired. This cake keeps several days at room temperature, covered, and also freezes well. Yield: 12 to 16 servings

Optional Glaze: Instead of the chopped chocolate topping, allow the cake to cool for at least 20 minutes, then remove it from the pan. If it sticks, place the pan on a warm burner to loosen and release the cake. Melt the glaze ingredients (semisweet and white chocolates) in the top of a double boiler, then swirl them over the cooled cake.

NOTES : The challenge here is for a rich, moist cake that's dairy -- (butter and milk) free, but absolutely decadent and flavorful. The big bonus is that the cake takes literally only seconds to put together. Sometimes, I mix the dry ingredients the night before, and in the morning add the remaining ingredients.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  maple syrup (or molasses -- or even honey)
  2        tablespoons  butter or 2 tablespoons vegetable oil -- (1/4 stick)
  2          teaspoons  regular instant yeast
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour
  4               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (4 to 4
     1/2                )
  1 1/2         quarts  lard -- (3 pounds)
                        vegetable shortening or vegetable oil

Pour the water into a saucepan and sprinkle in the cornmeal. Stirring constantly, bring the water to a boil and remove it from the heat. Stir in the maple syrup. If you're using butter, add it now while the mixture is hot. Allow to cool a bit. Blend the yeast and salt with the whole wheat flour and stir it into the cornmeal mixture; then add the 2 tablespoons of oil, if you're using it. Add 4 cups of the all-purpose flour and mix until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.

Turn out onto a flour-sprinkled kneading surface and knead for 3 or 4 minutes. Add enough more flour to give the dough body, but not enough to make it stiff. Let the dough rest while you wash, clean out and grease the bowl. Knead the dough another 3 or 4 minutes, place it in the bowl, cover, and let rise until it's doubled in bulk.*

*If you're planning to make fried bread for breakfast, put the dough to rise in a cool place and leave it overnight. It will be ready for you in the morning.

To cook the dough, heat a large pan with vegetable oil that's 2 or 3 inches deep until it's reached 365F to 375F. Pull or cut off golf ball-sized pieces of dough (somewhere between 1 and 1 1/2 ounces each). Don't try to smooth them out -- ragged is better. Drop them gently into the oil, leaving space for expansion. Flip them over when they're golden on one side (sometimes they're reluctant to stay turned over, but a couple of forks can usually persuade them by force). When you think they're done, remove with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel. Tear one open just to make sure they're cooked all the way through; sometimes they're not and need another minute or so back in the pan. If your clientele can wait, accumulate a pile on a plate in a warm oven. Then serve them along with butter, maple syrup, and perhaps a sausage or two. Yield: about 3 dozen

NOTES : This is a recipe that I remember from my earliest years, and that we've made many times since. When I was a little girl, we spent a great deal of time in a little village in mid-Massachusetts where my grandfather was minister and where he and my grandmother "ministered" to most of the town in one way or another. Their house, which I continue to have very intense dreams about, was a typical New England farmhouse that flowed from the parlors in the front on the street, back through the dining room (and my grandfather's study, where he wrote his sermons) to the kitchen with its kitchen table, my grandmother's loom with its clattering sound that will always be tied to her kitchen, the large pantry on the left, and her old woodstove. -- PJH

NOTES : Cobbler is a distinctly American dish. Its name is said to come from the phrase "to cobble," meaning to patch something together roughly; to "cobble up," put something together in a hurry; or perhaps from the fact that the combination of fruit and dough on top of the dish looks like cobblestones.
Cobbler can be made with many different fruits, alone or in combination. Fruit is placed in a pan and a pastry crust, sweet batter, or biscuit dough is placed atop it; or batter is poured into the pan, and the fruit placed on top. Either way, the two end up mixing and mingling, the fruit mixture absorbing some of the cake-like dough, the dough absorbing the fruit juices, and the finished product resembling nothing so much as a very, very moist fruit cake.Variations in the crust are what differentiates most cobblers from one another. Originally, a cobbler's top crust was probably thick spoonfuls of biscuit dough, dumplings which cooked on top of the hot fruit layer (similar to "slumps" or

                        crust for 9" single-crust pie
                        milk
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk -- or any other type
                        milk (low-fat, whole, or cream)
  3                     eggs
  3        tablespoons  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- depending on
                        tartness of fruit (1/2 to 1)
     1/4      teaspoon  spice of your choice (cinnamon -- nutmeg, ginger,

  3               cups  berries -- left whole unless

Roll out pie crust and fit into a 9-inch pie pan. Trim edges and crimp or
flute decoratively. Coat inside of crust with a thin layer of milk.

In a mixing bowl, beat together buttermilk (or other type milk) and eggs. Beat in flour, sugar and spice.

Pour fruit into crust. Top with milk mixture. Bake pie on bottom shelf of a preheated 425F oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes, or until crust is golden. Remove pie from oven and cool completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

NOTES : Here's an easy variation on fruit pie. Using low-fat or skim- milk buttermilk will give you a lower-fat pie, while sweet milk or cream will result in a richer pie. This type of fruit pie really doesn't need any extra embellishment, such as whipped cream or ice cream; but nevertheless, we invite you to gild the lily in any way you see fit.

NOTES : These bars are a real life-saver when you have an abundance of fruit you don't quite know what to do with. Apples, bananas, peaches, pitted cherries, rhubarb, strawberries, blueberries, plums -- all lend themselves to this easy dessert. Cut in squares and serve warm, with whipped cream or ice cream, or let cool and cut into smaller bars to pack on a picnic. Simple as they are, these bars have never failed to draw praise from anyone who's tasted them.

NOTES : This fudgy dessert, with its crunchy, brownie-like top and gooey filling, has only 88 calories and 3.6 grams of fat per serving -- compare that to some of the "low-fat" desserts you'll find at the supermarket. See, you can have your homemade chocolate cake and eat it too! Chopped walnuts are a very good addition, though they do increase the fat grams and calories a bit, to 148 calories and 9 grams of fat with the addition of 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely chopped onions
  1 1/2           cups  chopped peppers (this can be one color or
                        a combination of colors)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  lukewarm (110F) water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  4               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2               cups  shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
                        coarse sea salt (optional)

Cook oil, onions and peppers slowly in a large skillet over medium-low heat until the onions are transparent. When you cook onions and peppers slowly, the natural sugars caramelize, and they become quite sweet. Set aside to cool to lukewarm.

In a large bowl, stir yeast into warm water to soften. Add salt, sugar, 2 cups flour, 1 cup cheese, and the cooled peppers. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes.

Gradually add flour, a little at a time, until you have a dough stiff enough to knead. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead, adding flour as necessary, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Put the dough into an oiled bowl. Turn once to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Knead in the remaining 1 cup cheese, leaving large streaks of the cheese visible. The streaks will toast and add an attractive look to the bread, not to mention a marvelous flavor.

Shape the dough into a ball. Flatten the top slightly, and place on a well-greased baking sheet. Cover with a towel and let rise for 45 minutes.

Just before baking, brush the tops of the loaves with cold water and sprinkle with coarse sea salt, if desired. Slit the loaf in three places, about 1/2-inch deep, across the top.

For added crispness, steam should be added to the oven for the first 10 minutes of baking. You can put 2 cups of ice cubes directly on the floor of your oven. By the time they have melted and evaporated the 10 minutes is usually up. Since some people have trouble working with this theory, you can also put a pan of boiling water on the bottom shelf of the oven and remove it after the first 10 minutes of baking. Just be sure to work quickly to prevent loss of oven heat.

Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 30 minutes, or until done. Immediately remove bread from baking sheet and cool on a rack. Makes 1 large loaf.

Note: This bread makes marvelous buns. When ready to shape, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball. Place about 3 inches apart on well-greased baking sheets. Flatten tops slightly. Just before baking, brush the top with cold water and sprinkle with coarse sea salt, if desired. Slit each bun twice across the top, about 1/4-inch deep. Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 18 minutes, or until done. Steam, as mentioned above, will make these buns extra crisp and crunchy.

NOTES : Fugassa bread is especially pretty when you use different colored peppers. Red, yellow and green create the best color, as black or dark purple peppers, when cooked, become a disappointing gray. Serve this hearty bread with cold meat or pasta salad or a refreshing chilled soup for a cool, easy summer meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough
  3               cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  active dry yeast
  2          teaspoons  malt extract or granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin or garlic-flavored olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  2               cups  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or
                        Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour
  7               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        --
                        (approximately)
                        Egg wash:
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh herbs such as basil and
                        oregano (optional)
  1              pinch  salt

Place the water in a large bowl and add the yeast and the malt. Add a cup of the all-purpose flour and stir with a whisk to break up any lumps. Let this sit for about 10 minutes, until it gets bubbly. During the summertime, this sponge will get going quickly.

Add the oil, the salt and the white whole wheat flour. Stir well and start to add the all-purpose flour, a cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has started to pull away from the sides of the bowl, turn it out onto a floured counter. Knead the dough, adding more flour as necessary, so that the dough isn't sticky. When the dough has formed a smooth ball, place it in a large oiled container to rise.

Cover the dough with a damp towel or plastic wrap and place it in a warm spot to rise. These days, almost everywhere is warm. If it's so hot that your dough rises dramatically in 45 minutes, you can punch it down and give it a second rising to develop flavor, or punch it down and refrigerate it until you're ready to use it. If you do refrigerate it, let the dough come to room temperature before you try to form it, otherwise it will tear.

Assuming that none of the above has happened, punch the dough down when it has doubled in size. This normally takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn it out of the rising container and onto a floured counter. Divide it into eight equal pieces. Roll each into an oval that is 1/4-inch thick, 10-inch wide and 14-inch long.

To make the calzone, place a generous 1/2 cup of filling on one side of the rolled-out dough. Top with 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Maintain a 1/2" border around the outside edge for sealing.

Beat together all of the ingredients for the egg wash. The addition of a pinch of salt helps to break down the egg white.

Using a pastry brush or your fingers, dab some of the egg wash around the edges of the dough. Fold the empty side over the filled side and press the edges of dough together. The better the seal, the less cheese will ooze out during baking.

Place each filled calzone on a greased baking sheet. Brush the tops with egg wash and cut a few steam vents in the top of each. Let the calzones rest for about 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 450F.

Bake the calzones for 10 minutes, then turn the heat down to 400F. Bake for an additional 20 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving. Yield: Eight calzones

NOTES : This is a hearty dinner that makes use of a lot of vegetables from the garden. If your spinach has already bolted, you can substitute steamed and drained or sauteed turnip or beet greens, or any other cooked greens. And if your peppers and tomatoes are hard, green, and 2 inches in diameter, anxiously awaiting the next 90 day, a trip to the produce stand or supermarket may be in order. The dough can be made early in the day and left to rise in the refrigerator. It freezes well if you feel like making a double batch and popping some in a heavy-duty plastic bag. You can also use the dough for tasty loaves or a pizza base.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Biga
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  instant yeast
                        Dough
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast
  1 1/2           cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  non-instant nonfat milk
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Topping
  1        medium head  garlic -- cloves separated
                        and peeled (about 2 ounces, about 15-20
                        cloves), finely minced*
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick) melted
     1/3           cup  olive oil -- (2 3/8 ounces)
  1              pinch  salt
  4             ounces  parmesan cheese -- cut in chunks and
                        grated (1 cup grated) parsley (if you
                        like)
                        -- A  mini food processor is an invaluable
                        -- tool for this task.

Manual/Mixer Method: In a small bowl, work together the biga ingredients -- 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast -- till they're well-combined, but not or kneaded. Cover the bowl, and allow the biga to rest overnight at room temperature.

Next day, combine the biga with the remaining dough ingredients in a large mixing bowl, stirring till the dough becomes cohesive, then kneading or stirring vigorously in the bowl till it becomes smooth. This is a very slack (wet) dough; don't try to add enough flour to make it kneadable on a work surface. If you have an electric mixer, knead it with the flat beater attachment for 5 to 8 minutes. If you're mixing by hand, use a bowl scraper and your hands to work it as best you can. It'll become smooth and will hold its shape somewhat, but will be very sticky. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise for 1 hour.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the biga ingredients into the pan your your bread machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. Cancel the machine as soon as the ingredients have formed a rough ball of dough, and all of the flour is incorporated.

Next day, add the remaining dough ingredients, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.

Shaping: Lightly grease a clean work surface, and transfer the dough to the greased work surface. Shape it into a rough 8 x 14-inch oval, and transfer it to a lightly greased baking sheet. (A half-sheet pan -- 18 x 13 inches -- is ideal for this. If you don't have a pan at least this large, divide the dough in half, make a couple of 4 x 14-inch ovals, and place them on two separate baking sheets.) Brush the top of the dough lightly with olive oil, and cover it; an acrylic dough cover is a great help here. If you use greased plastic wrap, it'll probably stick, so just be gentle pulling it off when the time comes.

Allow the dough to rise till it's very puffy and bubbly, about 3 hours at room temperature. Halfway through the rising time dimple the surface with your fingertips, assertively enough to leave marks, but not so vigorously that you deflate the dough completely.

Preheat the oven to 425F. Spritz the surface of the dough with warm water, and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes, till it's golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and allow it to cool. Wrap it loosely in plastic overnight, or in a paper bag.

Assembly: Prepare the topping by combining the minced garlic cloves, melted butter, olive oil and a pinch of salt. Just before serving, cut the bread (or the two loaves, if you've made two) in half lengthwise, like you're going to make a giant sandwich. Spread the cut halves with the garlic mixture. Bake the bread in a preheated 400F oven for about 10 minutes, or until the topping is bubbly and the edges of the bread are starting to brown. Remove the bread from the oven, and sprinkle it immediately with the grated Parmesan and parsley, if desired. Yield: about 24 servings



Description:
"For improved texture and flavor, we start the bread with a biga, simply a piece of dough prepared the day before you want to bake your bread. This is an overnight bread, so be sure to begin it the day before you want to serve it."

                Hand Made

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves (optional)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  diced candied ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  instant yeast
  1 3/4           cups  pumpkin*
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  butter -- (1/2 stick) melted
     1/2           cup  raisins (optional)

*Just plain pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.

Manual/Mixer Method: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, spices, sugar, ginger, salt and yeast, mixing till everything is well-distributed. In a separate bowl, stir together the pumpkin, eggs and melted butter till well-combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until the dough begins to come away from the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough with an electric mixer for 2 minutes; allow it to rest for 15 minutes, then continue kneading it for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, or until it's smooth. Add the raisins, and continue kneading just until they're incorporated.

If you're kneading by hand, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface; knead it for 3 minutes, allow it to rest for 15 minutes, then continue kneading till smooth, an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Add more flour sparingly, and only if the dough is absolutely impossible to work with by hand. Knead in the raisins right at the end.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set it aside to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours; it should be just about doubled in bulk.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients except the raisins into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. This dough may initially be a bit heavy for some machines; if necessary, use a spatula to help it get going. About 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, adjust the consistency of the dough with additional flour or water; it should be soft and smooth. About 4 to 5 minutes before the end of the kneading cycle, add the raisins. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface, divide it in half then divide each half into three pieces. Roll each piece into a 10-inch log.

Working with three logs at a time, place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Braid them together; be sure to pinch the ends together well, and tuck them under. Repeat with the remaining logs. Set the braids aside, covered with lightly greased plastic wrap or an acrylic dough-rising cover, to rise for 1 hour; they should look puffy, though not necessarily doubled in bulk.

Bake the bread in a preheated 375F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the braids from oven, and allow them to cool on a wire rack. Serve them warm or at room temperature. If any is left over after a few days, use bread to make bread pudding (recipe follows).Yield: two 10-inch braids.

NOTES : Maybe it's our lifelong familiarity with one of the holidays' cliche staples -- pumpkin pie -- but we can hardly imagine baking anything with pumpkin and not including ginger as one of the spices. Ginger and pumpkin are two flavors that just seem to go together, like apples and cinnamon. And they team beautifully in this bright-gold, moist, dense holiday bread. Serve it as the centerpiece of a bread basket at dinner, or with a creamy lunchtime soup.

  1           teaspoon  olive oil

Thoroughly mix the first 8 ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Blend the olive oil and water and pour into dry ingredients mixing with a wooden spoon. Turn out on a floured surface and knead until dough springs back when you stick your finger in it. Form into a ball and place in an oiled (olive, of course) bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1-1/2 hours or until doubled. Remove from bowl and knead briefly. Form into 2 batards and place in an oiled batard pan or on an oiled baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let rise for 1 hour. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375F (with a baking stone inside, if you have one). When dough has doubled in size, slash, and spritz the top with cold water. Spritz the inside of the oven as well. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the bread's inside temperature reaches 190F (using an instant thermometer). Let cool for about 30 minutes - if you can.

This recipe will also make 4 baguettes or a focaccia. Glorious!

NOTES : Granary Flour is a whole-wheat flour with added malt wheat flakes. AFAIK, it is only produced in England.

I have the following recipe for a substitute:mix 1 lb whole wheat flour, 6 oz bread flour and 6 oz cracked wheat.

It's a straight dough bread with the following recipe:

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  barley malt extract -- (1 to 2)
  1                cup  malted wheat flakes
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
                        -- (they recommend their white whole
                        wheat)
  1         tablespoon  instant yeast
  2        tablespoons  melted butter or oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (3 to 4)
                        -- or bread flour


Pour the 2 cups of water into a mixing bowl. Stir in the barley malt, wheat flakes and wheat flour. Mix in the yeast and allow this sponge to work for 15 to 20 minutes.

Stir in the butter or oil, salt and about 2-1/2 cups of the unbleached flour. Add flour slowly until you have a shaggy mass that begins to hold together and pull away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn the dough out onto a floured kneading surface and knead until it's cohesive. Give it a rest while you clean out and lightly oil the bowl. Continue kneading for several minutes, adding only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to you or the board.

Return the dough to the bowl, turning it so the top of the dough has a thin film of oil on it. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap...and let the dough rise until it has doubled in bulk... Punch the dough down, cut it in half and shape it to fit two 8-1/2 by 4-1/2-inch bread pans. Allow to rise until the dough is about 3/4 risen, full but so a fingerprint still bounces back.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or till it tests done. Remove and cool on a rack.
I agree, it's good stuff.

NOTES : I use this recipe for granary bread from King Arthur Flour. It calls for malted wheat flakes, which are available through their catalog, and barley malt syrup, which is available in health food departments of grocery stores and also through KA. Elizabeth David discusses Granary bread in her classic book, English Bread & Yeast Cookery. She says that the loaf has some rye meal in it, too, although this recipe doesn't call for it.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water
  5 1/2           cups  bread flour
  2                tsp  salt
  1 1/4           cups  cool water
     1/2           cup  biga
  1               tbsp  unsalted butter
  1               tbsp  extra virgin olive oil
                        ---
  1                cup  poppy seeds

Dissolve yeast in small bowl - 15 minutes. Place flour in large bowl, stir in salt and add yeast, cool water and biga. Mix.

Knead while turning bowl. Fold from side of bowl to center vigorously. Slap dough back into bowl. and knead until dough comes away from sides cleanly. Knead on surface about 20 minutes on and off. Return to bowl. Form well in center and break butter into small pieces adding it to well along with olive oil. Gently knead until thoroughly incorporated. Dough will come apart, but will come together again. Shape into ball. Place in oiled covered bowl and let rise. about 1 hour.

Turn onto well floured surface. With fingertips press out most of air while forming into 9" x 6" rectangle. Fold about 1/2" of farthest edge toward you like wrapping silverware in napkin. Introduce some tension so that roll is tight and try not to extend length. It will be a fat roll - about 6" in diameter - when done. When you reach edge nearest you, seal edge with heel of hand.

Rub olive oil on section of work area about 1 1/2 times the size of the roll. Place roll here, cover and let rise about one hour. Preheat oven 425.

Have 2 baking sheets ready. Uncover dough roll and brush it all over with oil.
Measure one cup poppy seeds and drop generous handfull alog length of roll and then spread them all along with finger. As you cut dough, pull remaining pieces through seeds.

Using sharp serated knife, cut dough crosswise into 1/4" wide pieces, pulling each piece gently away from roll as you cut it. Cut several pieces at a time and then form them into bread sticks. With one hand, grasp top and other the bottom of each piece. Pick it up and gently move hands outward and parallel. The dough will begin to stretch easily once it is lifted from surface. Stretch to about 12" in length and place cross\wise on baking sheet. Mist generously, and place in oven. Bake 5 minutes and then mist again. Bake about 20-25 minutes.

NOTES : Tried this the first time for Thanksgiving and they were excellent. They were even better two days later when they were overheated in the oven and developed a great hard crust and a nice chewy interior.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               Cups  hard whole wheat flour -- or more as
                        necessary
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           Cups  warm water
                        Optional toppings:
                        Grated Parmesan
                        Cayenne
                        Coarse salt
                        Sesame seeds
                        Cumin seed

You will need a food processor, several 10- by 14-inch baking sheets or pizza pans, a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, and a clean spray bottle. Place the flour and salt in a food processor and process for 10 seconds to mix thoroughly. With the motor running, add the water in a steady stream, then process for 10 seconds longer. The dough should have formed into one large ball; if not, feel the dough: If it feels very sticky, add 3 to 4 tablespoons more flour and process briefly until a ball forms. If the dough feels dry and floury, start the processor again, add 2 to 3 tabespoons more water, and process until a ball of dough forms. Once you have a ball of dough, process for 1 minute more, no longer. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 30 seconds or so. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, and place two racks near the center of the oven.
Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the other pieces covered. On a lightly floured surface, with lightly floured hands, flatten a piece of dough with your palms. Then roll it out to a very thin rectangle or round, as even a thinness as possible to ensure even cooking. Gently lift the dough from your rollling surface and place it on a large baking sheet or pizza pan. Sprinkle on one of the optional toppings or leave plain. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut through the dough to make rectangular crackers. (Dont worry if they are not all exactly the same size. Variations in size and flavor will make your crackers interesting.) Spray the dough lightly with water and place on the upper oven rack. Begin rolling out the next piece of dough, keeping an eye on the crackers already baking. (Crackers brown from underneath.) Check on them 2 1/2 to 3 minutes after they go in. As soon as the thinnest patches of the dough have started to brown, take them out. If necessary, continue baking, checking every 30 seconds, but it is better to take the crackers out a little early than too late.
You will soon get a feel for timing and degree of doneness. Variables that affect timing are the heat of your oven and how thin you managed to roll out your dough. When they come out of the oven, some of the crackers will be crisp, while others will need a little time in the air to crisp up. Transfer to a large bowl, breaking up any incompletely separated crackers. Roll out the remaining dough, season, and bake. When completely cool, crackers can be stored in a well-sealed plastic bag or cookie tins for up to a month.

Yield: Approximately 13 dozen very thin crackers of varying size, averaging 1 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches

NOTES : Re crackers: you can roll them directly on the baking pan - I use a half pan (heavy duty rimmed jellyroll pan) turned up side down. Spray the bottom with Pam ,then roll the dough out directly on it - you can get it paper thein this way and not have to worry aobut transferring it later. Lora Brody [Blanche007@aol.com]

Sourdough may be the oldest of all leavened bread forms. It dates back to at least 4,000 B.C., when favorable microorganisms drifted accidentally into wheat bread made by Egyptians. The dough, probably set aside awhile before baking, didn't rise very much, but it was enough to give it a lighter texture and a better taste. Word of this new bread spread, and curiosity was raised. Soon, adding ferments to bread dough was a common practice. Beer, grape juice, wine, and wheat flour porridge left to "go sour" were leavening regulars in the ancient world. Still, the demanding process of leavening bread made such bread a scarce food well into the Middle Ages.

The original leavening process took many forms. The most common was to leave a piece of dough from each day's baking and incorporate it into the next day's mix. This method created the early ancestor of the sourdough starters we know and love today. Legend has it that sourdough starters made their way to America in the hold of Columbus' ship. By the mid-19th century, starters were vital to both prospectors and pioneers.

Prospectors carried the starter in their backpacks to make a batch of bread whenever the spirit and hunger moved them. This saved an arduous, if not impossible, trek to the nearest town for a bit of yeast. By 1849 sourdough had gathered fame throughout the country.

"Sourdough" even become the nickname for the California Klondike miners at the turn of the century. So important was their leavener that during the harsh winter prospectors slept with their starters to keep them from freezing. The son of an Alaskan "sourdough" wrote that every miner's cabin featured, hanging over its red-hot stove, a "tin full of fermented dough, used in place of yeast in making bread, biscuits and flapjacks". A bubbling jar or aromatic starter was also the secret weapon of many pioneer wives and bachelors in the 19th century. The jar held the key to delicious breads and biscuits when milk was as scarce as yeast. The "sponge", as it was called, was carried carefully in covered wagons and fed faithfully to keep it alive.

Much like a generous friend, the starter fed many families well. Starters were passed from friend to friend and from generation to generation. As bread made from sourdough developed its own unique flavor, it gathered a legion of defenders who created a sourdough mystique. The legion continued to grow even after yeast become readily available. For some, bread made from packaged yeast cannot duplicate the tart flavor and aroma of a sourdough bread, and these bakers remain true to that old friend who waits faithfully for them in a little jar in their refrigerator.

Whole Wheat Hot Roll Mix Variation:
Use 9 cups of whole-wheat flour and 8 cups of unbleached flour; decrease sugar to 1 cup. Substitute packed brown sugar for granulated, if desired.

Use within a week if stored in a cool dry place, as whole grain flours can turn rancid quickly. Will keep for 10 -12 weeks under refrigeration or up to 6 months in the freezer.

Makes about 18 cups Whole Wheat Hot Roll Mix.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  honey
  1            package  active dry yeast
                        -- (2 1/2 teaspoons)
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- (1/4 cup) melted
  2              large  egg yolks
  4               cups  bread flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        ---
                        Glaze
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- (1/4 cup)
     2/3           cup  confectioners' sugar
                        ---
  12                    dried currants -- halved

In a small saucepan, heat milk with honey, stirring, over low heat just until lukewarm and remove pan from heat. Stir in yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add butter and yolks, whisking until combined well.

Transfer milk mixture to bowl of a standing electric mixer (or to a large bowl, if kneading by hand). Add flour and salt gradually to milk mixture, stirring until incorporated. With dough hook, knead dough until smooth, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, dough may be kneaded by hand on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 10 to 15 minutes.)

Transfer dough to a lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat with oil. Let dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in refrigerator overnight, or until doubled in bulk. (Alternatively, dough may be allowed to rise in a warm place about 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.)

Grease 2 baking sheets. Punch down dough and divide into 12 pieces. Form each piece into an egg shape and transfer pieces to prepared baking sheets. Form a bunny tail on each piece by holding scissors, points down, perpendicular to baking sheet and making a 1/2-inch-long snip at base of wide end. Form 2 bunny ears on each piece by making a narrow 2-inch-long snip on each side, starting near wide end and cutting toward narrow end. Form eyes on each piece by making 2 holes in narrow end with a wooden pick and pressing a currant half firmly into each hole with pick.

Brush half of warm glaze on rolls and let rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place 45 minutes or less, or until doubled, in bulk (rising will take longer if dough is cold).

Preheat oven to 400F.

Heat remaining glaze over low heat just until warm and brush rolls. Bake rolls in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets in oven halfway through baking, 20 minutes, or until golden, and transfer to racks to cool.

Serve rolls warm or at room temperature.



In a small saucepan, heat glaze ingredients over low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Remove pan from heat and keep glaze warm, covered.

Makes 12 Rolls.

Mix the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. In a smaller bowl, beat the liquid ingredients together. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry, and mix together until blended. Pour into a greased 8-inch square or round cake pan.

Preheat your oven to 350F and bake for about 30 minutes. Eat with whatever you feel like: frosting, whipped cream, ice cream, coffee, or all by itself!

                 King Arthur Flour's Original Pound Cake

  2               cups  butter -- (4 sticks)
  2               cups  granulated sugar -- (2 to 2 1/4)
  8                     extra large or 9 large eggs
  4               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  brandy or sherry
  2          teaspoons  vanilla -- almond or other
                        flavoring

A traditional pound cake has no leavening other than air and eggs. Our recipe, while egg rich, has some baking powder in it as well to lighten it a little.

To lighten it even more, separate the eggs before you begin. After creaming the butter and adding the sugar, beat in just the egg yolks. Beat the whites separately until they form stiff peaks, and fold them in after all the other ingredients have been combined.

Preheat your oven to 350F.

In a large bowl, cream the butter until very light. Add the sugar gradually and then the eggs, one by one, and continue beating until the mixture is very light and fluffy. (An electric mixer can be most helpful and effective here.)

When you cream butter, it may seem at the beginning as if you're just mashing it flat. But if you persevere, you'll begin to see it get "fluffy." What you're really doing is adding air. When you beat the butter with sugar, it becomes even fluffier, evidence of more air. And when the eggs are beaten in, the fluffiness is at its peak. That's why this part of the mixing is so important. The more air bubbles you can beat in at this stage, the more air bubbles there are to expand in the heat of the oven. Baking powder or soda can do part of the work of leavening, but the more air bubbles you can get into a batter manually, the finer and lighter the texture of the finished cake.

In a separate bowl, blend together the flour, baking powder and salt.

Pour the milk into a third small bowl, mix the brandy and vanilla, or whatever flavoring you're partial to.

Alternately add the wet and dry ingredients to the butter/sugar/egg mixture. Pour into a lightly greased tube pan, or two 5 X 9 inch bread pans, and bake for about 1 hour or until the top surface of the cake springs back when you press on it gently with your fingers.

Let the cake cool thoroughly after it is done, cover and store for a couple of days to allow the flavor to mature. A pound cake is usually sliced thin.

NOTES : At the heavy end of the butter cake spectrum is the pound cake, the original or "grandmother" of all butter cakes. This cake is incredibly rich, but fortunately, a very thin slice goes a long, long way.

The water will work if the measurements are exact,e.g. 1 c flour = 4 oz,  other wise you usually have to add more water.

NOTES : This is a recipe I developed while trying to mimic a bread I ate at an excellent French restaurant in my area (central NJ). For want of a better name I call it KSB (kitchen sink bread, since everything but goes in it). It has a rye flavor sweetened by the raisons and a soft crumb contrasted by the crunchy seeds. It can be made in a bread machine or by hand. I love this bread which tastes so good, you don't have to put anything on it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Crust
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/8           cup  butter -- (6 tablespoons)
                        chilled and cut into small pieces
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- (3 to 3 1/2)
                        Filling
     1/2           cup  yogurt cheese* -- made from 1 cup
                        low-fat vanilla yogurt, or 1 1/3 small
  1           packages  (4 ounces) cream cheese, at room
                        temperature
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Topping
  1 1/2           cups  strawberries -- (about 1/2 pint)
                        hulled and sliced lengthwise
  3             medium  kiwis -- peeled and sliced
                        length wise
  3        tablespoons  apple jelly
  1           teaspoon  water

Crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing the mixture with a fork or your fingers until it holds together. Form the dough into a ball, flatten it into a disk, wrap it in plastic and chill for several hours or overnight.

Let the dough rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Roll it out to 1/4-inch thickness and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Roll and crimp the top edges of the crust decoratively between your forefinger and thumb, and prick the bottom of the crust all over with a fork. Chill for 30 minutes.

When the crust has chilled, bake it in a preheated 350F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until it's golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Filling: In a medium bowl, mix the yogurt cheese or softened cream cheese gradually into the sugar and vanilla, beating all the while until the mixture is very smooth. Whip the cream to stiff peaks and fold it gently into the cheese mixture, just until it's fully incorporated. Spoon the filling into the cooled, baked crust and smooth with a spatula.

Topping: Arrange the fruit in concentric circles over the top of the tart. (Starting from the outside of the crust, we laid the kiwi slices down in two circles, then filled the center with some of the strawberry slices and finally tucked the rest of them, pointed side up, into any remaining space. Any arrangement you think looks nice will work well.)

Melt the jelly and water in a small saucepan over low heat, cool slightly, then brush it over the entire surface of the tart. Chill for several hours before serving. We actually refrigerated it overnight, and the next day the crust was amazingly crisp! Yield: 14 servings

NOTES : Somewhere in the territory between tart and pie, yet ultimately more akin to a tart, here's an attractive and refreshing dessert to serve beside steaming black coffee.

  1                cup  warm water
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3 3/4           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3                     cardamom seeds -- crushed, or 1
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
                        Glaze
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Put all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine and program for Dough or Manual. Check the dough after a few minutes of kneading, adding flour or water to achieve a smooth, soft consistency.

When the dough cycle is complete, remove the dough from the pan and roll it into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Cut it lengthwise into three equal strips. Braid the strips into a loaf, tucking the ends under. Let the loaf rise, covered, on a parchment-lined baking sheet for about 1 hour, or until it's doubled in size. Bake the bread in a preheated 375F oven for about 30 minutes, or until it's golden brown. Remove it from the oven and brush it with the glaze, which you've made by whisking together the egg, milk and sugar. Place the bread back in the oven for 1 minute, then remove it and cool it on a rack.

Note: For a sweeter bread, sprinkle the loaf with coarse sugar after you've glazed it. Yield: 1 loaf

NOTES : Nisu is the name of a Finnish yeasted coffee cake. This recipe hails from Lanesville, a small community now part of Gloucester, Massachusetts. The community was settled by my grandmother, Isabel Lane, and her family; early inhabitants also included many Finns

This bread is very tender and has a sugary glaze, but the Finns of Lanesville would put sugar cubes in their mouths, take a bite of the bread and swallow a bit of coffee. Use your bread machine to make the dough, then shape and bake the loaf yourself.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bars
     3/4           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar -- firmly packed
  1                     egg
  2          teaspoons  lemon peel and orange peel -- or 1/4 teaspoon
                        lemon oil and orange oil
  2 1/4           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

                        ginger

  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
  6        tablespoons  brandy or apple juice (or a combination)

*A small food processor is the tool we prefer for this task.

In a medium saucepan, bring the honey and brown sugar to a boil while stirring occasionally. Remove the mixture from the heat and cool it until it's just warm.

In a large bowl, beat together the cooled honey mixture, the egg, and the lemon and orange peel or oil. Add the flour, baking soda, almonds, spices and ground crystallized ginger and beat until very well-combined. The dough will be on the stiff side, but also very sticky. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it overnight.

The next day, preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 9 x 13-inch pan.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 9 x 13-inch rectangle. Carefully transfer the dough rectangle to the prepared pan, either by wrapping it around the rolling pin and then unfolding it into the pan, or using a giant spatula. Try to fit the dough into the pan without pressing down too hard around its edges; otherwise these areas will be dense and tough.

Bake the bars for 20 to 22 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Prepare the glaze while the bars are baking by stirring the brandy or apple juice into the confectioners' sugar and mixing until smooth. Transfer the baked bars to a cooling rack and immediately brush on the glaze with a pastry brush; let the glaze soak into the bars somewhat before applying another layer.

Let cool completely before cutting into 1 x 2-inch bars. Store the bars in an airtight container with a slice of apple (for its softening powers). If you make the lebkuchen 2 to 3 days ahead of time, they'll taste even better. Yield: 54 bars

NOTES : These spicy gingerbread-like bars, which are traditional holiday fare in Germany, contain no fat save that in the egg. Still they're almost as addictive, with their hard sugar glaze and their nippy bite of crystallized ginger (substituted for the more typical citron, unless you really happen to like that particular ingredient). They keep very well too, especially when a piece of apple is tucked into their airtight container to soften them. They're a perfect accompaniment to hot tea after a blustery afternoon of scouring the shops for just-right presents.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar till thoroughly combined. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix the buttermilk or yogurt and lemon oil, and set aside. Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt, and set aside.

Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with the buttermilk mixture. Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for about 50 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove the bread from the oven, and poke it all over with a cake tester, ice pick, or other long, thin tool. Whisk together the glaze ingredients, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and while the cake is hot drizzle it gradually with the glaze, stopping periodically to allow it to soak in. Set the bread aside, and let it cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove it from the pan, and allow it to cool completely before slicing. Yield: 1 loaf

NOTES : This bread is a treat for anyone who loves the fresh, bright taste of citrus. Made doubly moist by the lemon-sugar glaze applied after it comes out of the oven, it's reminiscent of poke cake (remember that?). It's sweet enough to serve for dessert, yet tart enough to go well in a brunch breadbasket with other muffins and breads.

                        Dough
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
     3/4           cup  lukewarm milk
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- (1 stick) melted
  1                     egg
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon oil or 1 tablespoon grated lemon
                        zest
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4 1/3           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast

     1/8      teaspoon  lemon oil or 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon
                        zest

Manual/Mixer Method: Combine all of the dough ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir to form a cohesive dough. Knead the dough, by hand (on a lightly oiled work surface) or machine, for 5 to 8 minutes, until it's smooth, soft and supple; avoid adding too much flour, as this will make the buns tough and dry. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until it's puffy, though it may not have doubled in bulk.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. When the machine has completed its cycle, set a timer for 30 minutes, and allow the dough to continue to rise; it may crest the top of the bucket, but shouldn't overflow. Keep your eye on it.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and divide it into 20 pieces. Allow the pieces to rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Round the dough into balls, and place them in two lightly greased 9-inch round cake pans. Cover the pans, and allow the buns to rise for about 1 hour, or until they're nice and puffy and have filled the pan. While the buns are rising, combine the glaze ingredients, and set aside.

Brush the buns lightly with half of the glaze. Bake them in a preheated 375F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove the buns from the oven, and brush them with the remaining glaze. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool. Serve with jam and whipped cream cheese, or with jam alone; they're also delicious at dinner with fish, or a pasta salad. Yield: 20 buns

NOTES : These buns are the quintessential hot yeast bun -- but with an unexpected and refreshing jolt of lemon. The lemon elevates them beyond ordinary dinner rolls to something special: tea or breakfast rolls, perfect for spreading with homemade preserves. Tender and buttery, with a crisp, golden crust, they're distinctly and assertively lemon, but not sweet: a new and interesting concept in baked goods. These are just simply awesome with raspberry jam!

Meanwhile mix reserved lemon juice and maple syrup in a cup. While bread is still warm, pierce top all over with toothpick, then gently brush with syrup letting syrup soak in before adding more.

Place on a serving plate; let cool. Slice with a serrated knife.

          Lemon Ricotta Puff Pancakes With Vanilla Scented Sauce

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Food Processor
                Miscellaneous & Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Batter
  3                     eggs -- separated
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  lemon zest (the zest from 2 large lemons)
                        OR 1 teaspoon lemon oil*
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Sauce
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar OR 3 tablespoons
                        Baker's Special Sugar*
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Batter: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat togehter the egg yolks, buttermilk, sugar and ricotta cheese. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, lemon zest, nutmeg and salt. In a third bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.

Mix the dry ingredients into the buttermilk mixture with a few quick strokes. A few lumps remaining are OK. Fold in the egg whites. Heat a lightly greased griddle or sillet over medium heat until hot enough to evaporate immediately a drop of water, and drop the batter, by quarter-cupfuls, onto the heated griddle. Cook for about 2 1/2 minutes on the first side; bubbles should rise and burst on the first side before you flip the pancakes over. Cook for about 1 minute on the second side. They should be a very light golden brown when finished.

If you wish the pancakes may be made a day ahead, cooled on a wire rack, then wrapped tightly and refrigerated. To reheat, preheat your oven to 375F, place the pancakes on a lightly greased baking sheet, and heat for 5 minutes.

Sauce: Mix all of the ingredients until smooth in a small mixing bowl. For an ultra-smooth sauce, blend in a blender or food processor. Refrigerate until needed. Thin with 1 tablespoon milk or cream if sauce is too thick.

Yield: 14 to 18 4-inch pancakes, about 5 servings.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.

     1/2          cups  Raisins
     2/3          cups  Rolled Oats -- Note 1

Note 1: toasted in 350F oven for 10 min. or until light brown

Add the first 8 ingredients to bread machine according to manufacturer's instructions. Set it for the dough setting (mine calls it the manual cycle). When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine. Cover and let rise 10 min. In a small saucepan, stir together the syrup, spices and brown sugar. Cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and stir in raisins and toasted rolled oats. Set aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12x8 rectangle. Spread raisin mixture over dough to all edges. Roll up jelly roll style, pinch seams to seal. Cut into 1 inch slices. Place rolls, cut sides down, on non stick cookie sheet. I gave my sheet a couple of spritzs with cooking spray and I think it helped. When the rolls come out, you need to use a spatula to pry them off the pan, because the brown sugar will have stuck, but they come right up. These had just the right amount of sweetness. Enjoy!

Put in a clean oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until double. Punch down and let raise again. Turn out on work surface .. knead .. let rest. Divide into 4. Put into two 4 x 8 bread pans. ( I do that so we have 4 smaller loaves for freezing.) Let rise until almost double. Bake at 375F for 35 - 40 minutes. Remove from pans I put it into the oven again for 5 minutes directly on baking tiles and let cool on rack. If you want a soft crust rub on butter and cover with towel.

This is our standard breakfast toast bread. I also make regularly the carraway rye from "Cooks Illustrated" ... very very good. Our third standard bread is the pain levain from Bread Alone though I have trouble with the chef and levain and coming out with the right amount ... but the bread turns out well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled and chopped
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1          small can  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin or chili powder -- (2 to 3)
  1                     jalapeno pepper -- seeds removed,
                        minced (1 to 2 tablespoons)
     3/4           cup  fresh corn (about what comes off one
  1          large ear  corn)
  1                can  black or kidney beans -- drained
     1/2         bunch  fresh cilantro
                        Sour Cream-Cilantro Sauce
     1/2         bunch  fresh cilantro
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/8      teaspoon  lime oil OR 2 teaspoons lime juice
  1         tablespoon  dried minced onion
                        Topping
                        iceberg or romaine lettuce -- shredded
  1                     tomato -- diced

Filling: In a medium-sized skillet set over medium heat, brown the ground beef, chopping it with a spatula into fine bits. Drain the fat and add the salt, garlic, onion, tomato paste, water, ground cumin or chili, and jalapeno pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, then add the corn and drained beans, and cook until heated through. Mix in half of the bunch of cilantro, which you've minced.

Sauce:Mince the remaining cilantro finely, and combine it with the sour cream, lime oil or juice, and dried onion. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer, to meld flavors.

Assembly: Spoon about 1/2 cup of the filling down the center of one of the breads. Top with 1 tablespoon of the sauce, then garnish with shredded lettuce and diced tomato. Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Crust
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick)
  1 1/3           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2        tablespoons  plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  confectioners' sugar
                        Filling
  1              quart  strawberries (cut the large ones into
                        smaller pieces)
     1/4           cup  quick-cooking tapioca
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  orange extract (optional)

Melt butter in a 9-inch microwave-proof pie plate. Add flour and sugars to pie plate; mix with fork and, using your fingers, mold resulting dough around sides and bottom of plate. Prick with a fork, cover with waxed paper and microwave for 7 to 8 minutes, or until crust smells shortbread-y.

Mix the strawberries, tapioca, sugar and orange extract in a bowl. Stir well, and let sit 15 minutes.

Spoon the filling into the baked pie crust. Dot generously with butter, re-cover with waxed paper, and microwave for 8 minutes, or until fruit bubbles. Leave pie in turned-off microwave a couple of minutes, then remove. Using a fork, smooth out the surface of the pie, pushing down any strawberries that aren't covered with liquid. Let pie cool somewhat before serving.

Just A Hint...
Not that strawberries are all that hard to chop... But if you find the job tedious, or need berries chopped quite finely, spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet and set the sheet in the freezer. When berries are frozen through, chop them in a food processor, as coarsely or as finely as needed.

NOTES : This is not Pie As We Know It. Rather, it's a combination of fresh berries, butter and sugar, with just enough thickener, in the form of flour and tapioca, to kind of hold the whole thing together. It's a novelty food, really; I mean, microwave pie? "Impress your friends and co-workers by whipping up this pie right in the office! It's fast! It's easy! And only 20 minutes from start to finish!" Remember that blueberries, blackberries and peaches work just as well as strawberries in this recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  warm milk -- 105 to 110F
  1                cup  warm water -- 105 to 110F
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted and slightly
                        cooled
  2               cups  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour
  4               cups  Special For Machines Bread Flour -- (4 to 5)
     1/8      teaspoon  ascorbic acid (with so much molasses
                        -- this will really
                        -- help your dough rise)
  1         tablespoon  instant yeast (first choice)
                        -- or active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sunflower seeds
  3        tablespoons  poppy seeds
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  3        tablespoons  flax seeds
     1/2           cup  molasses

Blend together the milk, water, melted butter, white wheat flour and 2 cups of the bread flour in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the ascorbic acid, yeast and salt, and beat the mixture for 2 minutes. (If you're using active dry yeast, reserve 1/4 cup of water in which to proof the yeast before adding it.)

Beat in the seeds and molasses. Add the remaining bread flour gradually, beating all the while, until the dough has formed a smooth ball. Knead for 3 to 5 minutes on medium speed.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly; it should be smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning it so the top of the dough is coated with a thin film of oil. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Punch down the dough, divide it in half and shape each piece into a loaf. Place the loaves in two lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pans, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until the dough has crowned 1 inch over the top of the pans, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Bake the bread in a preheated 375F oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the loaves registers 190F. Turn the loaves out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Yield: 2 loaves, each yielding seventeen 1/2-inch slices

NOTES : Yum! This is a combination of ingredients in bread that I've been wanting to try for some time, and after much trial and error, here's a reliable recipe for a moist, high-rising loaf that keeps well, slices easily and, of course, contains a hefty dose of molasses, as well as much interesting crunch from four kinds of seeds. A great bread with which to expand your toast repertoire (try it in French toast sometime, too, for a more unusual rendition), it's also delicious plain and untoasted. Its rising time is a bit longer than usual for sandwich bread, but don't rush it; the wait is worth the end result, and that's just plain good.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable shortening or butter
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  3                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3 3/8           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1            package  sweetened flaked coconut -- (7 ounces)
                        approximately 25 candied red cherries -- cut in
                        half.

Preheat the oven to 375F. In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening or butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla until light and fluffy.

Sift the salt, flour and baking soda together into a small bowl and gradually blend them into the egg mixture. Mix in the coconut until it's well-combined.

Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheets; press each drop down slightly to form a roughly round shape. Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, or until they're light golden brown and just firm to the touch. As soon as the hugs come out of the oven, plunk half of a candied cherry (round-side up, of course!) into the center of each cookie and press down gently. Cool the cookies completely on a wire rack.

NOTES : "Dorothy Stewart, from Kansas, made these cookies when she took her four daughters on picnics. They got their name because she hugged them to her chest -- and thus changed their shape -- when her girls made her nervous." So proclaims the chuckle-worthy inscription on a recipe card handed over by Lucinda Kolo-Caron, Stewart's granddaughter and wife of King Arthur Flour's Public Relations Director Joe Caron. With that bit of explanation covered, we can now tell you that they're a really yummy sort of snicker doodle/coconut macaroon hybrid that prompted immediate requests for the recipe from many who tasted them here. They'd add a nice celebratory note to any platter of holiday cookies.

     1/2           cup  sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  poppy seeds
     1/4           cup  flax seeds
  2        tablespoons  caraway seeds
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  2               cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  5               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        --
                        (approximately)
                        vegetable oil

Place the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, flax seeds and caraway seeds in a skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the sesame seeds have turned golden brown. This takes about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.

In a large bowl, stir the yeast into the water to soften. Add honey, salt, shortening, cooled seeds, and 2 cups flour to the yeast mixture. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, a little at a time, until you have a dough stiff enough to knead. Turn dough out onto a floured surface.

Knead, adding flour as necessary, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Leave dough on work surface. Cover with a towel and let rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball. Cover the balls with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes.

Flatten each ball into a 3 1/2-inch circle. Make them slightly concave in the center. Place 1/2-inch apart on a well-greased baking sheet. Brush the tops lightly with vegetable oil, and lay a piece of plastic wrap over the buns. Cover the wrap with a cloth towel. Refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

Twenty minutes before baking, remove the buns from the refrigerator and let sit, covered, at room temperature.

Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 20 minutes, or until done. Immediately remove buns from baking sheet and cool on a rack. Makes 12 buns

NOTES : These buns are mixed, shaped and allowed to rise in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. The cool rise adds extra flavor; it also gives flexibility in timing. You can start them one day and bake them in the cool of the next morning, or start them before you leave for work and finish them just before your evening meal.

  2          Teaspoons  Active Dry Yeast -- Or
                        Quick-Rise Yeast

Combine the water, wheat and millet in the bread pan. Let stand for 30 minutes until the mixture has cooled to lukewarm. Add the remaining ingredients in order, ending with the dry yeast on top. Fr machines that reverse the order, combine the water, wheat and millet in a bowl and let cool for 30 minutes. Measure remaining ingredients in reverse order into the bread pan and pour the wheat mixture over the top.

Program the machine to wheat bread, or basic bread. Press start.

In about 1-1/2 hours, your bread machine will produce this dough all ready for shaping, rising and baking.
The original recipe produced three loaves. I have successfully made this dough in the small as well as the larger bread machine baking pans. To produce a baked loaf, use a machine with a pan capacity of at least 12 cups and reduce the amount of yeast to 1-1/2 teaspoonful.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough
  2 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose OR 2
     3/4          cups  Round Table Unbleached Pastry
                        Flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  3        tablespoons  chives (fresh if available -- or freeze-dried)
     1/2           cup  butter -- (1 stick)
     3/4           cup  milk (plus 1 or 2 additional tablespoons
                        if the dough seems dry)
                        Filling
  1                cup  shredded Swiss or Jarlsberg cheese
  2 1/2         ounces  sliced ham -- (3 or 4 slices) (2
     1/2                ) -- (1/2 to 4)
                        prepared mustard (optional)

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, mustard and chives. Cut in the cold butter by whatever method you prefer (pastry blender, two knives, rubbing between you fingers, food processor or mixer). When the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal with a few larger pieces of butter remaining, add the liquid. Stir together and turn out onto a lightly greased surface. If the dough is very crumbly add 1 tablespoon of milk to bring it together. Knead the dough jut enough - three or four turns -- for it to hold together.

Divide the dough in half, and pat each piece into an 8-inch circle. Place one circle of dough on a lightly greased baking sheet. Spread one layer with prepared mustard, if desired, then layer half the cheese, the ham, then the remaining cheese on top of the dough, leaving 1/2 inch of dough uncovered around the edge. Brush the edge with water, then place the second round of dough on top. Press firmly around the edges to seal. Refrigerate until about 45 minutes before you want to serve the biscuit.

Bake the biscuit in a preheated 375F oven for 30 to 35 minutes. If you've made small individual biscuits, bake at 400F for 10 to 12 minutes. Yield: 1 large biscuits, or 10 to 12 2-inch appetizer-sized biscuits.

This is one of our favorite brunch dishes, possessing as it does the attribute of being able to be put together the night before, then baked off just before guests arrive. All you need to add is a salad of mixed greens and some fresh fruit for a simple do-ahead brunch.

For easiest cutting, let the biscuit cool for 10 minutes, then use a serrated knife to gently "saw" through the layers. We sometimes like to add thinly sliced raw onions to the ham and cheese for a little extra "kick". And experiment with different types of mustard, too; plain yellow, Dijon, hot and sweet, horseradish and grainy French will all give different results. This recipe makes one large, round biscuit that can be cut into 6 to 8 slices, enough for four to six people, depending on their appetites.

                            Mystery Mocha Cake

Recipe By     :www.kingarthurflour.com
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cake
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose or
                        White Whole Wheat Flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  low-fat cocoa
     3/4           cup  skim milk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
                        Sauce
     1/2           cup  brown sugar -- packed
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  low-fat cocoa
  1                cup  double-strength coffee -- room temperature

Cake: In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa. Add the milk and vanilla; beat till smooth. Pour the batter into a lightly greased 8" x 8" pan.

Sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the white and brown sugars. Sprinkle evenly over the cake batter in the pan. Pour the coffee over all. This may look kind of strange and messy, but never fear; everything will turn out fine.

Bake the cake in a preheated 350F oven for 40 minutes, or until the top springs back when pressed gently. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. This cake is best enjoyed warm, between half an hour and an hour after you've taken it out of the oven. However, it's also very good cold; I left a piece out on the counter for three days to see how it would age, and it was fine -- still moist, and not at all rubbery. Yield: 1 cake, sixteen 2 x 2-inch servings

NOTES : The only mysterious thing about this cake is how it can be so delicious and still contain virtually no fat. Looking at this deep, almost black chocolate cake, cushioned in a velvety fudge sauce, you'll think, "No way. No way is this cake low-calorie." But, at 124 calories a serving (not including the whipped cream/ice cream you'll be dying to add), it won't push your calorie count for the day into the stratosphere.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2              large  ripe nectarines
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  1 1/3           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1 3/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla or almond extract
  1                     egg

Melt 4 tablespoons butter, and mix with brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. Spoon into an ungreased 8x8-inch square baking pan.

Slice nectarines 1/4-inch thick. Lay slices into prepared pan, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream butter or margarine and sugar, then beat in milk, egg, and vanilla or almond extract. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt. Pour batter over fruit in pan.

Bake cake in a preheated 375F oven for 45 minutes, or until cake begins to pull away from sides of pan, and springs back to the touch. Remove from oven, and cool for 5 minutes in the pan. Invert pan onto a serving platter, and let sit 1 minute more before removing pan. If any fruit sticks to pan, use a spatula to carefully scrape it off and replace it on the cake. Serve warm, with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.

NOTES : Pineapple upside-down cake is a long-time favorite in this genre, but other fruits serve equally well in place of pineapple. Try cherries and almonds, apples, or pears. Here unpeeled nectarines lend a real summery taste to this year-round treat.

                    New Hampshire Maple Walnut Scones

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1                cup  finely chopped walnuts* -- (3 1/2 ounces,
                        about 3/4 cup walnut halves)
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening (or unsalted butter -- or a
                        combination)
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  maple syrup -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  maple flavoring

*The walnuts are tastier if you toast them before chopping. Place walnut pieces in a single layer in a flat pan and toast them in a preheated 350F oven for 7 to 9 minutes, or until they smell "toasty" and are beginning to brown.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, walnuts, baking powder and salt. Cut in the shortening and/or butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

In a separate bowl, combine the milk, 1/3 cup (3 3/4 ounces) of the maple syrup, and the maple flavoring. (You can leave out the maple flavoring if you wish, but it really adds a nice touch.) Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until you've formed a very soft dough.

Flour your work surface generously, and scrape the dough out of the mixing bowl onto the floured surface. Divide the dough in half.

Working with one half at a time, gently pat the dough into a 7-inch circle about 7/8-inch thick. Transfer the circle to a parchment-lined or lightly greased cookie sheet or other flat pan; it'll be very soft, and if you have a giant spatula, it's the tool of choice here. Repeat with the remaining half of the dough, placing it on a separate pan.

Using a sharp bench knife or rolling pizza wheel, divide each dough circle into eight wedges. Gently separate the wedges so that they're almost touching in the center, but are spaced about an inch apart at the edges. Pierce the tops of the scones with the tines of a fork, and brush them with some of the remaining maple syrup.

Bake the scones in a preheated 425F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and brush them with any remaining maple syrup. Wait a couple of minutes, then gently separate the scones with a knife (they'll be very fragile), and carefully transfer them to a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature, with jam or maple butter (or even better, maple cream, an amber-colored, spreadable version of maple syrup, available at just about any New England shop selling native maple syrup).

NOTES : And you thought Vermont was the only state in New England famous for its maple syrup! Well, just because some surveyors way back when decided to make the Connecticut River the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, it doesn't mean maple trees grow differently (or produce different sap) on one side of the river or the other. New Hampshire maple syrup is every bit as tasty -- and its creation every bit as magical -- as Vermont maple syrup, though it's never enjoyed the same fame (or acclaim). If you're ever visiting northern New England in the early spring -- late February through March -- try to stop at a sugar house. The hot, rich maple steam billowing from the flat sugar pans, as the maple sap slowly boils down to golden syrup, is a smell you'll never forget. To northern New Englanders (Maine included, even though it's the Pine Tree State), it's the very first smell of spring.

Add 1 teaspoon vinigar or lemon juice to 1 cup of soy milk to sub for 1 cup of buttermilk.

The important aspect of buttermilk is the acidity (especially important in quick breads that utilize baking soda). ["Donner,Pamela" <pamela.l.donner@abbott.com>]

I usually use apple-cider vinegar because I enjoy the added flavor.

1/2 cup buttermilk = 1/2 cup soy milk plus 1 1/2 tsp vinegar [Stephanie E Toth <toth+@andrew.cmu.edu>]

NOTES : Use this recipe in onion white bread, pumpernickel, rye, onion rolls, sticks,  Foccacia, pizza, and wherever your imagination leads you, says the author.

I make a "Sour Rye Bread" from the book that has for a variation "Onion Rye"  using the above filling. It says to knead into the dough immediately after  mixing. The tops of the shaped loaves should be rolled in additional onion  topping before the final rise.

                        *****

I was running short of flour the other day but I though I had three cups and started a loaf of bread. Well I found I only had slighly more then 2 cups. So I added a cup of pancake mix (mostly flour right?) I got a real interesting loaf of bread, it smelled and tasted like fresh pancakes. So if you like pancakes try it sometime, just substitute 1 cup of pancake mix for one of the three cups of flour called for in a white bread recipe.

  2           Packages  regular or quick-acting active dry yeast
  1                Cup  warm water (105 to 115F)
     1/2           Cup  sugar
     1/2           Cup  margarine or butter (1 stick) -- softened
  3                     eggs
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  1           Teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           Teaspoon  vanilla
  5               Cups  all-purpose flour (5 to 5 1/2 cups)
     1/2           Cup  golden raisins
     1/2           Cup  chopped citron
  2        Tablespoons  pine nuts or walnuts
                        Margarine or butter -- softened

Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in sugar, 1/2 cup margarine, the eggs, salt, lemon peel, vanilla and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in raisins, citron, pine nuts and enough flour to make dough easy to handle.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; gently roll in flour to coat. Knead about 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm place 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until double. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.)

Punch down dough; divide in half. Shape each half into round loaf, about 6 inches in diameter. Place each loaf in ungreased round pan, 8 x 1 1/2 inches. Cut an X shape 1/2 inch deep on top of each loaf.

Generously grease one side of a strip of heavy brown paper, about 25 x 4 inches. Fit and coil paper around inside of pan, greased side toward center, forming a collar; fasten with paper clip. Repeat for second loaf. Cover and let rise about 1 hour or until double.

Heat oven to 350F. Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Remove loaves from pans to wire rack; remove paper. Brush margarine on tops of loaves; cool.

2 loaves (16 slices each)

NOTES : This is a recipe that can be done either in a bread machine or by hand.

By hand, knead for at least 10 minutes after you have added the fruit. (Press flat, sprinkle on the fruit and nuts, fold in thirds turn 90 degrees, fold in thirds again and knead for 5 minutes, repeat the folding and knead an additional 5 minutes. This will distribute the fruit and nuts well and will give a fine crumb.

                Miscellaneous & Tips            Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole hazelnuts -- toasted*
  1                cup  whole blanched almonds -- toasted*
  1                cup  chopped dates
  1                cup  golden raisins
     1/8      teaspoon  lemon oil or 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
     1/2           cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  black pepper
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        confectioners' sugar

*Toast nuts in a preheated 350F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they're golden brown.

Lightly grease a 9-inch removable bottom pan or spring form pan, or a 9-inch round cake pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment, and grease the parchment.

Chop the hazelnuts and almonds coarsely. The easiest way to do this is to place the nuts in a heavy-duty plastic bag, and thump them with a rolling pin, the flat side of a meat tenderizer, or other heavy object.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the nuts, dates, raisins, lemon oil or rind, flour, and spices. Set aside. In a small saucepan, bring the sugar, honey and butter to a boil over medium heat, and simmer until the syrup registers about 245F (between soft and firm ball stage) on an instant-read thermometer. This will happen quite quickly, so don't leave the syrup simmering while you make a phone call or take out the trash.

Pour the syrup onto the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix thoroughly; you need to work quickly, or the mixture will harden. Scoop the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top.

Bake the panforte in a preheated 300F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to brown. Remove it from the oven, and let it rest for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan, and allow the panforte to cool to room temperature in the pan.

Turn the panforte out of the pan onto a clean work surface, and peel off the parchment paper. Sprinkle it heavily with confectioners' sugar, and cut it into small (about 1-inch square) pieces. Yield: About 5 dozen pieces

Christmas without fruitcake? Unthinkable... right? Oh, come on! Don't tell us you're one of those fruitcake haters! That gluey texture... the wonderful acrid/bitter taste of candied citrus peel... the heavy aroma of brandy... What's not to like?

Well, if you're a person who dreads the arrival of the annual brick-like fruitcake in the mail, or cringes at the sight of sliced fruitcake on the dessert table, we urge you to try this delectable Italian version. More a confection than a cake, panforte is a dense, sweet/nutty, chewy native of Siena, where its presence around Christmas time can be traced back nearly a thousand years.

                        filling) (2 to 2 1/2)

Manual Method: In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients (except the 4 tablespoons butter for the filling), mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough, by hand (10 minutes) or by machine (5 minutes) till it's smooth. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients (except the butter for the filling) into the pan of your machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. About 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle, check the dough and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water; the finished dough should be soft and supple. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, and divide it into 16 pieces, shaping each piece into a ball. Allow the balls to rest for 15 minutes, covered. Stretch, pat or roll each piece of dough into a 3-inch circle, and place them on two baking sheets; you can crowd them together, as when they're folded over there'll be plenty of room for expansion.

Traditionally, these dough circles are brushed with melted butter and folded over. However, we found that as they rise and bake, they pop open at the seam and lose their shape, due to the fact the melted butter doesn't allow the dough to form a tight seal. Our preferred method is as follows: Deeply crease each circle, slightly off center, with a dough scraper or bench knife. Pinch off a 1/2-teaspoon piece of the softened butter and smear it along this crease, then fold the smaller "half" of dough over the larger half. The edges won't quite meet. Pinch the dough to form a good, tight seal, cover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow them to rise for about 1 hour. They won't double in bulk, but will become somewhat puffy; if you let them rise too much, they'll pop open in the oven.

Bake the rolls in a preheated 400F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool on a rack till they're almost completely cool; while they're still very slightly warm, place them in a closed container, such as a plastic bag. This will help keep them soft. Yield: 16 rolls

NOTES : These feather-light, buttery rolls were a 19th-century staple of the Parker House, a famous Boston hotel -- the same hotel that in 1855 created the first Boston Cream. So what makes a Parker House roll special? An off-center fold during the shaping process gives them their distinctive look and it's this shape, more than the roll's texture or flavor, that says "Parker House" to millions of roll-lovers. A bit of butter smeared in the roll's center before folding melts as it bakes, adding to the rich flavor, while an egg, milk and a fair amount of butter in the dough give it a fine and tender texture. All in all, this Boston-based roll is a true egalitarian, comfortably accompanying dishes ranging from Lobster Savannah to corned beef and cabbage.

  1            package  active dry yeast -- (2 1/2 teaspoons)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (3 1/2 to 4)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  freshly grated Parmesan

In a small bowl sprinkle the yeast over 1 1/4 cups warm water, let it proof for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy, and stir in the oil. In a large bowl whisk together 3 1/2 cups of the flour, the salt, and the Parmesan, stir in the yeast mixture, and turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough, incorporating as much of the remaining 1/2 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball, put it into an oiled bowl, and turn it to coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until it is double in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it into a 12 equal pieces, and form each piece into a ball. Transfer the rolls to a lightly oiled baking sheet and let them rise, covered loosely with a kitchen towel, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until they are almost double in bulk. Bake the rolls in the middle of a preheated 425F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden.

  3               cups  pie & pastry blend flour* or King Arthur
                        Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  2                     rounded tablespoons Lora Brody Dough
                        Relaxer(r)* OR 2 tablespoons Baker's
                        Special Dry Milk*
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  cream cheese -- (4 ounces)
     1/2           cup  lard or vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  cold water -- (1/4 to 1/3)

Place the flour, Dough Relaxeacups of mini-muffin pans to make mini-quiche-type appetizers, to form crescent-shaped turnovers, or to form "purses" (see following recipe). To make mini-quiches or turnovers, dust a clean work surface and one piece of the dough with flour. Roll the dough 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 3-inch rounds. If you're making mini-quiches, press the rounds into the cups of a mini-muffin pan, and spoon approximately 1 tablespoon filling into each cup. If you're making turnovers, just leave them flat on your work surface. Spoon approximately 1 tablespoon of filling on each piece of pastry. Fold over and pinch or press edges together to form half-moon turnovers. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Place the turnovers on an ungreased baking sheet, and snip a small hole in the center of each one, for the steam to escape. Bake the mini-quiches or turnovers in a preheated 375F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they're lightly browned. Serve them warm.

Appetizers made with this dough may be frozen either baked or unbaked. To bake unbaked turnovers direct from the freezer, allow an extra 5 minutes. To reheat baked, frozen turnovers, cover with foil and reheat at 350F for 10 to 15 minutes. Uncover the turnovers for the last few minutes, so that they'll become crisp.

Yield: dough for approximately 24 turnovers or tarts.

  1                cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

*There's no need to peel the fruit; just puree it well in a blender or food processor.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and butter, then add the egg, beating till smooth.

Add the pear puree, flour, ground ginger, baking soda, baking powder, salt and vanilla. Beat till smooth. Stir in the candied ginger and nuts.

Spoon the batter into an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 55 minutes to 1 hour, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Remove the pan from the oven, and cool the loaf in the pan for 15 minutes. Gently remove the loaf from the pan and cool it completely on a wire rack. Yield: sixteen 1/2-inch slices

This dense, moist quick bread showcases the spicy bite of candied ginger. It's not a high- riser, so don't expect the usual dome-shaped loaf. Instead, this bread rises like a river, even all the way across, and slices into lovely thin rectangles, ideal for spreading with some candied-ginger-spiked cream cheese.

We've used Bosc pears as the fruit here, but peaches, nectarines, plums, bananas, or even applesauce would be just as suitable. We haven't tried it with zucchini, which is probably ubiquitous in everyone's garden right now, but we imagine that, with a suitable increase in sugar, even that might work.

     1/4           cup  sugar
  4                     pears -- (4 to 5)

Crust: In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cloves and cinnamon. Stir in the hazelnuts and sugar.

Add the vanilla, lemon oil or peel, the butter and the egg yolk. Blend until the dough is smooth. Form the dough into a flattened ball and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and allow it to soften for half an hour. Press the dough into the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Bake it in a preheated 450F oven for 18 minutes, or until bubbly and brown around the edges.

Remove the crust from the oven and allow it to cool before filling.

Filling: In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and yolk. Add the cream, milk, rum and sugar, stirring just to combine; you don't want the mixture to become frothy.

Peel, halve, and core the pears. Slice each in half longitudinally, so that they retain their pear shape. Place the pear halves atop the cooled crust, stem-ends pointing towards the center.

Pour the custard over the pears. Bake the cake in a preheated 325F oven for 40 minutes, or until set. Let the cake cool for 15 minutes before serving. Yield: 16 servings

NOTES : Pears are a rather underutilized fruit in baking. Who ever thinks to make pear pie? Or pear muffins? Yet they're as versatile as apples to bake with, and in fact can be used in any recipe calling for apples. They have a strong, distinctive, yet subtle flavor, which teams particularly well with both ginger and vanilla, as well as a variety of spirits -- rum, pear liqueur (naturally) and brandy.

  1                cup  King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped, OR 1 cup
                        pecan meal

Manual/Mixer Method: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or the bowl of your electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients. Stir the mixture together, using your hands, a spoon, or your mixer, till the dough forms a shaggy mass that begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.

Knead the dough, by hand or mixer, for about 10 minutes, till it's become smooth. Transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, at least 1 hour.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine. Program the machine for manual or dough, and press Start. Examine the dough about midway through the kneading cycle; it should be stiff but smooth, not gnarly. Adjust the consistency with additional water or bread flour, as needed. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, shape it into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch or 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. If you use the smaller pan, the bread will rise very high and a bit outwards, forming a slight "mushroom" shape. Using the larger pan will yield a loaf that's shorter and wider. Tent the dough with lightly greased plastic wrap, or with a dough rising cover, and allow it to rise till it's crowned about 1 inch over the rim of the smaller pan, or has just cleared the rim of the larger pan, about 45 minutes.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes. The interior temperature of the finished loaf should register 190F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, remove it from the pan, and place it on a wire rack to cool. While the bread is hot, lightly brush it with butter or margarine, or spray it with butter-flavored pan spray; this will keep the crust soft and give it a nice satiny shine.

Yield: 1 loaf

NOTES : Whole wheat bread is one of the recipes for which we receive the most customer requests, and we're happy to oblige with yet another one here. Have you ever noticed whole wheat bread's magical transformation in the toaster? Now, you may be a fan of whole wheat bread au naturel, sliced from the loaf and made into a sandwich, or eaten plain. But if you're lukewarm about plain whole wheat bread, try it toasted -- what a difference! The naturally sweet, nutty flavor of the wheat is brought out by the toaster's heat, and the aroma as well as the taste of whole wheat toast brings home once again why wheat is the world's second most popular grain (rice earning top honors). A brunch array of toasts -- whole wheat, oatmeal and cinnamon -- will bring out the appetite in even the pickiest breakfast eater.

  1               Tbsp  Water

Makes 2 loaves.

Place 1/4 cup warm water in large warm bowl. Sprinkle in yeast; stir until dissolved. Add remaining water, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and 2 cups flour; blend well. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

In small bowl, combine remaining oil, parsley, Parmesan cheese, basil, and garlic; set aside.

Punch dough down. Remove dough to lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each half to 15- x 12-inch rectangle. Spread each with half of basil mixture to within 1/2 inch of edges. Beginning at long end of each, roll up tightly as for jelly roll. Pinch seams and ends to seal. Taper ends by gently rolling back and forth. Place loaves, seam sides down, on large greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. With sharp knife, make one lengthwise cut (1/8 inch deep) on top of each loaf to within 1 inch of ends. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Brush egg white mixture on loaves.

Bake at 400F for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Remove from sheet; let cool on wire racks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  firmly packed fresh basil leaves
  1             cloves  garlic -- (1 to 2)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  walnuts (or almonds)
  2                     medium-ripe tomatoes
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella -- cheddar, or
                        Monterey Jack cheese
                        Freshly ground black pepper

First, make the pesto. Wash and pat dry the basil. Remove the stems. Put the oil and garlic in a food processor, and blend until the garlic is finely minced. Add the basil leaves and the nuts. Pulse the food processor until the basil and nuts are finely minced, but haven't become a paste. (If you don't have a food processor, just dice the garlic and basil as finely as possible.)

Slice the tomatoes. Spread half of the pesto on each partially baked pizza, top with half the cheese, and arrange the tomato slices on top. Sprinkle with black pepper. Finish baking the pizza as directed in the basic crust recipe. Yield: 2 pizzas.

NOTES : We figured we'd give everyone a chance to share their favorite pesto recipe -- this one is Sue's. Pesto, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella is a delightful combination, and mirrors closely pizza alla Margherita, a basil, tomato and mozzarella pizza created in Naples in 1889 to honor Queen Margherita, the consort of Italy's King Umberto.

NOTES : Pissaladiare, a specialty of Nice, on the southern French coast, traditionally includes anchovies, black olives and a large quantity of onions. We've substituted salty capers for the salty anchovies (though you may add anchovies, too, if you're a fan), and tempered the pizza with fennel and goat cheese.

                International Breads            Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1             packet  or scant tablespoon active dry yeast
  5 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All Purpose Flour -- (5 1/2
                        to 6 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil in place of an equal amount of -- (2 to 4)
                        water
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil (or 2 teaspoons dried)
  2        tablespoons  fresh oregano (or 2 teaspoons dried)

Pitas are best made ahead of time so they'll have a chance to cool and deflate before you fill them. So if you're going biking or hiking on the weekend, you'll probably want to make them up during the week.

If you work away from home during the day or even if you work at home, you can make up a sponge, with about half the flour with the olive oil and herbs added. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Add 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour. Stir with a whisk and let sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to get going. When you get back to the sponge later on, add the salt and enough flour to make a dough that is a bit stiff, one that you can easily knead by hand.

Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and knead it until it is smooth and bouncy, adding only enough more flour to keep it from sticking to the board or you. Give it a rest for about 5 minutes to relax the gluten and make it more cooperative about being shaped. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Flatten each piece with your hand and then roll each piece with a floured rolling pin, or a pin with a cover, on a floured surface into a circle about 6-inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. You may need to let the pieces rest occasionally to relax the dough.

Sprinkle baking sheets with cornmeal, and place two circles on each. Or place circles on pieces of parchment paper. Let the dough circles rest here for at least 15 minutes while you preheat your oven to a hot 500F.

When the pita circles have finished resting, place the baking sheet on the oven bottom or, if this is not possible, on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, make sure it's on the oven floor, or on the lowest rack. Use a peel to transfer the pitas-on-parchment to the stone. Close the oven door and keep it shut for 1 minute. Don't peek or the pocket may not form. It's this initially fast, hot searing of the outside dough of the pita that makes it separate from the inside. The carbon dioxide gas created by the yeast expands inside and accentuates the separation until the pita blows up like a balloon and the pocket is created.

At the end of the minute, place the sheet on a rack higher in the oven and continue baking anywhere from 3 to 7 minutes, until the pitas have blown up into balloons and are lightly browned. If the pitas baked right on the stone, you'll probably want to transfer them to a baking sheet, which is already in place on the oven rack, for this second part of their baking. When they're done, remove the baking sheet from the oven, slide the pitas off and let them cool. They will probably deflate somewhat after cooling. Once they're thoroughly cool you can press more air out of them so they take up less storage room.

NOTES : If there are any breads that are designed for summer living, they're the oldest breads in the world, the ones that are flat, portable and quick to cook. Pitas are a great container for a meal on the go.

  2        tablespoons  fresh dill weed (or seeds)

Put the water into a mixing bowl and in it dissolve the sugar and yeast. When the yeast is working, blend in the yogurt and three cups of flour. Stir in the dill, cover the sponge and let it go to work.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              cups.  bread flour
  1              cups.  whole-wheat flour
  1       tablespoons.  vital wheat gluten
  2       tablespoons.  sugar
  1       tablespoons.  salt
     1/2          tsp.  ground ginger
                        ---
  1              Tbsp.  active dry yeast
                        -- (I use rapid-rise)
                        ---
  3              Tbsp.  olive oil
  1              cups.  lukewarm water
                        ---
  6              Tbsp.  olive oil
                        -- (approximately)
                        ---
                        Desired pizza toppings

Yield:  1 12-16" crust

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine all dry ingredients except yeast into large mixing bowl. Add yeast and combine thoroughly. Add water and olive oil; mix only until dough starts to form a ball and mixer begins to labor a bit -- approximately 10-20 seconds.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 7-9 minutes. Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. You may repeat for a second rising, but it is not necessary for pizza dough.

Preheat oven to 500F for a minimum of 20 minutes (if using bread stone, preheat for at least 30 minutes to allow bread stone to reach proper temperature).

Punch down dough and shape into a ball; let rest for 10-20 minutes. Roll out to desired thickness to fit pan, or to size desired. Ensure that the outer edges of dough are slightly thicker so that toppings do not drip off during baking. Brush dough all over with olive oil. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location until dough has risen slightly (about 20-25 minutes).

Turn heat down to 425F (or 375 if using convection); immediately uncover dough and place into oven for 10 minutes. Remove dough from oven; place toppings on pizza. Place pizza back into oven for approximately 25 minutes, or until toppings start to bubble and edge of crust begins to brown slightly.

Cut into wedges and serve immediately.
VARIATION #1:

To make a nice herbed pizza crust, add dried or fresh herbs along with the dry ingredients when mixing. These might include herbs such as basil, thyme, oregano, parsley, rosemary, and sage in the quantities that you like best. Alternately, you may wish to use an Italian herb mix which already contains various herbs. If the mix includes salt be sure to reduce the amount of salt you add in the recipe, perhaps cutting it in half.

VARIATION #2:

Pizza doesn't have to be round like many of the pies you see in restaurants! If you don't have a round pizza pan, just press the dough into a square jelly roll pan. For a deep-dish pizza, you may even want to use a 9x13 brownie pan. Using a square pan makes it easier to cut into even-sized squares when it's finished baking.

  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley -- dried or fresh
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt (more or less -- to taste)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4       large cloves  garlic
  1                can  tomato sauce -- (16 ounces)
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     2/3           cup  sliced black olives
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
  1              large  green bell pepper

For Crust: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the butter (with a fork, pastry blender, your fingers or a mixer) until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle vinegar and water, a bit at a time, over flour mixture, stirring until mixture just holds together. Pat and squeeze into a flat disk and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

For Filling: Beat the eggs, and stir in the ricotta cheese, onion, Parmesan, parsley, salt and pepper. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a frying pan. Crush or dice the garlic, and add it to the hot oil, frying until golden. Stir in the tomato sauce, sugar, oregano and basil*. Add olives. Simmer for 5 minutes.

Core and seed the green pepper, and slice into thin matchsticks.

To Assemble: Divide the crust in two pieces, making one piece just slightly larger than the other. Roll out the smaller piece and fit into a 10" pie pan**. Sprinkle a little milk (about 1 teaspoon) into the crust, and spread it around with your fingers; this helps seal the crust and keeps it from becoming soggy.

Spread half of the ricotta-Parmesan mixture into the crust. Sprinkle on half the mozzarella, then spread with half the sauce, and top with half the green pepper. Repeat layers.

Roll out the top crust, and place it over the bottom crust and filling, pinching all around to seal securely. Use a sharp knife to make three parallel slashes in the top crust.

Bake in a preheated 425F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until crust is golden and filling is bubbling. Remove from oven and let stand at least 30 minutes before serving (if you don't wait, your filling ingredients will flow like lava as soon as you slice the pie). Store in the refrigerator; serve warm, at room temperature or cold.

*If you wish to skip all this, simply substitute a 16-ounce jar of spaghetti or pizza sauce for the oil, garlic, tomato sauce, sugar and spices.

**You can also use a 10-inch springform pan.

Note: Sliced pepperoni is a nice addition to the filling.

NOTES : Pizza rustica is a savory, deep-dish pie, native to Italy, which bears little resemblance to the flat pizzas we're used to in this country. The traditional pizza rustica incorporates ham, cheese, eggs and a white sauce in a rich pastry shell. However, there are as many variations on this dish as there are Italian bakers! This version, featuring a buttery crust and vegetable-cheese filling, has been a take-along favorite of ours for some years now. Bake it, enjoy some warm from the oven (not hot; let it cool a bit so the cheeses settle), then refrigerate the remainder to pack on a picnic.

                             Plain Pita Bread

                Hand Made                       International Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1             packet  or scant tablespoon active dry yeast
  5 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All Purpose Flour
                        -- (5 1/2 to 6 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  salt

Pitas are best made ahead of time so they'll have a chance to cool and deflate before you fill them. So if you're going biking or hiking on the weekend, you'll probably want to make them up during the week.

If you work away from home during the day or even if you work at home, you can make up a sponge, with about half the flour. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Add 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour. Stir with a whisk and let sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to get going. When you get back to the sponge later on, add the salt and enough flour to make a dough that is a bit stiff, one that you can easily knead by hand.

Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and knead it until it is smooth and bouncy, adding only enough more flour to keep it from sticking to the board or you. Give it a rest for about 5 minutes to relax the gluten and make it more cooperative about being shaped. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Flatten each piece with your hand and then roll each piece with a floured rolling pin, or a pin with a cover, on a floured surface into a circle about 6-inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. You may need to let the pieces rest occasionally to relax the dough.

Sprinkle baking sheets with cornmeal, and place two circles on each. Or place circles on pieces of parchment paper. Let the dough circles rest here for at least 15 minutes while you preheat your oven to a hot 500F.

When the pita circles have finished resting, place the baking sheet on the oven bottom or, if this is not possible, on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, make sure it's on the oven floor, or on the lowest rack. Use a peel to transfer the pitas-on-parchment to the stone. Close the oven door and keep it shut for 1 minute. Don't peek or the pocket may not form. It's this initially fast, hot searing of the outside dough of the pita that makes it separate from the inside. The carbon dioxide gas created by the yeast expands inside and accentuates the separation until the pita blows up like a balloon and the pocket is created.

At the end of the minute, place the sheet on a rack higher in the oven and continue baking anywhere from 3 to 7 minutes, until the pitas have blown up into balloons and are lightly browned. If the pitas baked right on the stone, you'll probably want to transfer them to a baking sheet, which is already in place on the oven rack, for this second part of their baking. When they're done, remove the baking sheet from the oven, slide the pitas off and let them cool. They will probably deflate somewhat after cooling. Once they're thoroughly cool you can press more air out of them so they take up less storage room.

NOTES : Pita bread is another ancient flat bread made from the same sort of dough that pizza and focaccia is. It's the way it's baked that creates the pocket. Here's a recipe for the kind of pita you'll find on the grocery shelf. (For those of you who are aficionados of whole wheat flour, you can substitute 1 or 2 cups of King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour for an equal amount of King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour (just remember to put the whole wheat flour in the sponge).

                Rolls                           Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
                        King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- (1/2 stick) melted

Place all of the ingredients in a blender in the order indicated above. Blend for 30 seconds, stopping midway through to scrape down the sides of the jar. Allow the batter to rest for 15 minutes, while you preheat your oven to 450F.

Grease 12 muffin cups thoroughly, greasing the area around the cups as well as the cups themselves. Use solid shortening, or non-stick vegetable oil spray. Fill the cups about two-thirds full with the batter. Bake the popovers for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350F and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Resist the urge to open the oven door at any time during this process. Remove the baked popovers form the oven, allow them to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then gently turn them out of the pan to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm; they're quite rich and don't really need butter. But there really isn't much that's quite so satisfying, visually or taste-wise, as a cold pat of butter melting into the soft, golden interior folds of a popover. Yield: 12 popovers.

NOTES : We like the following recipe because it's easily made, doesn't require a popover pan, and makes an even dozen popovers. Add a teaspoon of dried mixed herbs, if you like, or some minced onions or grated cheese; be aware, though, that anything other than the herbs will weigh the popovers down, increasing the chance they won't rise very high.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  non-instant dry milk powder (This is -- you can omit
                        it, or use 1 cup of milk in place of one
                        of the cups of water. You may wish
                        to scald the milk first to inhibit any
                        enzymes in the milk that may
                        interfere with yeast activity.)
                        optional
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/4           cup  poppy seeds
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  3               cups  King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat or
                        -- 100% White Whole Wheat Flour

Pour the water into a large bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top and stir with a whisk until dissolved.

Add the brown sugar and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Let this sit for about 10 minutes, to give the yeast a chance to get started.

Stir the dry milk, the salt, the poppy seeds and 1 cup of the unbleached flour together and add to the yeast mixture. Stir until well combined. Add the rest of the flours, a cup at a time, stirring well after each addition, until the dough has pulled away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead it, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free spot and let rise until it has doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a floured counter. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each into a rope 24 inches long. Cut each rope into 24 one-inch pieces. Roll each piece into a round ball and place on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. The rolls need to be two inches apart.

Spray the rolls with water and let rise for about 30 minutes, until they're a little swollen. Preheat the oven to 400F while the rolls are rising. Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, or until well-browned and baked through. Cool on racks. Yield: 48 rolls

NOTES : These are tiny 2-inch rolls like the ones that you find in restaurants. They have a touch of sweetness from the brown sugar, and are especially delicious when served piping hot. While I love little rolls, you can certainly make larger rolls or loaves as well. If you choose to make larger breads, the only adjustment you need to make is in the baking time. A 4-inch roll will take about 25 minutes, while two standard loaves will take 35 to 40 minutes.

*Not having port on hand in our test kitchen, we substituted a combination of 4 1/2 teaspoons red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon) and 1 1/2 teaspoons brandy for each 2 tablespoons port, which seemed to work well.

Base: Preheat the oven to 350F. In a medium-sized bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat well. Stir in the milk and 2 tablespoons port.

In a separate bowl, combine the nuts, flour, baking powder and salt. Fold the nut mixture into the butter mixture, mixing only until all ingredients are incorporated. Spread the batter into a lightly greased 9 x 9-inch pan.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and immediately brush the bars with the remaining 2 tablespoons port. Cool to room temperature.

Glaze: When the bars are cool, mix the butter, salt, sugar and port together, using additional liquid if necessary to achieve a spreadable consistency. Cover the bars evenly with the glaze, sprinkle with the ground walnuts, and let stand until the glaze is firm. Cut into squares when completely cool. Yield: 30 squares

An intriguing name, we thought, to begin a journey, one that begged, "Try me!" So we did, and when these sophisticated little squares emerged from the test kitchen with their very moist base, intriguing depth of flavor, and frosting ingeniously colored in a lovely pastel pink, they seemed a perfectly appropriate choice for an issue embracing both springtime and teatime.

Susan Kent, leader of our customer service team here at The Baker's Catalogue, was so enamored of the frosting that she vowed to make it at home that very evening. She applauded all three versions of the squares we tested, and generously bestowed upon them the compliment of "melt-in-your-mouth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  baking potato -- peeled and coarsely
                        chopped
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  skim or whole milk
  1            package  active dry yeast
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

Boil the potato for 15 to 20 minutes, until it's very tender. Drain the potato but reserve the potato water and let it cool.

Combine the potato, butter, sugar, and salt. Mix thoroughly. Gradually add 3 tablespoons of the milk and beat until the mixture is very smoothly pureed. Blend in the remaining milk.

Combine the yeast and 3/4 cup of the potato water in a large bowl, stirring until yeast is dissolved. Set aside for 5 minutes.

Stir in the potato mixture. Beat vigorously for 10 minutes, gradually adding 3 cups of the flour. Continue to beat and add flour until dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn out on a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for 5 to 8 minutes, until it's smooth and elastic, adding flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.

Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough in bowl, turning the ball over to coat completely. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk -- about 1 hour.

Grease two 9 x 5-inch loaf pans.

Punch down the dough. Divide in half, shape into loaves, and put in the pans. Cover with a tea towel and let rise again until doubled in bulk -- 40 to 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Dust loaves slightly with flour before you bake (this gives them a more rustic look).

Bake for about 40 minutes, until they are well browned. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

                        -- (approximately)
  2              pkgs.  dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  butter -- (1/2 stick)

* (WARNING:  I have a note written to myself on a post-it note on  this page, saying that even 1 1/2 cup water was too much.)

Boil the peeled potatoes in the water. Add nothing to the potatoes during cooking. Pour off the liquid and reserve. (The recipe says to add more water if necessary to get 1 3/4 cups potato water. I haven't made this in a while, but I think that what I used to do was just use whatever water was left after cooking the potatoes and that was probably plenty.) Rice or mash the potatoes and set aside.

Measure 3 cups flour into a mixing or mixer bowl, and add the yeast, salt, and sugar. Blend. Into a saucepan pour the potato water, the butter, and potatoes. Place over medium heat until the liquid is hot (120 degrees) to the touch, and the butter has softened or melted. Add to the flour mixture.

Add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, to form a rough mass, and beat with a wooden spoon for 100 strokes or use a dough hook for 3 minutes in the mixer until the dough is smooth. Knead for 10 minutes.

Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 1 1/2 hr. or until doubled in volume.

Punch down dough and divide into two equal pieces. Shape into loaves and allow to rise again for about 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400F before baking.

Bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 and continue baking 25 minutes or until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when the bottom crust is tapped.


I used to cut this recipe in half and make it in the food processor, which made the liquid amount much easier to deal with--I just added whatever was necessary to give the dough the right consistency. I'm sure that's why I haven't had any trouble with the recipe even though I think the flour/liquid ratio is off. You might want to make it in the food processor, too, if you have one, especially if yours is big enough to accomodate the entire recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  1                cup  unseasoned lukewarm mashed potatoes
     2/3           cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  shortening
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
  6               cups  all-purpose flour -- * (6 to 7)

* if using self-rising flour, omit salt

In this, my first attempt to make these rolls......I was looking for a very rich dough....so I cut back on the amount of water called for to 3/4 cup and used about 6 cups of flour including that needed for the kneading process. I also used the water in which the potatoes were cooked as the "water ingredients." Next time I might cut back even more on the water to 2/3 cup as the dough was very slack and a little difficult to work with, particularly in forming the roll recipe.

You can substitute 3 to 4 cups whole wheat flour for the second addition of the all-purpose.

Disolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in potatoes, sugar, shortening, eggs, salt and 3 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth. Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth & elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turn greased side up. Cover bowl tightly and refrigerate at least 8 hours but no longer than 5 days.

Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal parts. Use 1/4 of the dough for any dinner roll recipe.

Bread loaf was made 3 days after preparing the dough.

Removed 1/2 of the total dough from the refrigerator and allowed to come to room temperature about 1 1/2 hours. Turned the dough out on a floured board and punched down. Allowed to rest several minutes then kneaded it for another few minutes. Placed the dough in an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 3 inch loaf pan which had been well greased with Crisco. Sprayed the top with olive oil, covered and allowed to rise about 1 1/2 hours. In my case the dough did not rise above the rim of the pan. Brushed the top with melted butter and baked in a preheated oven about 40 minutes at 365F (that's correct, 365F). Tested with instant read thermometer. It reached the required 190F in the 40 minutes
baking time. Brushed top of loaf as soon as it came out of the oven.

The aroma of this bread baking was so seductive that as soon as I removed it from the pan I just had to taste it, despite all the rules that say "allow to come to room temperature." The first two slices cut very easily while still hot and what a delightful taste: very yeasty and extremely light.

NOTES : Because I love bread using potatoes my first choice was the Refrigerator Roll Dough which called for potatoes as an ingredient. I found this recipe excellent. The recipe calls for using 1/4 of the recipe to make about 6-8 rolls. Remainder of the dough can be kept up to five days. After the 2nd day of making rolls thought I'd try making the last half as a loaf bread. What a wonderful surprise. Delicious.

Here is the method I used. Used KitchenAid for mixing and kneading.

                        Dissolve:
  3                pkg  dry yeast in
  1                cup  lukewarm water
                        ---
                        Mix in large bowl:
  1                 qt  scalded milk
  2               cups  mashed potatoes
                         -- (no milk or butter)
  1                cup  butter and margarine
                        -- 1/2 cup each
  1                cup  sugar
                        ---
                        Let cool to lukewarm then add:
                        Yeast mixture
  6               cups  flour
                        Let stand until mixture foams
                        -- (about 20 minutes)
                        ---
                        Add:
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  salt
  11              cups  flour -- (11 to 12)
                        -- (a little more or less
                        -- the dough should be soft)

Turn out onto floured board and knead until satiny. Let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. The dough then may be used to form doughnuts, cinnamon buns, sticky buns, or dinner rolls, which are covered and left to rise until not quite doubled.

The doughnuts then are fried in hot shortening at 375 degrees. When drained and while still hot, they are dipped into a glaze of one's choice and a chopstick is inserted through the holes so a number of doughnuts drain over the bowl of glaze until the next doughnuts are ready to be dipped.

The cinnamon buns, sticky buns, and dinner rolls are baked at 400 degrees for approximately 8 minutes on the lower oven rack, then shifted to the upper rack for approximately another 8-10 minutes.

Coffee cake may be made by putting leftover bits of dough into a greased pan. Dab or punch holes in the dough, spread with butter, and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Let rise until not quite double, then bake as described in the paragraph above.

When I make this wonderful potato dough, I divide it into fourths and make a batch each of doughnuts, cinnamon buns, sticky buns, and dinner rolls, and create a coffee cake with the leftover dough scraps.

The yield of the productive day may be frozen after the baked goods have cooled. Wrap them well and place in large plastic bags.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --YEAST:--
  2              Pkgs.  dry yeast
  1           Teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           Cup  warm water
                        --DOUGH:--
  5               Cups  flour -- 4 cups to start
                        -- adding additional flour as needed
  1 1/4           Cups  warm milk
     1/2           Cup  softened butter or margarine
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2           Cup  sugar
  2        Tablespoons  dark rum -- (or vanilla)
  1                     grated lemon rind
  1              Pinch  salt
                        --FILLING:--
  6               Cups  finely ground walnuts
                        -- ( approx. 1-1/2 to 1 3/4 pound)
  1                Cup  finely ground golden raisins
     1/2           Cup  white sugar
     1/2           Cup  brown sugar
  2        Tablespoons  dry bread crumbs
     1/2      Teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      Teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2           Cup  honey
     3/4           Cup  thick cream -- (or 1/2 and 1/2)
     1/2           Cup  butter -- (or margarine)
  3                     egg whites -- beaten stiff

Yeast:

Sprinkle sugar over yeast and add warm water. Let it stand until twice its original volume.

Dough:

Mix softened butter, sugar and egg yolks until the sugar is well dissolved and mixture is frothy. Set aside. Warm up the milk, mix in salt, lemon peel, and rum, and add to the butter mixture. Form the dough out of the 4 cups of flour, yeast, and milk mixtures. The trick is not to pour in all the milk mixture immediately; use about 3/4 to start with, then add more as the dough forms.

Beat with electric mixer until smooth and elastic. Then keep adding flour as needed, and mixing with a wooden spoon until of consistency that dough can be handled without sticking. Place dough on floured board and knead for about 15 minutes, adding flour as needed to make a non-sticking dough. Place dough in a well-greased bowl; turn dough upside down to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours until double in bulk. While dough is rising, prepare filling.

Filling:

Mix walnuts and raisins, and grind them together to keep raisins from clumping. Combine all dry ingredients. Warm the cream and honey, and melt the butter in this mixture. Add cream mixture to dry ingredients and mix completely. Fold in beaten egg whites last. Let filling cool as you roll out dough.

Assembly:

Roll out dough on table covered with a tablecloth well sprinkled with flour. Roll out to 1/4" thick, 18" x 24" or bigger. Spread cooled filling over entire dough evenly. Start rolling up dough by hand, jelly roll fashion, stretching dough slightly with each roll. Start at an 18" edge and roll in the 24" direction. Keep side edges as even as possible. Continue to roll by raising the cloth edge slowly with both hands so the dough rolls itself. Dust away any excess flour on the outside of the dough with a pastry brush as you roll. Prick roll with a toothpick as needed to eliminate air pockets.

With the edge of a spatula (pancake flipper) cut off each end of roll to make it the length needed to fit around the inside of an angel food cake pan. Place in well-greased angel food cake pan or Bundt cake pan, being sure to arrange the seam where the roll ended against the center. If you have a two-piece angel food cake pan, it is easiest to roll the loaf onto and around the bottom plate of the pan, and then lower this into the body of the pan. Cover with a cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in volume. Bake about 1 hour at 325F.

Put cut-off ends in greased loaf pans, cover with cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in volume, then bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 325F.

For a shiny crust, brush top before baking with 1 egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon milk, OR brush top with melted butter when taken from oven.

Let stand one hour before removing from pan. Loosen sides and bottom with knife. Turn onto wire rack to remove, then turn over again onto another wire rack to cool right-side up.

Once completely cool, turn upside-down on a cake plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Potica (paw tee' tzah) is a traditional Slovenian holiday cake. Variations of it are also common in several other Eastern European countries. When my Polish house cleaner saw it on the counter, she said, 'Oh. Christmas Cake!'

Some of my fondest childhood memories are of being at my grandmother's house and helping with the potica, and then enduring the smell for hours before it was done and cool enough to eat. My grandmother came over from the old country when she was twenty, and lived in a Slovenian neighborhood in my hometown, and could she make a tremendous potica! Well, my grandmother has been gone for twenty years, but when I ran across a recipe for potica on the Slovenia home page, I had to try it. And I was disappointed. It just wasn't the same as my grandmother's.

So I challenged my mother to remember how her mother had made it. And we looked up a dozen or more recipes in cookbooks and from other family members and friends. And we made several poticas, refining the recipe until we had it right. And now I can make potica as good as grandma's.

The smell takes me back to my childhood and her kitchen, and so she is with me still. And my child will take the smell with him, too, but this time he will have the recipe!

One thing to note. Potica is supposed to rise very high, topping out an angel food cake pan. In Slovenia they use special ceramic pans which are higher still. To get the rise you should have, the ingredients, the bowls, and the pans should all be warm, at least room temperature, and the kitchen should best be very warm as well. This way your potica won't catch a chill and fail to rise to expectations.

Measurements are all in English units, but the Slovenia home page has conversions to metric and traditional Slovenian units.

  2               Tbsp  Water
                        Black Caraway Seeds

This recipe can be made in the bread machine, in the food processor or by
hand.  If using the mixer or processor be very careful not to add
enough  flour to form a discreet ball of dough as this will make for a dry
loaf of bread.

Note 1: (this is not rapid rise, but instantly  dissolving) such as Red
Star or SAf Instant
Note 2: or extra to make a soft, smooth ball of dough after the first 5-7
minutes of kneading

Stand mixer: place all the dry ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook.  With the machine on lowest speed, add the remaining
ingredients except the egg white and caraway seeds.  Increase the speed to
medium and knead 5-7 minutes, adding more liquid if necessary to make a
slack, moist dough which will not form a discreet ball.  Cover the dough
and allow it to rise until almost double in bulk.  Punch down the dough and
knead for another 4-5 minutes.  Allow the dough to rest, covered for 10
minutes before shaping and baking (see below).*

Food processor: Place all the dry ingredients in a large, heavy duty food
processor fitted with the plastic blade.  With the processor on add the wet
ingredients except the egg white and caraway seeds.  Process for 60
seconds. The dough should be very moist and slack - it will not form a
discreet ball. Allow the dough to rise in the processor or in a covered,
oiled bowl, until double in bulk, then process for an additional 60
seconds.  Remove the dough to a lightly floured work space, cover and allow
it to rest for 15 minutes

Bread machine: Place all the ingredients except the egg white and seeds in
the bread machine and program for DOUGH using the Whole Wheat Setting if
available.  Watch the dough forming during the first few minutes of
the  kneading cycle, adding additional water or white flour as needed to
form a smooth, moist, supple ball.  At the end of the final cycle, remove
the dough to a lightly floured work surface.*

To complete: Sprinkle a heavy duty baking sheet with cornmeal.  Form the
dough into a low, round loaf, cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise in
a warm place until doubled in bulk.  Preheat the oven to 375F with the rack
in the center position.  Glaze with the egg wash and sprinkle with the
seeds. Bake for 30-45 minutes or until the bottom sounds hollow when tapped
and the top crust is quite firm, or until the internal temperature of the
loaf is 190F on an instant read thermometer.

*The taste and texture of all doughs and this one in particular will
benefit from an additional long, slow, cool rise.  If you have the time,
after the final rise and before shaping, place the dough in a large-sized
zip lock bag and place it in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours, then proceed
with the shaping and baking.

NOTES : Like all hearty dark grain loaves, pumpernickel bread is best not over
risen. This version is dense and moist and makes a compact, finely textured
loaf. The flavor and texture are developed with multiple kneads and a long,
slow cool rise before the bread is shaped for the final rise and baking*.
Don't be tempted to rush the process or you'll end up with a brick.
Pumpernickel flour is a medium grind rye flour which contains almost no
gluten and will not rise unless combined with other flour (such as
white).  The traditionally added black caraway is available in specialty
food stores and by mail order from King Arthur.  Altus is a mash made by
soaking small pieces of stale sour rye bread in water overnight in the
refrigerator and then squeezing out the excess liquid.

                       Pumpkin Nutmeg Dinner Rolls

                Rolls                           Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         ounce  active dry yeast -- (about 2 1/2
                        teaspoons)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk -- heated to lukewarm
  7               cups  all-purpose flour -- (7 to 8)
  1           teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         sticks  cold unsalted butter -- (3/4 cup) cut into
                        bits
  1        large whole  egg -- beaten lightly
  2               cups  fresh pumpkin puree
                        -- or a 16-ounce can pumpkin puree
                        egg wash:  beat
  1              large  egg yolk -- with
  1         tablespoon  water

In a small bowl proof the yeast with 1 teaspoon of the sugar in the milk for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. In a large bowl combine well 7 cups of the flour, the nutmeg, the salt, and the remaining sugar and blend in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the whole egg, the pumpkin puree, and the yeast mixture and stir the dough until it is combined well.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it, incorporating as much of the remaining 1 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball, transfer it to a well-buttered large bowl, and turn it to coat it with the butter. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a work surface, divide it into 14 pieces, and form each piece into a ball. Fit the balls into a buttered 10-inch springform pan and let them rise, covered with a kitchen towel, in a warm place for 45 minutes, or until they are almost double in bulk. Brush the rolls with the egg wash and bake them in the middle of a preheated 350F. oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Let the rolls cool slightly in the pan, remove the side of the pan, and serve the rolls warm. The rolls may be made 1 week in advance and kept wrapped well and frozen. Reheat the rolls, wrapped in foil, in a preheated 350F. oven for 25 minutes, or until they are heated through.

Makes 14 rolls.

3. Grease two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans and dust them with flour. Evenly divide the batter between the two pans. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Then remove from pans by inverting them onto a rack and tapping the bottoms. Slice and serve plain, buttered or with cream cheese.

Flatten dough into round disk; press dough into pan. Add sauce, desired toppings; sprinkle cheese over toppings. Bake in 425F oven 20 - 30 min, or until crust is brown and cheese is melted. (Timing varies according to amount and number of toppings.) Use sharp knife or pizza wheel to cut into wedges.

Add 1 Tbsp chopped fresh basil (or 2 tsp dried) and 2 cloves minced garlic after the honey.

NOTES : My mom gave me a Betty Crocker cookbook years ago, originally published in 1969. There are several rolls recipes in there, but the "Refrigerator Roll Dough" seems to be the most versatile; it has suggestions for brown and serve, casseroles, cloverleaf, crescent, etc. I won't type all the instructions for the various forms, but here's the basic recipe for the dough.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  rice flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/3           cup  non-fat dry milk
  2               cups  water
  1                     egg -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  melted butter or other shortening
                        To brush:
  1           teaspoon  melted butter

BAKING PAN
One medium (8 1/2 x 4 1/2) loaf pan, greased or Teflon.  If glass, reduce
heat in oven 25 degrees.

PREPARATION 15 mins.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Measure flour into a mixing bowl and add sugar, salt and baking powder. In another bowl, dissolve milk in water, and add the egg and butter or shortening. Gradually add the liquid ingredients to the dry mixture, stirring gently but do not overmix.

FORMING 10 mins.
Pour batter in the loaf pan, brush top with melted butter and let it rest for 5 minutes.

BAKING 375 degrees 30 mins. 350 degrees 45 mins.
Before placing the loaf pan in the oven, cover it loosely with a strip of aluminum foil which has been pierced two or three places to allow the moisture to escape. Place the pan in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes; remove foil cover; reduce temperature to 350 degrees, and continue baking for about 45 minutes more. A wooden toothpick or metal skewer inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean and dry when done. If moist particles cling to the probe, return the loaf to the oven for an additional 10 minutes.

FINAL STEP

Remove bread from the oven. This is a moist bread and fragile when hot, so carefully remove from pan and place it on wire rack to cool.

This bread should always be served warm. 	Slice the quantity needed for each meal and warm in toaster or oven to serve. Store in a plastic bag.

NOTES : A baking procedure is reversed for this unusual loaf. A piece of foil is laid over the batter-filled pan _before_ it goes into the oven, and removed at mid-point in the baking process rather than being put on late to protect the bread from overbrowning.

A fine vehicle for spreads, it has a good texture but because of its compactness it should always be toasted or served warm from the oven.

It loses its attractive qualities when it is cold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2    Tablespoon  Yeast
  2 1/4           Cups  Flour -- bread
  1         Tablespoon  Sugar
     1/2    Tablespoon  Salt
  1         Tablespoon  Oil
  1                Cup  Rice -- cooked
  1                Cup  Water

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.

For a richer bread, use 1 egg and 3/4 c water instead of 1 c water.

In hot, humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Sylvia's comment: Very soft, nice all-purpose bread. Great for sandwiches.
 WARNING: the dough will look a little "wet." DO NOT ADD EXTRA FLOUR.

NOTES : (*)If you do not have rum, use bourbon--the flavour is equally
good.

(**) I omitted the walnuts.
This is my favourite banana bread. It does not take the usual spices.  I make it with Bacardi dark rum or Vat19.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  rye flour
  3               cups  white flour
  1                tsp  sugar
  2                tsp  salt
  2               cups  whole bran cereal
                        -- (All-Bran or similar)
  2               Tbsp  caraway seeds
  2               tsp.  instant coffee
  2                tsp  onion powder
     1/2           tsp  fennel seed -- crushed
                        -- (mortar & pestle is good)
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- or 2 Tbsp. bulk active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
                        -- (the brown kind sold in pint or quart
                        jars)
     1/4           cup  molasses
                        -- (the darker the better)
  1             square  UNSWEETENED baking chocolate
     1/4           cup  margarine
                        -- (butter is utterly wasted here)
                        GLAZE:
  1               tsp.  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  water

Mix rye & white flours until evenly combined. Combine 2 1/3 cup flour mix and remaining dry ingredients (sugar, salt, bran cereal, caraway, coffee, onion powder, fennel, yeast). Heat liquid ingredients (water, vinegar, molasses) to very warm; melt chocolate & margarine in hot liquid. Add to dry ingredients in large mixing bowl. Using electric mixer, mix at high speed 2 minutes (or beat 120 strokes by hand).

Mix in enough of remaining flour mixture to form soft dough. Flour work surface with flour mixture, turn dough out and let rest 15 minutes (cover with mixing bowl to protect from drying out). Knead until smooth (dough will be a bit sticky due to rye flour) and gluten is well developed. Place in greased or sprayed bowl, turn over so greased side is up; let rise.

Shape into two rounds (these will be about 6" in diameter at this point). Spray or grease a cookie sheet; sprinkle two circles in diagonally-opposite (kitty-cornered) corners with cornmeal. Place loaves on cornmeal; leave 2" at least from sides to allow for rising expansion. Let rise until about doubled in bulk. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350*.

Bake approximately 50 minutes. Toward end of baking time, boil the cornstarch and water together for about 1 minute (mixture will thicken and turn clear). When bread is done (tap on bottom produces hollow sound), brush loaves with the glaze and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes to set glaze. Cool on racks.

(The adventuresome might want to try a dish of boiling water on the bottom of the oven ... slashing the tops in a decorative pattern ... glazing a second time when the hot loaves come out of the oven.)

NOTES : Short stuff first: the elusive rye flavor may be found in a "rye bread enhancer" available from King Arthur catalogue. It comes with a wonderful warning about being STRONG, but adds great flavor and lasts a good while.

Here's a recipe for Russian Black Bread that I've had since my Cleveland years, when I started baking yeast bread in college days. It probably is from the Cleveland Plain Dealer in the late 1960's, and is still a favorite. It calls for lots of ingredients, but each one adds to the nice, complex blend of flavors.

If you haven't worked with rye flour before, be ready for the definite difference in texture from a full-wheat bread dough. The rye dough has a slick (some might say slimy!) feel when you try to wash it off, and it stays fairly sticky during the kneading. Don't make a brick by continuing to add flour until the dough is not sticky! If it's firm enough to knead, just work it well and rejoice in the result.

                        For Poolish:
  1               tbsp  moist yeast

  3               cups  white ap flour
  2               tbsp  dough enhancer

Recipe By : Taken from Greenstein and Bernenbaum's rye bread recipe's

Combine water with yeast and sugar in 6 quart bowl. Let stand 1 minute then stir until yeast and sugar are dissolved. Add flour and stir until consistency of thick batter. You may need a bit more white ap flour. Continue stirring for 100 strokes until strands of gluten come off spoon when you press back of spoon against bowl. Scrape down sides of bowl and cover with damp towel or plastic wrap and put in moderately warm draft free place until bubbly and increased in volume (74-80 degrees). This poolish can be refrigerated overnight. Transfer poolish to 6 quart bowl. Add rye flour, caraway, oil, salt and sugar. Stir with wooden spoon until well combined. Add enough white flour to make thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto well floured surface. Knead 15-17 minutes. Dough is ready when small amount pulled from mass springs back quickly.

Shape dough into ball and let rest on lightly floured surface while you butter or Pam a large bowl. Place dough in bowl and turn to coat. Ideal is temperature is 78. Cover with damp towel or plastic wrap and put in warm (74-78) place until doubled. Try to keep at 78). (Takes about two hours)

Deflate by punching down. Reform into ball and return to bowl and cover again. Sit until doubled. (About 45 minutes)

Cut in two pieces. Place in bread pans that have been Pam'd, and let rise until doubled. (Takes 35-40 minutes)

30 minutes prior to baking, preheat oven with baking tiles in place, to 450. Scar loaves of bread with a sharp raxor blade on the diagonal. Brush loaves with corn starch mixture. One tbsp cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water. Pour into 1/2 cup boiling water and stir until boils again. Place rack in center of oven and put the bread on this. Needs lots of steam for a good crust, so spray oven before putting bread in. Repeat spray twice more at three minute intervals. Bake in bread pan for 25 minutes and then remove from pan and finish loaves directly on stone.

Using a razor blade, score loaves making shallow cuts 1/4 - inch deep along surface. Slide bread pans onto rack and quickly spray inner walls and floor of oven with cold water from spray bottle. Close door to trap steam - three minutes. Spray again and bake 12 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 and bake until loaves are rich caramel color and crust is firm, another 15-20 minutes. Tap loaves on bottom. If hollow sound - done. Cool on racks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  milk
     3/4         stick  unsalted butter -- (6 tablespoons)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast -- (2 1/2 teaspoons)
  1        large whole  egg -- beaten lightly
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (2 1/2 to 3)
     1/4           cup  minced fresh sage
                        -- or 2 tablespoons crumbled dried
                        egg wash: beat
  1              large  egg -- with
  1         tablespoon  water

In a saucepan combine the milk, 4 tablespoons of the butter, and the sugar, heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers between 110F. and 115F. on a candy thermometer, and in it proof the yeast for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Stir in the whole egg, the salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour, stirring until the mixture forms a dough. On a floured surface knead the dough, kneading in enough of the remaining 1/2 cup flour to form a soft dough, knead in the sage, and knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes more, or until it is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball, transfer it to a buttered bowl, and turn it to coat it with the butter. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk.

Punch down the dough and divide it into 36 equal pieces. Form the pieces into balls, dipping the balls as they are formed into the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, melted, and put 3 balls in each of 12 buttered 1/3-cup muffin tins. Let the rolls rise in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until they are double in bulk, brush the tops with the egg wash, being careful not to let the egg drip down the sides, and bake the rolls in the middle of a preheated 400F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden. The rolls may be made 1 day in advance and kept wrapped in foil at room temperature. Reheat the rolls, wrapped in the foil, in a preheated 350F. oven for 15 minutes, or until they are hot.

Makes 12 rolls.

NOTES : Some years ago, I asked this list for an ABM recipe for Sally Lunn. In sifting through the answers (and a few cookbooks) I realized it was a batter bread that really couldn't be made right in the bread machine. And I've been making it quite well without the machine ever since.

I picked up a little brochure called CLASSIC ESSENTIAL BREAD AND ROLLS at Powell's Bookstore last week. It's not an ABM book, but many of the recipes use 4 cups of flour, which is the capacity of my machine. And since I wanted a nice bread for breakfast company today I knew I had to make it in the machine. So I gave one more Sally Lunn recipe a try in the machine, and the results were excellent. Not the cake-like texture I've come to expect, but the flavor is wonderful and it holds together very well.

NOTES : I fiddled around and came up with this, which I thought was pretty darned good, but my mother says it comes close but gets no cigar. She's still looking for a good sour light rye. I have a suspicion it'll have to be sourdough or nothing for her, and since she can't keep a sourdough culture alive she'll always have to buy hers.
But I enjoy this bread a lot!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- For 1 1/2-lb. Loaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  granulated sugar
  2 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose or

  2               cups  sourdough starter
                        For 1-pound Loaf
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1 2/3           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose or
                        Special For Machines Bread Flour
  1 1/3           cups  sourdough starter

Place ingredients into the pan of your machine, in the order listed; program for French Bread, or a similar long-rising cycle; and press Start. This bread won't crown, but will remain flat across the top.

Sourdough may be the oldest of all leavened bread forms. It dates back to at least 4,000 B.C., when favorable microorganisms drifted accidentally into wheat bread made by Egyptians. The dough, probably set aside awhile before baking, didn't rise very much, but it was enough to give it a lighter texture and a better taste. Word of this new bread spread, and curiosity was raised. Soon, adding ferments to bread dough was a common practice. Beer, grape juice, wine, and wheat flour porridge left to "go sour" were leavening regulars in the ancient world. Still, the demanding process of leavening bread made such bread a scarce food well into the Middle Ages.

The original leavening process took many forms. The most common was to leave a piece of dough from each day's baking and incorporate it into the next day's mix. This method created the early ancestor of the sourdough starters we know and love today. Legend has it that sourdough starters made their way to America in the hold of Columbus' ship. By the mid-19th century, starters were vital to both prospectors and pioneers.

Prospectors carried the starter in their backpacks to make a batch of bread whenever the spirit and hunger moved them. This saved an arduous, if not impossible, trek to the nearest town for a bit of yeast. By 1849 sourdough had gathered fame throughout the country.

"Sourdough" even become the nickname for the California Klondike miners at the turn of the century. So important was their leavener that during the harsh winter prospectors slept with their starters to keep them from freezing. The son of an Alaskan "sourdough" wrote that every miner's cabin featured, hanging over its red-hot stove, a "tin full of fermented dough, used in place of yeast in making bread, biscuits and flapjacks". A bubbling jar or aromatic starter was also the secret weapon of many pioneer wives and bachelors in the 19th century. The jar held the key to delicious breads and biscuits when milk was as scarce as yeast. The "sponge", as it was called, was carried carefully in covered wagons and fed faithfully to keep it alive.

Much like a generous friend, the starter fed many families well. Starters were passed from friend to friend and from generation to generation. As bread made from sourdough developed its own unique flavor, it gathered a legion of defenders who created a sourdough mystique. The legion continued to grow even after yeast become readily available. For some, bread made from packaged yeast cannot duplicate the tart flavor and aroma of a sourdough bread, and these bakers remain true to that old friend who waits faithfully for them in a little jar in their refrigerator.

Basic Sourdough Bread: This following sourdough recipe was developed using the French bread cycle on the Zojirushi's 1 1/2-lb. machine. This particular cycle calls for a total of 30 minutes of kneading, a first rise of 40 minutes, and a second rise of 1 hour, 50 minutes. It's this long second rise which allows the sourdough to attain sufficient volume; if your machine doesn't have a cycle with a long second rise, you may want to increase the amount of yeast you use. The bread bakes for 60 minutes, slightly longer than the usual 55 minutes. Your machine may have a whole-grain or some other cycle which approximates the Zojirushi's French bread cycle.

NOTES : This one is a waffle recipe from the good folks at King Arthur Flour but we have been happily using it for pancakes. As far as my husband is concerned, no other pancakes even come close to these. Every year his fishing buddies demand he bring some starter and make these for their annual fishing trip.

I like to feed my starter the day before I plan to make these for breakfast so it's light and bubbly when I mix the sponge.

                        -- all-purpose can be substituted

  3       tablespoons.  soft shortening
                        -- optional in standard bread and rolls
                        -- substitute 2-3 T. good olive oil if
                        making pizza
  1              cups.  basic white sourdough starter
  1              cups.  warm water
                        -- (approx. 110-120F -- warm to the wrist)
  2              Tbsp.  lemon juice
                        -- (optional)

Yield:  2 16" pizzas
	or 3 10" pizzas
	or 2 standard-sized loaves
	or 16 rolls

If you are using a KitchenAid, knead for approximately 9 minutes by machine; otherwise, use your standard hand-kneading techniques. Place dough in a greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap or a tea towel. Place dough in a warm, draft-free location (in the summer my hot garage serves as my "proofing oven") until it has doubled in bulk. Punch down; let rise again until doubled. Punch down; divide dough into portions and shape (see notes below).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR STANDARD BREAD:

Shape into loaves and place into greased loaf pans. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or tea towel. Place in a warm location until dough has risen approximately 1/4" to 1/2" above top of loaf pan.

Bake in preheated oven at 375F for approximately 25 minutes. Remove loaves from pans; place loaves (without pans) back into oven. Bake for approximately 5-15 minutes longer until loaves are golden-brown and sound hollow when tapped.

Remove loaves from oven; place on wire racks to cool thoroughly.

NOTE: I use the basic proportions in this recipe to make most of my breads, often substituting a portion of the bread flour with whole-wheat or rye flour, adding ingredients such as cinnamon, egg, raisins, etc. You can also substitute warm milk for the warm water. I often make sweet rolls, breakfast breads, white bread, wheat bread, and so forth with the basic proportions presented here, although you may want to add a bit more sugar for some things.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR PIZZA:

I often add some Italian spices such as rosemary, basil, thyme, savory, garlic, etc. This tastes great when incorporated in the dough *as well as* sprinkled on top with other toppings. I also sometimes substitute a small amount (e.g., 1/4 cup) of cornmeal for some of the bread flour in the recipe to add a bit of texture and flavor.

Roll out dough into rounds, from 1/4" to 1/2" thick depending on how thick you like your crusts (remember to allow for rising). If you are using a pizza peel, sprinkle some cornmeal on the peel and put dough on peel before continuing; otherwise, place dough on baking sheet or pan. Prick dough all over gently -- don't make holes through bottom or topping will drip through. Brush dough lightly with olive oil, making sure to brush around edges, as well. Put toppings on dough (e.g., tomato paste, pepperoni, cheese, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, cooked sausage or hamburger, etc.) and set aside until oven is preheated.

Bake in preheated oven at 425F until crust is lightly golden and cheese starts to bubble and melt. Remove from oven; cut into sections and serve immediately.

NOTE: I find that the use of a baking stone makes a nicely finished crust on the bottom, avoiding any soggy bits inside the pizza. If you are using a stone or tiles, be sure that they are preheated thoroughly (e.g., at least 15 minutes) prior to placing the pizza on the stone or tiles.

Combine milk, 3 tablespoons butter and sugar in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until butter melts and mixture is heated through. Whisk in squash. Remove from heat and cool until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 125F to 130F, about 5 minutes.

Mix flour, yeast and salt in food processor. With machine running, add squash mixture through feed tube; process until ball forms. Continue to process 45 seconds longer to knead dough.

Butter large bowl. Add dough to bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 50 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375F. Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans. Punch down dough. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 24 equal pieces. Form each piece into ball. Arrange 12 balls in each prepared cake pan, spacing apart. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over low heat. Brush rolls with 1/3 of melted butter. Cover pans loosely with foil. Let rolls rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 20 minutes.

Brush rolls again with 1/3 of melted butter. Bake rolls uncovered until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer pans to rack. Brush rolls with remaining melted butter. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Cool rolls completely in pans. Cover pans with foil and freeze. Thaw rolls; then reheat rolls, covered in pans, in 350F oven about 10 minutes.) Serve rolls warm.

NOTES : Here's a different use for one of the ingredients from the first Thanksgiving. Though this recipe is particularly easy to prepare with frozen winter squash puree, canned pumpkin puree or mashed freshly cooked butternut squash will work just as well. The squash will impart a beautiful golden color to the rolls.

     1/2         cups.  rolled oats
     1/3         cups.  wheat bran
     1/2         cups.  brown sugar
  4               tsp.  salt -- preferably sea salt
  2              Tbsp.  instant yeast -- plus
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast
                        -- or 3 Tbsp. active dry yeast
     1/2         cups.  cooked brown rice
     1/4         cups.  honey
     3/4         cups.  buttermilk
  1 1/2          cups.  warm water
  3              Tbsp.  poppy seeds -- for loaf tops

*  (coarsely ground cornmeal, or regular grind if you can't find coarse)

MIXING
In a bowl mix 2 c. of flour and all the other dry ingredients, through yeast. Add the cooked brown rice, honey, buttermilk, and water. Beat for 2-3 minutes to mix well. With a wooden spoon, gradually add the rest of the bread flour (or as much as it takes).

KNEADING
Because Struan has so many whole grains, it takes longer to knead than most breads, usually 12 to 15 minutes by hand. The dough will change before your eyes, lightening in color, becoming gradually more elastic and evenly grained. The finished dough should be tacky but not sticky, lightly golden, stretchy and elastic rather than porridgelike. When you push the heels of your hands into the dough, it should give way but not necessarily tear. If it flakes or
crumbles, add a little more water.

PROOFING
Wash out the mixing bowl and dry it thoroughly. Put in the dough and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap or place the bowl inside a plastic bag. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, until it has roughly doubled in size.

FORMING LOAVES
This recipe makes about 5 pounds of dough (81 ounces, to be exact); to make 3 loaves of 1-1/2 lb. each, cut the dough into 3 pieces -- each will weigh 27 oz. Roll up each piece into a loaf by pressing on the center with the heels of the hands and rolling the dough back over on itself until a seam is formed. Tuck all the pieces of dough or end flaps into the seam, keeping only one seam in the dough. Pinch off the seam, sealing it as best you can, and put the loaf,
seam-side down, in a greased 9x4-1/2x3" loaf pan. Brush an egg wash solution (1 egg beaten into 4 c. water) on the top of each loaf and sprinkle the poppy seeds on top.

BAKING
Cover and allow the dough to rise till it crests over the top of the pan. Bake in a 350F oven (300F in a convection oven) for approximately 45 minutes. The loaf should dome nicely and be a dark gold. The sides and bottom should be a uniform medium gold and there should be an audible, hollow thwack when you tap the bottom of the loaf.

If the bread comes out of the pan dark on top but too light or soft on the sides or bottom, take the loaf out of the pan, return it to the oven, and finish baking until it is thwackable. Bear in mind that the bread will cook much faster once it is removed from the pan, so keep a close eye on it.

Allow the bread to cool thoroughly for at least 40 minutes before slicing it.

NOTES:  Struan is the signature bread of Brother Juniper's Bakery in Santa Rosa, California.

"Brother Juniper's Struan is made from wheat, corn, oats, brown rice, and bran. It is moistened with buttermilk and sweetened with brown sugar and honey and, as far as I know, we are the only bakers still making a Struan. Susan and I went to Scotland and could find no sign of it. We went to the National Library in Edinburgh. Some research uncovered that it originated in the Hebrides, probably on the Isle of Skye (there is a place there called Struanmoor). It worked its way to the outer island of Lewis where the Michaelmas tradition probably survived the longest. Struan dropped out of sight in the early part of this century.

"It is a shame that nobody else makes it because it is an exquisitely beautiful bread. From our research, though, it seems that Struan was not always a light and pretty loaf. The original formula, according to the old hymn, 'The Blessing of the Struan,' seems to include a number of wild and crazy ingredients such as dandelion, smooth garlic, carle-doddies and cail peach, foxglove, and marigold. There was a stiff penalty if a young lass's loaf fell during baking: one year of bad luck. That could be pretty discouraging. Some sort of flour and egg batter was periodically splashed on the loaves while they baked to give them a thick glossy outer coating. ...

NOTES : Karen Colosimo asked for a struan recipe. There is a recipe for struan in "Brother Juniper's Bread Book" by Peter Reinhart. I love it and have made it many times. (There is also a bread-machine adaptation of that same recipe in "Rustic European Breads from Your Bread Machine" by Linda West Eckhardt and Diana Collingwood Butts.) Here's my slightly adapted version - I start with all the liquid and half the flour, adding the rest gradually, rather than starting with all the flour. I make bread by hand and find it easier that way.

  450               ml  water boiling
  180                g  oat flakes or oatmeal
     1/2    tablespoon  dried yeast -- not instant 450g
                        wholemeal flour
                        -- or a mix of strong white and wholemeal
                        -- 225g rye flour
  1                tsp  salt

I thought this would be an easy one to respond to as I have many regional British cook books but an hour later I was still thumbing indexes and failing to come up with a recipe. The best I can offer you is a quote from F.Marian McNeill's 'The Scots Kitchen - Its lore and recipes'

"Struan Micheil (St Michael's Cake) In the Hebrides there is a traditional harvest cake made of a mixture of oats, barley and rye (representing the fruits of the field) baked on September 29th in honour of St Michael. As the bannock gains consistency in the firing it is covered on both sides with three successive layers of a batter of cream, eggs and butter, in the manner of the Beltane bannock Various ingredients are introduced into small struan as cranberries, blackberries, brambles, caraways and wild honey"

The batter that is referred to as covering the bannock in layers sounds rather like a glaze of butter, cream and egg which is described elsewhere in the book. A bannock would be raised with bicarbonate of soda and an acidic liquid such as buttermilk rather than yeast and is cooked on a hot griddle plate not in the oven.

The nearest recipe I could find was the following from The Food and Cooking of Russia by Lesley Chamberlain which is described as making wonderful toast due to the oats used. I'm sure you could substitute some of the rye flour for barley flour if you were trying to capture the flavours of a 'hebridean struan'.

450ml water boiling
180 g oat flakes or oatmeal
1/2 tablespoon of dried yeast, not instant 450g wholemeal flour
- or a mix of strong white and wholemeal 225g rye flour
1 tsp salt

Pour the boiling water less a few tablespoons over the oats and allow to stand for an hour. Add the yeast, dissolved in warm water, then add the flours and the salt to the oat and water mixture. Blend well and knead until you have a smooth dough. This may require a little extra wheat flour. Leave to rise until nearly double in bulk. Shape into loaves (sorry no details given about this but I would guess a couple of small loaf pans for this amount) rise again, bake at 425F for about 50 minutes gradually reducing the heat. Cool on a wire rack.

Somebody has also asked about 'strong flour'. In England flour packaged as 'strong' is basically bread flour and usually contains 10-12% protein. In Britain millers often mix Canadian flour with British flour to increase the gluten content. The type of flour called for in Irish Soda breads can vary but often includes a stone-ground wholemeal flour mixed with some white bread flour. Having watched Darina Allen of the Irish Ballymaloe cookery school making soda bread I think you have to learn to handle the dough like a fairy, her hands hardly touched the dough as she mixed it, and it was complete in a
blink. She is a wonderful lady and her book on A Year at Ballymaloe is packed with superb, simple recipes. The school's web site is

* grind in a mortar with a pestle, or in an electric spice/coffee grinder

Make dough:
In a large bowl combine water, butter, and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over mixture and let stand 5 minutes, or until foamy. Stir in eggs, salt and dry milk until combined. With a wooden spoon stir in 5 sups flour, 1 cup at a time, and stir mixture until a dough is formed.

On a floured surface, knead dough about 10 minutes, adding enough of the remaining 1 cup flour to make dough smooth and elastic. Put dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat, and let rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough and on floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll into a 15- by 20-inch rectangle. Spread butter over dough and sprinkle with granulated sugar, cinnamon and cardamom.

With a long side facing you, roll up dough jelly-roll fashion and cut crosswise into approximately 1 1/2-inch-thick slices with a cut side down. Working with 1 slice at a time gently twist opposite ends of slice around twice to form a figure eight. Crimp ends together. Arrange rolls, a swirled side up, on a buttered baking sheet about 2 inches apart and let rise in a warm place until increased 1 1/2 times in bulk, about 1 hour.

While rolls are rising, preheat oven to 350F.

Brush tops of rolls with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake rolls in middle of oven until tops are pale golden, about 25 minutes.

Makes about 15 rolls.

                        ---
  4               cups  graham cracker crumbs

Cook potatoes in large saucepan of simmering water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Place potatoes in medium bowl. Transfer reserved cooking liquid to large bowl; cool to 120F. to 130F.

Sprinkle yeast and sugar over reserved warm liquid; stir to dissolve. Let yeast mixture stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine potatoes, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup honey, oil, eggs and salt in processor. Blend until smooth. Add to yeast mixture. Mix in all purpose flour. Gradually stir in enough whole wheat flour 1/2 cup at a time to form soft, slightly sticky dough. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding more whole wheat flour if sticky.

Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl with kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400F. Grease three 9-inch-diameter cake pans. Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Divide dough into thirds. Cut each third into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into ball. Mix remaining 1 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup honey until well blended. Dip each dough ball into honey mixture and then roll in graham cracker crumbs to coat. Place 12 balls in each prepared pan, arranging close together. Let stand 10 minutes. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. (Rolls can be prepared ahead. Cool completely. Wrap tightly and refrigerate 1 day or freeze up to 1 month. Reheat rolls before serving.) Serve warm.

Makes 3 dozen.

Dissolve yeast in water. Stir in milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening and flour. Add enough remaining flour to handle easily; mix with hand. Turn onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 min.). Round up in greased bowl, greased side up. Cover with damp cloth. Let rise in warm place (85F) until double (about 1 1/2 hour). Punch down; let rise again until almost double (about 30 min). Divide dough for desired rolls. (The recipe says this dough will make 1 large coffee cake and 1 1/2 to 2 dozen rolls.) Shape, let rolls rise 15-20 minutes, and bake 12-15 minutes at 400F.

If you'd like coffee cake directions, let me know. The recipe also says that you can vary the dough recipe by using only 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp. salt and 4 1/2 to 5 cups of flour to make a richer dough.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  Warm Water -- (105 - 115 Deg F)
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  1               Tbsp  Olive Oil
     1/2           Tsp  Dried Sage -- Crushed
                        Or 2 Tsp Snipped Fresh Sage
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt
  1                Tsp  Sugar
  1 1/2           cups  Whole Wheat Flour
  2               cups  Bread Flour -- Note 1

Italian bakers call this bakery-style European country bread Pane (PAN-nay) Integrale, referring to the wheat flour used in the recipe.

Note 1: to 2-1/2 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour

In a large mixing bowl stir together the warm water, yeast, oil, fresh or dried sage, salt, and sugar. Let mixture stand for 5 minutes.

Using a wooden spoon stir in the whole wheat flour, about 1/2 cup at a time. Stir in 1-1/2 cups of the bread flour or all-purpose flour, a little at a time; stir until most of the flour has been absorbed and the dough begins to form a ball. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining bread flour or all-purpose flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape the dough into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the surface. Cover only with a damp towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (45 to 60 minutes).

Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet. Shape dough into an 8x4-inch oval loaf. Place on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with additional flour. Cover; let rise until the loaf is almost doubled in size (or 30 to 45 minutes).

Using a sharp knife slash top of loaf several times, making each cut about 1/2 inch deep. Place in a 425F. oven. For a crisp crust, spray or brush the loaves with cold water every 3 minutes for the first 9 minutes of baking. After 9 minutes, reduce oven temperature to 375F; lightly sprinkle bread with additional flour. Bake about 20 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when you tap top (if necessary, cover loosely with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking). Transfer bread to wire rack; cool completely.

Makes 1 loaf.

Tips

Test Kitchen Tips

- Before mixing the yeast and water, take the temperature of the water using a quick-read thermometer. The water needs to be 105 to 115F. to activate the yeast. If the water is too hot, the yeast will die and the bread won't rise.

- Misting or brushing the crust with water creates a hard, crisp crust once the moisture dries.

- Slashing the dough adds to the character of the loaf, but it also lets the dough expand and allows the moisture under the crust to escape. Make sure your knife is very sharp so you don't tear and deflate the loaf.

- To store, let the bread cool completely and place in an airtight container or bag. It should keep for 2 to 3 days. Don't store in the refrigerator since this will make the bread go stale more quickly. Or, you can freeze in a freezer bag or container for up to 3 months.

- Serve this bread in the traditional Italian way-dip bite-size pieces in olive oil and sprinkle with cracked black pepper. Serve with some Parmesan cheese on the side.

                 *****

"... If you decide to try baking with a cloche, spray the dome thoroughly with water before putting it in the oven. The round dome calls for a round loaf and the final rise is done right on the clay plate. Be sure that there is ample polenta under the loaf to prevent the dough from sticking. Because the dome keeps heat out as well as in, turn the oven up to 450 degrees F. (425 degrees F. in a convection oven). When the dough is three-quarters proofed, spray it, spray the dome, slash the top of the loaf and put it in the oven. After five minutes, turn down the heat to 425 degrees F. (375 degrees F. in a convection oven). The loaf will take longer than uncovered loaves to bake, probably close to an hour. When it appears done, remove the dome, turn off the heat, and give the bread a ten-minute cool down in the oven. Allow forty-five additional minutes for the loaf to cool down outside the oven before tearing into it. ..."

And Mr. Stone, you might want to check The Complete Book of Breads by Bernard Clayton, Jr. for your rye bread recipe. My 1973 volume has a recipe for Russian Black Bread on pages 194-197, but I'm sure the newer version of the book must have a similar recipe.

First make yeast dough with all the first ingrediants. Then add the next ingredients, keeping 2 tablespoons back for topping.

Let dough stand at a warm or room temperature about 40-50 min. until the dough is double.

Form bread, put it on a oily cookie sheat, brush top with water, put Sesame, Leinsamen and Weizenschrot on top. Cover the bread and let it stand warm again for another 15 min. (I would probably let it stand until doubled again)

Meanwhile preheat oven to 200C (392F ... I bake all my bread at 350F, so I probably wouldn't put it this high). Put a little bowl with water in the bottom of the oven. Bake bread on the first level of the oven about 50 - 60 min. (I usually find 40 minutes to be enough for any loaf of bread)

NOTES : I received the following recipe from a German woman in response to my request for German grain breads. I haven't tried it yet. I put weight and liquid conversions in parans and also some notes about how I personally bake bread with success. Her time and temp seem quite high.

When I questioned the high temps advised (I've found 350F to be the ideal temp for my bread) my friend said: "Don't worry! The first ten min. are necessary for the crust I think. 200C is quite normal. If you have an oven which "Umluft" circulating air you bake it 30 - 40C lower. You need also the higher temperature for the color and crust and because the dough is heavy (starch gets brown and there is no sugar in it). Pale bread doesn't look and taste good. Nobody would buy a pale, soft and doughy bread here. If you think your bread will get to dark cover it with alufoil the last 10 or 15 min. Every oven works different. But remember you need a thicker crust."

 I've left her original instructions and added my adjustments in parens. I meant to measure as I weighed and add cup measurements too, but forgot to do some of them. You can't assume that 1 oz. of one ingredient will equal 1 oz. of another in volume, due to density. For example, 1.8 oz. of sesame seed was 5 T., but 1.8 oz. of flax seed was 3.5 T.

First make yeast dough with all the first ingrediants. Then add the next ingredients, keeping 2 tablespoons back for topping.

Let dough stand at a warm or room temperature about 40-50 min. until the dough is double.

                            Za'atar Flatbread

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads: Quick & Muffins         Daily Bread Mailing List
                International Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Za'atar -- Lemon And Oil
                        Topping
     1/4           cup  za'atar spice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        juice of two lemons -- about 1/2 cup juice
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Bread
  1         tablespoon  quick-rising or instant yeast
  2               cups  lukewarm water (l00F to 110F)
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  5               cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  1 3/4      teaspoons  kosher salt

Topping: Stir together all the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Bread: Whisk together the yeast, water, and sugar. Stir in the oil, the all-purpose flour and most of the bread flour, then the salt. Mix to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, till it's elastic and supple, adding additional flour as needed.

Place the dough in a large, well-greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a tea towel, and let rise until doubled. Alternatively, allow the dough a long, cool rise in the fridge, several hours or overnight (or up to 3 days). Bring the dough to room temperature before shaping; it'll rise as it warms up.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Stretch or roll the pieces into irregular slabs, and let rest for 15 minutes, covered with a tea towel. Spread some olive oil/za'atar mixture onto each piece of dough.

Preheat the grill to its hottest temperature. Place the flatbreads gently on the grill. Cover and bake for 1 to 2 minutes, then check for doneness. Allow to bake until the tops begin to brown. Brush with additional topping if desired, and remove from the grill. Yield: 8 large, irregular-shaped flatbreads

NOTES : This is just about my favorite flatbread, good alone, with a generous smear of hummus or Lebanese yogurt, or simply topped with fresh tomatoes, salt, pepper, and olive oil. You can make your own za'atar spice, or look for it in Middle Eastern markets, if you live in an urban area that features a good selection of ethnic food stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough
  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
  1         tablespoon  non-fat dry milk powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  + 2 tablespoons water
                        Filling
                        one 2-ounce can flat anchovy filets -- anchovies
                        rinsed
                        and separated*
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  pine nuts, (optional)

*You should have 16 anchovy pieces. If not, divide one or more of the bigger pieces in half.

Manual Method: In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the dough ingredients, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough, by hand (10 minutes) or by machine (5 minutes) till it's smooth. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. About 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle, check the dough and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water; the finished dough should be soft and supple, but not sticky.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and divide it into 16 pieces, about 1 3/8 ounces (40g) each. Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough into a rough 4 x 2-inch rectangle. Lay an anchovy piece lengthwise over the dough, and space 5 to 6 raisins and a sprinkle of pine nuts along the anchovy. Fold the short edges of the dough over the ends of the anchovy, then pinch the long edges together to completely enclose the filling. Roll the dough to make a smooth log about 4 1/2 inches long. It's important to seal the log as well as possible, otherwise the zeppole will split open during frying. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and filling.

While you're working with the dough, heat vegetable oil (or your preferred frying oil) in a deep fryer, a wide saucepan, or in an electric frying pan to a temperature of 385F to 390F. (The zeppole can be fried in oil as shallow as 1/2 inch, but 3/4 to 1 inch is easier.)

Transfer the zeppole, one by one, to the hot oil. Don't crowd them; using a 12-inch skillet, we were able to fry five at a time without the temperature of the oil fluctuating too wildly. Fry the zeppole for about 5 minutes, turning once; they should be a medium-golden brown. Transfer the zeppole to paper towels or to a flattened brown paper bag to drain. Serve zeppole warm or at room temperature. Yield: 16 zeppole

NOTES : Here's a dish that appears in just about every Sons of Italy community cookbook you run across -- and no two recipes are alike. Zeppole -- basically, fried dough -- can be made sweet, savory or both; served hot, warm, or at room temperature, at any time of the day; and can come from a dough that is as runny as pancake batter or as stiff as firm bread dough. Just as every American has his or her own special doughnut, apple pie, or chocolate chip cookie recipe, so does every Italian have his or her own zeppole formula

  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  vegetable shortening
  2                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  lemon extract or 1/4 teaspoon lemon oil
  1                cup  shredded zucchini (about 5 ounces -- half of a
                        medium-sized zucchini)
  2 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1                cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  chopped nuts

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening, then beat in the eggs. Mix in the vanilla, lemon and zucchini.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, ginger and nutmeg. Combine the dry ingredients thoroughly with the wet ingredients, then stir in the raisins and nuts (walnuts, pecans or almonds are all good choices).

Drop the dough by teaspoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet, and bake the cookies for 15 minutes in a preheated 375F oven. Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool them on a wire rack. Yield: about 40 cookies

I must admit, I was fully prepared to dislike these cookies. What, no chocolate? And all that baking powder! They're sure to be those kind of icky, spongy, dry cookies that are always the last ones to go at the potluck supper.

Well, I was wrong. These cookies are indeed light textured, and they're soft, but they're not spongy, dry or, least of all, icky. A very light cream-yellow, they're fine-textured and have a refreshing, lemony taste. -- P.J.H.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        grated peel of 1/2 lemon
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts -- (or more)
     1/2           cup  raisins -- (or more)
  2                     eggs -- beaten

     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  shredded zucchini -- (packed)

First: Preheat your oven to 400F.

Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and lemon peel in a large bowl. Stir in the walnuts and raisins.

In a smaller bowl (or a two cup liquid measure), combine the eggs, milk and oil.

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir just until barely combined and then gently fold in the zucchini.

Spoon the batter into a greased, 12-cup muffin tin. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the muffins spring back when you press them with your fingertips.

NOTES : A Tip from King Arthur Flour...Don't beat those muffins! The baking soda and baking powder used to leaven muffins is activated by moisture (baking soda) and moisture/heat (double-acting baking powder). Once this reaction starts, there's no putting it on hold. You can stir your dry ingredients vigorously, and beat your wet ingredients to a froth, but when you put the two together, do it gently -- you don't want to disturb those little air bubbles responsible for making your muffins.

                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1                cup  plus 2 tablespoons lukewarm milk
     1/4           cup  butter -- (4 tablespoons)
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  4               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (4 to 4
     1/2                )

Stir together 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, the yeast and 2 tablespoons lukewarm milk in a small bowl; let the mixture foam and bubble.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining milk and sugar and the butter, just until the butter melts. Let the mixture cool to 100 to 105F, or until barely warm.

Combine the milk mixture and the yeast mixture in a large bowl. Stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt, and beat in the egg. Mix in the unbleached flour, 1/2 cup at a time. When the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead in the remaining flour to form a smooth, elastic dough, just slightly on the slack side; this should take 5 to 10 minutes. Note: This dough is also easily prepared using your bread machine's dough cycle, or with the aid of an electric mixer (knead with the dough hook for about 5 minutes).

Lightly grease a large bowl, place the dough inside, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise until it's doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch the dough down, knead it briefly on a lightly floured work surface to remove large air bubbles, and divide it in half. Roll the pieces with your hands to form two 12-inch long cylindrical loaves. If the dough resists rolling, let it rest, covered, for several minutes; when you return, you should find the gluten relaxed and the task much easier.

Place the loaves on a well-greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between them. Cover the loaves with plastic wrap and let them rise until they've almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven until it's golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the loaves reads 190F. Cool overnight, uncovered, on a wire rack.

The next day, preheat the oven to 200F. With a serrated knife, cut the loaves diagonally into slices about 1/2-inch thick. Place the slices, close together, on ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheets and bake them until they're completely dry, about 1 hour.

Increase the oven temperature to 300F and bake the slices until they're lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes, turning them halfway through the baking time to check their progress and prevent over-browning. Cool on wire racks. When thoroughly cooled, these will keep for many weeks in an airtight container. Yield: about 48 pieces

Note: For a sweeter zwieback, we melted 4 tablespoons of butter with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and brushed the mixture onto one side of the cut slices before baking them, which took 10 to 15 minutes longer because of the extra moisture. This version was P.J.'s favorite.

Nutrition information per serving (1 plain zwieback, 21g): 56 cal, 1.3g fat, 2g protein, 8g complex carbohydrates, 1g sugar, 9mg cholesterol, 27mg sodium, 27mg potassium, 14RE vitamin A, 1mg iron, 27mg calcium, 19mg phosphorus.

Comfort food. Are you thinking chicken-noodle soup? Maybe the creamiest macaroni and cheese? The silkiest chocolate pudding ever, perhaps? Well, how about zwieback? You know, those ultra-dry, lightly spiced, faintly sweet and invariably satisfying toasts your kids (or you yourself) may have gnawed on as teething biscuits.

Zwieback aren't just for toddlers, though; they're also a wonderful companion to tea or coffee, to dip or not as you please. At first glance this recipe, with a bearing point from one in Helen Witty and Elizabeth Schneider Colchie's Better Than Store-Bought, may look too plain to be able to produce the desired outcome successfully, but even before these rusks were out of the oven, we had to acknowledge their already distinctive zwieback smell. When they'd cooled, let's just say we had a LOT of happy munchers around here who felt they were experiencing once again the unforgettably classic taste they all remembered.

As part of the testing process, we even sent a bag of zwieback home with Steve Voigt, our chief numbers guy, for his 18-month-old son George to sample. The next day Steve admitted that even though he'd consumed all but one before sharing them, George seemed to be enjoying that sole survivor as Steve left for work in the morning. With such universal appeal, we say go full circle the next time you have an urge to nibble, and take comfort in the crunch of this quintessential childhood food.
