FOR CRUST:  Stir egg yolks and Calvados in a small bowl to blend.  Combine

out.)

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 14" round.  Transfer to 11"
diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold overhand in and press, forming
double-thick sides.  Chill while making filling.

FOR FILLING:  Combine almonds, 3/4 cup sugar, eggs, 1 Tablespoon Calvados,
extracts and salt in processor.  Blend until soft paste forms.  Add 4 T
butter, blend 10 seconds.  Spread in crust.  Chill until firm, about 45
minutes.  

Meanwhile, stir apples, 1 Tablespoon Calvados and 1 Tablespoon sugar in large
bowl.  Let stand 30 minutes.  

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Drain apples; overlap in concentric circles
atop filling.  Melt 2 Tablespoons butter; brush over apples.  Sprinkle with 1
Tablespoon sugar.  

Bake tart 15 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 350 degrees.  Bake until apples
are tender, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to rack.  Stir preserves and 1
Tablespoon Calvados in small saucepan over low heat until preserves melt.

   1      Lb            Beets
   1      Lb            Carrots -- Sliced
   2      Tbsp          Fresh Ginger Root -- Grated
     1/2  C             Brown Sugar
     1/2  C             Orange Juice

     1/2  Tsp           Cinnamon
     1/2  Tsp           Mace

  Wash the beets well and cut off the leaves, leaving an inch or so of stem.
  Cover with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer, covered until tender,
  about 40 minutes. Drain and cover with cool or lukewarm water. When cool
  enough to handle, slip off the skins. Cut the beets into slices or chunks.
   Peel and cut the carrots into slices or chunks, resemling the beets in size
  and  style.  Steam or boil in lightly salted water about 5 minutes or until
  tender but not soft. Drain.
   Combine the ginger, sugar, orange juice, vinegar, orange zest and spices in
  a saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook until thickened. Simmer
  the cooked beets and carrots in this sauce for about 5 minutes.
   Note:  Alternatively, you may bake the beets in a foil-covered pan for
  about an  hour.  When cool, slip off the skins.  Cut the beets into slices or chunks.
    Since I didn't want to waste the beet tops, I sliced the green beet tops
  and steamed them and when I combined the sauce with the cooked beets and
  carrots, I  also added the steamed beet tops.

            Cabbage With Honey, Apple And Parsnip - Beekeepers

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 6    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetable Accompaniments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    Red Cabbage (1-1/2 To 2 Lbs)
   1                    Onion
   1                    Parsnip
   1                    Apple
   1      Tbsp          Honey
     1/2  Oz            Butter
   2      Tbsp          Fruit Vinegar (Or More)
                        -- preferably raspberry
                        Caraway seeds
     1/4  Pt            Yoghurt Or Sour Cream, Opt.

  Cut cabbage into quarters.  Remove and discard the tough central stalk.
  Shred the cabbage and put it into a large mixing bowl.  Peel and finely
  chop the onion and add it to the cabbage.  Cut the parsnip and apple into
  small pieces, peeling them first if you wish, and add them to the bowl.
  Drizzle on the honey.  Add a good seasoning of salt and pepper and scant
  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  Sprinkle on the vinegar , use 3 tablespoons if
  the apple you are using is the dessert variety, just 2 tablespoons if it is
  a cooking apple.  Mix everything together well using your hands -- a little
  messy, but spoons are not as effective -- then pile the mixture into a
  buttered casserole.  Lay a sheet of thickly buttered greaseproof paper
  directly on top of the vegetables and cover the casserole with a well
  fitting lid to prevent drying out.
  
      Cook at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for about 2-1/2 hours until the
  vegetables are beautifully tender, if possible stir the mixture once or
  twice as it cooks.  Remove the greaseproof paper and check seasoning
  immediately before serving.  Serve the vegetable mixture just as it is, or
  top at the last minute with 1/4 pint cold creamy yoghurt or soured cream
  into which you have stirred a few bruised and lightly crushed caraway
  seeds.  Or hand round the bowl of flavoured cream separately, so that those
  who want it can help themselves.

Recipe By     : pg
Serving Size  : 4    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      Pound         carrots -- peeled and sliced
     1/2  Teaspoon      whole dry rosemary leaves
   1      Small         onion -- diced fine
   2      Tablespoons   butter
   1      Teaspoon      fresh lemon juice
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

1.  Boil small amount of water (about 1 1/2 cups) with rosemary in it
(e.g., infuse rosemary).  Let stand a couple of minutes.  Strain & throw
away rosemary.

2.  Put carrots (& salt to taste, if desired) in rosemary-seasoned water &
cook until tender (poke w. fork).

3.  Meanwhile, saute onions in butter until tender.  Add drained carrots,
lemon juice, salt & pepper.  Serve.

(Note:  slice carrots to thickness of your preference - we do about 1/4 "
inch - time it takes to cook carrots depends on thickness, 1/4-inch cooks
quite quickly)
Very nice when mushed with wizzer and a dash of Balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice

  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark Chicken Da Vinci Saute Italian
  Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
  sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and green
  peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook until veggies
  are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not browned. Remove from pan
  and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute mushrooms until browned, remove
  and add to rest of the stuff. Last step, saute the chicken until done. Add
  everything else back into the pan, season generously with rosemary and
  oregano. Throwing a little basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems

   1 5/8  Lb            Mushrooms
   1      Pinch         Paprika

  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a heavy
  skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
  translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
  Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium
  heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively,
  liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a
  piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60
  seconds. Overcooking causes the liver to be dry and tough. For finely
  mashed egg that disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a wire
  strainer. For best results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and
  sieve them separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
  place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
  the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat
  and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper. Taste and
  adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial gravy browning
  liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. 

Serve sprinkled with reserved egg yolk sieved on top
  with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread. Serves 4. By Sur Le

in a roomy pan; for each quart of water add 3 tablespoons of wine
vinegar.  Steam the fish fillets for 9-10 minutes.  Discard broth.

Boil spinach in a large kettle of slightly salted water for 2-3
minutes.  Drain, run cold water over the spinach and squeeze dry.
Chop with a stainless steel knife.  Simmer 3-4 minutes with butter
in a covered stainless pot.  Season carefully to taste.

To assemble, stir 2/3 cup of sauce into the spinach; spread in a
buttered baking dish.  Arrange fish on spinach.  Spoon remaining sauce
over fish; sprinkle on remaining cheese. Bake 1 hour before serving in
the upper third of a preheated oven just until bubbling hot and the
sauce is lightly brown on top.

Compliment the fillets with a salad of green lettuce, mandarin oranges
and slices of red onion, wild rice, french bread and a slice of honey
dew melon.

Serves 6.

  simmer for 6 minutes.  Add the fish and cook just

cilantro, chives, jalapeÏo, and yogurt.

TOMATILLOS resemble small green tomatoes with a papery husk. Tark lemony
flavor, used in salsas. Available canned or fresh. If you need a small
amount, substitute a salsa verde that is mostly tomatillos.


Notes: Here is a lower fat alternative to the classic dish. Since it has
such a lovely color, I suggest serving it in a Mexican terra cotta bowl
surrounded by blue corn tortilla chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/4  Pounds        lean ground beef
     1/3  Cup           Onion -- Chopped
     3/4  Teaspoon      Garlic -- Chopped
   4      Teaspoons     salt
     3/8  Teaspoon      red pepper -- crushed
   1      Tablespoon    oregano
   3      Tablespoons   Parsley -- Chopped
  18      Ounces        tomato paste -- 3 (6-oz) cans
  24      Ounces        tomato sauce -- 3 (8-oz) cans
   2 1/4  Cups          hot water
   3      Large         eggs -- beaten
   3      Pounds        ricotta cheese
   1      Pound         lasagna noodles -- cooked, (18 noodles)
  12      Ounces        mozzarella cheese -- shredded
     3/4  Cup           Parmesan cheese

Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top.  Use one pan for each six servings or one-fourth of the recipe.  Do not line pans for food to be served without freezing.

Crumble beef; cook until lightly browned.  Stir in onion.  Cook until onion is tender.  Drain off fat.  Stir in seasonings, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.  Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  In another bowl, blend eggs with ricotta cheese.

 In each pan, spread a layer of meat mixture (about 3/4 cup).  Add a layer each of noodles (2 1/4), meat mixture (about 3/4 cup), ricotta cheese mixture (about 3/4 cup), mozzarella cheese (1/3 cup), and parmesan cheese (1 1/2 tablespoons).  Repeat layers until all ingredients are used.  Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400=B0 F. (hot).  Bake 30 minutes or until sauce bubbles at edges.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food.  Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of food.  Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape.  Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze for 10-12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN LASAGNA:  Preheat oven to 400=B0 F. (hot).  Remove freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 1/4 hours or until sauce bubbles at edges and center is hot.

   6                    French bread
   2       Tb           Parmesan cheese
   1       C            Gruyere cheese, grated
     1/2  Cup           noilly prat, dry white wine or vermouth
   1      Tablespoon    worcestershire sauce
   3      Sprigs        parsley
     1/2  Teaspoon      paprika

  Peel onions; cut off and discard root ends.  Using a large French chef's
  knife, slice onions thinly (about 5 cups). Put butter in a 4 qt. saucepan
  and heat over moderately high heat until butter melts. Add onions and
  ground pepper to butter.  Saute' onion mixture, stirring frequently with a
  wooden spoon, until onions are a light golden brown. Sprinkle onions with
  flour and stir until all traces of flour disappear. Cook 1 minute longer,
  stirring constantly with wooden spoon. Remove from heat.
  
  Gradually add beef broth, stirring onion mixture constantly; stir in water
  and bay leaf.  Return to moderately high heat and bring mixture to a boil,
  stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to low and cook onion soup, uncovered,
  for 30 to 40 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.
  
  Salt and pepper to taste.  Turn soup into a broilerproof soup tureen,
  casserole or individual onion-soup bowls on a jelly-roll pan. Toast the
  French bread slices in a toaster or under the broiler until they are a
  light golden brown.  Arrange toast slices on top of onion soup (do not push
  them down under the soup.) Sprinkle the toast liberally with the Parmesan
  and grated Gruyere cheese.  Place broiler proof tureen or bowls 6 inches
  under a preheated broiler or place in an oven preheated to 425 degrees.
  Broil or bak the soup until cheese melts and turns golden. Remove from oven
  and serve immediately.
  
  For smaller families, prepare soup ahead and serve later.

                        Meringue
   2      Large         egg whites
     1/8  Teaspoon      cream of tartar
     1/4  Cup           superfine sugar -- (see notes)
     1/8  Teaspoon      almond extract
					
                        Frozen yogurt
  24      Ounces        raspberries
   2      Tablespoons   cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/4  Cup           raspberry juice (slurry)
     1/4  Cup           sugar
     1/4  Cup           light corn syrup
     1/2  Teaspoon      vanilla

   1      Cup           yogurt cheese -- (see recipe)
     3/4  Cup           1% fat soy milk
					
                        Sauce
   2      Cups          frozen mixed berries -- (blueberries,
                        raspberries, strawberries, blackberries)
   2      Tablespoons   sugar
     1/2  Teaspoon      arrowroot mixed with
   1      Teaspoon      water (slurry)
					
                        Garnish
   4                    fresh mint sprigs or edible flowers

1. Preheat the oven to 225°F (95°C).

FOR THE MERINGUE:
2. Beat the egg whites until foamy; add the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Sprinkle the sugar in gradually while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in the almond extract last.

3. Spoon the meringue into a pastry bag with a medium-size (Ateco #3) tip. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

Create small cups in this manner:
Pipe meringue in a coil, starting out in the middle and moving out in concentric circles to form the bottom. Three circles piped one atop the other around the outside edge will form the sides.

You should have enough meringue to make six 3-inch cups. Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours or until dry but not brown. Store in an airtight container until you are ready to use.

FOR THE FROZEN YOGURT:
4. Thaw the raspberries and press through a sieve. You should get 1 1/2 cups of raspberry juice. Reserve 1/4 cup of the juice for the slurry and pour the rest into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1 cup, which will take about 10 minutes.  (The amounts given in this step will need to be adjusted if the recipe has been scaled).

5. Remove from the heat to add the slurry, then return to the heat to cook the cornstarch until clear, for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in the sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and lemon juice. Set in the refrigerator to chill.

6. Stir the yogurt and soy milk together with a wire whisk until there are no lumps. Add the chilled raspberry syrup and stir until well mixed. Pour into your ice cream freezer and follow the manufacturer's directions. This will take about 20 minutes in most electric machines. Let ripen for an hour in the freezer.

TO MAKE THE SAUCE:
7. Thaw the mixed berries and press through a sieve into a small saucepan. Add the sugar and slurry. Heat, stirring often to dissolve the sugar and thicken the sauce.

TO SERVE: Set a meringue cup filled with raspberry frozen yogurt onto each of 6 dessert plates. Spoon the sauce around each meringue and garnish with a sprig of fresh mint or an edible flower such as a pansy.

                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOTES : I make my own superfine sugar by simply whizzing granulated sugar in my blender until it's a powdery consistency. Don't substitute confectioner's sugar, because it contains cornstarch, which would toughen the meringue.

Floyd Says
Cut into fork size pieces and......important to cook each vegetable seperately.
1. Sprinkle aubergine and courgette with salt, sweat and dry
2. In large frypan cook each vegetable in olive oil one after another until tender, put aside with juices from pan.
3. Put all in saucepan, add herbs and seasonings and left over oil and cook 10-15 mins to mix.
4. Leave to cool - refrigerate? eat warm or cold

Alternative Prep
 Combine eggplant slices, zucchini slices, and green pepper slices in a large oven-safe bowl. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of salt and pour a quart of boiling water over the vegetables. Let stand 10 minutes, drain and pat dry.
     In a large skillet, cook the onions and garlic cloves in olive oil until softened. Spread onion mixture on the bottom of an oiled shallow 2 quart baking dish. Arrange half the vegetable mixture on top of the onion mixture and spread it with half the tomato slices. Sprinkle the tomatoes with 2 tablespoons Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon basil, and salt and pepper to taste.
     Arrange the remaining vegetables and tomatoes in layers in the baking dish and season them with 1/2 teaspoon basil and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and bread crumbs and drizzle with olive oil. Bake at 400° for 45 minutes.

   1      Med           Onion -- Thinly Sliced

 In Spain, a tortilla is a peasant potato omlette. It is usually eaten at room temperature, and is standard picnic food. It's cooked in a medium  sized sautee (or frying) pan and is round and solid; serve it sliced in pie-shaped pieces.

Heat oil in pan, lower heat and sautee potatoes a handful at a time and onions slowly until fairly soft. Turn and "slice" at them often with spoon or metal spatula. Scrape pan so nothing sticks Sprinkle with salt After 20 mins or so Lift cooked potatoes into bowl.
Reserve oil and mix potatoes with slightly beaten eggs mix lightly.
Wipe out pan and add 2 tbs of reserved oik - really hot tip in ladle full of mixture, reduce heat and Cook slowly until bubbles start to appear on top, or it seems half-cooked.
Loosen from pan with spatula if necessary. Place a plate on top, turn tortilla over on to pan, then slide it off into pan to cook on other side for 4-5 mins. Should be solid when finished.
 Remove from pan the same way. (Experts flip the tortilla to turn it - I have never had the nerve to even TRY this!). Makes a good side dish, light supper, or picnic dish.

                      Tandoori Chicken Aka Tanducki

Recipe By     : etal
Serving Size  : 6    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Indian                           Poultry
                Chili, Hot Or Spicy              Main Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   6      Pcs           chicken, skinned
   2      Tsp           Ground Coriander
   1      Jar           Tandoori Paste
          Dash          Chili Powder
   1      Dash          garlic powder
     1/2  Tsp           Sea Salt
   1      Tsp           Ground jeera
                        Soy sauce (or yogurt)
   1                    Lemon
   2                    Lemons -- For Garnish

1. Take the skin off chicken and make *deep* cuts in it (so that the masalas seep in quickly). 
2. If you are using soy sauce as the base, put some on the chicken pieces and let it seep in the cuts or rub in lemon juice and leave 1/2 hour. 
3. Rub in the masalas as a mixture or one at a time. The idea is to let the masalas seep in the cuts with the soy sauce. You can leave it for little while to seep in. Leave in fridge for 12 hours
4. If you are using yogurt, you'll get a more authentic taste since the original TC is after all marinated in it. In this case, mix the masalas in the yogurt first and then rub the stuff into the chicken cuts as before. The yogurt tends to leave considerable amount of water behind. DON'T THROW THIS AWAY. Let it evaporate in the oven with the chicken. This will keep the pieces from getting dry if over-cooked. I have not faced the same problem with the soy sauce version (of dry chicken). 
5. Cook the chicken till it starts turning brown.
and the cuts you made start "expanding".

Recipe By     : Jo Anne Merrill
Serving Size  : 10   Preparation Time :0:45

   2 1/2                lemon -- juice and peel
   1 1/4  C             apple juice

* Use whole grain bread to make the crumbs. Substitute 1-2 tablespoons wheat germ for equal amount of crumbs if preferred.

     1. Prepare apples: peel, core and slice thinly to equal 4 cups. Use Granny Smith or other tart apples.
     2. Grate the rind of 1/2 of the lemon, being careful not to include any of the pith just below the peel. Juice half the lemon, or all if it is a small lemon.
     3. Mix bread crumbs with melted margarine and blend.
     4. Mix sugar with nutmeg, lemon peel and juice; blend.
     5. Grease a casserole dish with margarine. Put a layer of crumbs on bottom, spread half the apples atop then half the sugar mixture. Put the rest of the apples, then the sugar and top with remaining crumbs. Add 1/2 cup very hot apple juice or water. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 40 minutes or until done. Cover loosely with foil tent for first 20 minutes to prevent crumbs browning too quickly.

   6       lg           Oranges (navel)
   1       t            Honey
     1/2   ts           Cinnamon
   1       lb           Mixed fresh greens (half

                        Works best)
     1/2   c            Thin sliced purple onion
   1       c            Thin sliced radishes
   1       c            Toasted walnut halves chop

   3       tb           Quality olive oil
                        Salt and pepper to taste

  At least 1 1/2 hours before serving, peel and section the oranges. With a
  serrated knife or citrus knife, remove the membrane lining from each orange
  segment. Place oranges in a bowl and squeeze all excess juice from the
  remaining lining over the oranges. Discard any membrane and pick out seeds,
  if necessary. Drizzle honey and sprinkle cinnamon over oranges, cover and
  let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Clean greens and pat
  dry. Break into bite size pieces and toss well with onions, radishes and
  nuts in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over salad and toss to distribute.
  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Just before serving,
  add the oranges and all their liquid. Mix well.

                           Yoghurt Brule Simple

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Fruit
   2      Tablespoons   yogurt
   1      Tablespoon    soft brown sugar
                        ***CHOICES***
                        grapes
                        sliced bananas
                        berries
                        pineapple pieces
                        sliced pears
                        sliced peaches

Put just enough fruit into a small ramekin to come half-way up the pot. If
using grapes, halve and seed them. Cut any other fruit into small slices.
Cover the fruit with the yogurt and sprinkle the sugar on top.

Place the pots under a very hot broiler (grill) until the sugar begins to
bubble. Refrigerate until required.

This is a good last minute dessert for unexpected guests. If you are short
of time put the pots into the freezer for 10 minutes after cooking.
