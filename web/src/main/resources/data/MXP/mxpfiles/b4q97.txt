                Hand Made                       Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2          cup.  water
  2               cup.  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  nonfat milk solids
                        -- (dry milk to you probably)
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoon.  yeast
  1         tablespoon  melted butter
  1           teaspoon  dill weed
  4             medium  carrots -- peeled (4 to 5)

Preparing the carrots:
	Peel and wash the carrots. Coarsely grate 2 1/2 (about 2/3c.) and set aside. Chop 1/2 into thin slices. Add 1/2 to the water in a blender and puree. Eat 1 for inspiration.

Mixing:
	Add the yeast to the water and stir. Mix together the other dry ingredients, including the remaining carrots, holding back a cup of flour. Add the liquid and stir well, adding flour as needed until kneadable, and then knead until smooth and soft with the help of further flour. If you chopped the carrots too coarsely, they may begin popping out as you knead and have to be removed. This is hardly a tragedy, though, as you will find that even the dough is delicious.

Rising:
	Place dough in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover, and set aside to rise for about an hour. When doubled, punch down and place in a loaf pan (This recipe won't fill many pans, but it can be scaled up to 1.5# simply by multiplying all ingredients by 1.5. You may have to go easy on the carrots), with buttered or oiled sides and oatmeal-dusted bottom (this is my own invention. It seems to prevent sticking like nothing else I've ever tried, and unlike the icky flour that adheres to the bottom of some things, the oats are baked crisp and find the lower bound of their taste at neutral.), and again cover to rise until doubled. Bake in a 350F-degree oven for about 50 minutes, possibly longer if you like your bread dry rather than moist. Allow to cool ~10 min.

Amusement while baking:
	Tell people you're making carrot bread and explode when they reveal they're expecting a pound cake. Tell them the bread has "weed" in it and watch them get a psychosomatic marijuana high. Or don't say anything at all, and when you slice into the loaf shout, "Damn phytoplankton got into the flour again."

Counterindications:
	If you eat more than one or two loaves, you may have to reassure your doctor that you don't have hepatitis. On the bright side, carotinemia is completely unrelated to anemic iron deficiency, and is in fact completely benign. Discontinue use if you die -- you've had your chance.

                               Bulgur Bread

Recipe By     :Alford and Duguid
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads                          Fatfree
                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           Cups  Bulgur -- Fine Or Medium
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  2               Cups  boiling water
     1/2           Cup  minced onion
  2               Cups  All-Purpose Flour
                        -- Or Unbleached Hard White

You will need a medium-sized bowl, a food processor (optional), unglazed quarry tiles to fit on the bottom rack of your oven, and a rolling pin.

Place the bulgur and salt in a food processor, pour the boiling water over, and stir or process briefly to mix. Let stand for thirty minutes. When you come back to the bulgur mixture, it will look like the bulgur has totally absorbed the water. However, proceed by adding 1 cup flour and the minced onion, and process for 1 minute. The dough should come together into a large ball as you process. If it doesn't, feel the dough: If it feels dry and floury, start the processor, add 2 tablespoons warm water and process for 30 seconds; again if the bulgur and flour still don't come together, add another 2 tablespoons water and process.

Once a ball of dough forms, process for 2 to 3 minutes longer, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. (If your processor is too small to handle the whole dough, work with half at a time, adding 1/2 cup flour to each portion, then combine when you turn out of the processor and knead by hand). Knead by hand for 4 to 5 minutes.

Alternatively, if you do not have a food processor, combine bulgur, salt and boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let stand for 30 minutes. Add onions and 1/2 cup flour and stir in. Add another 1/2 cup flour and use your hands to fold flour into the dough. With a little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat sticky) that you can knead. Turn out onto a well-floured kneading surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes. Dough will be sticky at first, but will soon come together into a smooth workable dough; you may be surprised to discover how kneadable bulgur is.

When finished kneading, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand until you are ready to proceed further, for 15 minutes to an hour, whatever is convenient.

To bake, have your oven preheated to 450F with baking stone or quarry tiles in place on a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, and flatten each on a well-floured bread board. With a rolling pin, roll out one or two breads until very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Work with only one or two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven. When ready, handle the bread gently as you place it on the hot tiles. (You can also try dusting a peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour and using peel or sheet to transfer breads to hot tiles.) Bake on one side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The bread should begin to brown around the outside. When baked, keep breads warm by stacking them one on top of the other and wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel. Serve warm.

Yield: 8 thin, supple and slightly chewy flatbreads between 8 and 10 inches in diameter.

NOTES : The dough for this cracker-like unyeasted flatbread is easily mixed in the food processor. The breads have a wonderful aroma as they bake and a satisfying savory taste, for the dough is made of full-grain bulgur, with only a little flour, and flavored with minced onion. The breads bake quickly in the oven. Bulgur breads go wonderfully with cheese, or strong flavors. Leave them to dry out and use as crackers, or wrap in a cloth to keep chewy and supple.

     1/2           cup  milk
                        -- (I used powdered milk + water)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  3               cups  bread flour -- *
     1/4           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  shortening
                        -- (I used vegetable oil)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        Filling:
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
  2               cups  chopped cabbage
                        salt and pepper to taste

* (I had to add quite a bit more to make the dough the right consistency; you can do this during the kneading if the dough looks too moist and sticky; the consistency should be the same as for regular bread dough)

Put the ingredients in the bread maker in the usual order. Run the 'dough' setting.

Brown the ground beef together with the onion and cabbage in a frying pan, adding salt and pepper to taste.

When the dough cycle is complete, divide the dough into two balls. Roll out the first ball into a large sheet. Cut in squares. Fill each one with the beef mixture. Either fold the dough over and seal, or cover with another square (if the squares turn out small and thin) and pinch the edges shut tight. Arrange on a baking sheet. Repeat with the second ball of dough. Let rise 15 minutes. Brush the top of each with beaten egg or egg yolk. Bake in a 375 F degree oven until golden brown. Do not overbake.

                                Chapati #2

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads     Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Cups  Whole Wheat Flour -- Atta Flour, Sifted
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  1                Cup  Warm Water -- Approx

Making chapatis can be a very relaxing thing to do. In quite a short time you can produce eight or ten breads, each one turning out a little bit different from the others, but all of them attractive, nutritious, and good. We've grown so accustomed to making chapatis that they now feel almost like a convenience food, a household staple of the best kind.

You will need a medium-sized bowl, a rolling pin, a cast iron griddle or heavy skillet, and a small cotton cloth or a paper towel.

In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the salt and the flour. Make a well in the middle and add just less than 1 cup warm water. Mix with your hand or with a spoon until you can gather it together into a dough (depending on the condition of your flour, you may need a little extra water or a little extra flour to make a kneadable dough). Turn out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth or a plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours. The longer the dough stands, the more digestible the breads.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces and flatten each with lightly floured fingers. Continue flattening with a rolling pin until each piece is 8 inches in diameter. Once you have started rolling, roll out each bread without flipping it over. To keep the bread from sticking to your bread board, make sure that the bread is lightly floured underneath. Cover the breads with the damp towel or plastic wrap as you roll out others (make sure not to stack the rolled out breads; if you don't have enough counter space for the breads, roll out just a few and begin cooking, rolling out the others as the breads cook).

Heat a cast iron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. When the griddle is hot, place a chapati on the griddle, top side of the bread down first. Let cook for only 10 seconds and then gently flip to the second side. Cook on the second side until small bubbles begin to form, approximately one minute. Turn the chapati back to the first side and finish cooking (another minute approximately). At this stage, a perfect chapati will start to balloon. This process can be helped along by gently pressing on the bread. The bread is hot, so we find the easiest method is to use a small cotton cloth or a paper towel wadded up to protect your finger tips. Gently press down on a large bubble forcing the bubble to extend itself wider. If the bread starts to burn on the bottom before it has ballooned, move the bread (with the help of your paper towel) across the skillet, dislodging it from the point at which it is beginning to burn.

When you are satisfied with your chapati, remove it and wrap in a clean towel. Continue to cook the other breads, stacking each as it is finished on top of the others.

Yield: 8 chapatis, 7 to 8 inches across, thin and supple.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  canola oil -- or olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2    tablespoon  chili powder
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yeast
                        -- Additional ingredients:
     3/4           cup  shredded sharp cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  shredded Monterey Jack w/jalapenoes
  1              small  green onion -- with stem
                        -- thinly sliced

Select dough cycle. When complete, punch dough down by starting bread machine, let stir a few seconds, then stop machine. Place dough on lightly floured work surface and let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Roll dough into a rectangle (about 9x15). Place cheeses over long half of rectangle. Sprinkle with onion, if desired. (I intended to use both onion and minced jalapeno, but didn't want it too spicy for guests. Also, you can use any combination of cheeses, just don't over-fill.) Fold dough over cheese and pinch edges to seal.

Place dough on large baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or well greased pan. Cover and let rise about 20 minutes. Bake in preheated 400F oven for 10 minutes, reduce heat to 350F and continue baking another 10 minutes. Slide parchment with bread onto wire rack and let cool about 15 minutes. Slice into 1-inch pieces and serve warm.

This can be prepared in advance. Before allowing loaf to rise, cover with plastic wrap coated with cooking spray. Refrigerate up to 10 hours. Remove from refrigerator and let reach room temperature, covered, about 2 hours. Bake as directed.

Combine yeast with 1/2 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar. Set aside and let proof. In bowl of large electric mixer, combine flour, cocoa, salt, chocolate pieces and remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Add yeast mixture, 4 cups warm water, egg and shortening.

Mix and knead 10 minutes, adding more flour if needed, to obtain medium firm, elastic ball of dough. Place dough in greased bowl, turn to grease all over, cover with plastic wrap and set in warm spot until double in size.

Punch dough down and divide into 12 pieces. Shape into rounds and place about 3 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Cover with clean towel, place in warm spot, and let rise until doubled. Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes, reduce heat to 375 degrees and bake 20 to 25 minutes longer or until crusty and done. Makes 12 small loaves.

NOTES : This recipe appeared in the Los Angeles Times food section many years ago. It does not appear in the Il Fornaio bread book, a shame, since it makes a rich chocolate bread that is not too sweet. The recipe is for hand made, but I used 1/3 recipe in my dad's DAK bread machine. My West Bend does not have the capacity and I'm too lazy to make it by hand, so I haven't been able to enjoy it in awhile.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- (1 lb.):
     3/4           cup  milk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  spiced rum
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3                     egg yolks
  3         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  2               cups  bread flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  bread flour
  4         tablespoon  sugar
     1/3           cup  Dutch processed cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2           teaspoon  yeast

Add all the ingredients to the machine according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Bake on a "light" or "sweet bread" cycle

Note:
I've used the timer cycle as long as eight hours in advance, but I wouldn't want to go much longer than that because of the eggs.

The sugar in sweet breads tends to make the bread get very brown and sometimes even burn on a standard bread machine cycle, so if you don't have a "sweet bread" cycle on your machine, either bake this on light, or stop the baking five minutes early. Something I also do sometimes is open the machine briefly several times during baking, to cool the air off inside. I'm sure someone out there has a reason why this shouldn't be done, but it works for me <g>

NOTES : During the endless development and testing process, I've come up with a bread that's just wonderful, especially with coffee on a cold winter morning.

     1/2     teaspoon.  cinnamon

* (she only used the old wet cake type ... substitute a couple pkgs of dry yeast)

Makes three 9 x 13 pans

Dissolve yeast in water and allow to expand. Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and all other ingredients, including yeast. Let rise until double in bulk.

Put in greased and floured pans. Pat the dough down and spread with melted butter.

Sprinkle sugar mixture on the top. Take a teaspoon, using the back and punch down on the dough, making holes so the sugar mixture falls into them. Don't let rise too long. Bake at 350=B0 for 30 minutes or until done.

Serve sliced and spread with LARGE gobs of butter. If you don't like raisins, pick them out and give them to Cousin Janice. She likes them - at least she used to.

The instructions I received for this recipe were sketchy - "mix and bake" were about it! So I have added directions. Grandma ALWAYS had this coffeecake when we came over. All of us who were not in church choir would gather there on Wednesday nights to wait for the singers to finish practice. When they came, we'd have "lunch," which would include this coffeecake and coffee as well as cake or cookies brought along by the aunts.

NOTES : This is my German grandmother's coffeecake recipe. It sounds like it fits the request that was made. It's wonderful with slabs of REAL butter on it! but it does stale quickly, so eat it up! You can halve or third the ingredients and make less.

NOTES : Thank you to everyone who sent me recipes for Cornbread with creamed corn. They were all wonderful and I fiddled with one until it "tasted like Grandma's". (My husband would like to add the word finally. I am forbidden to make cornbread again for at least a month. But under the circumstances I'd say that he loved all the recipes if he is willing to have it again so soon.) Below is the recipe for anyone who is interested (substitutions do work well). The time and temp are from the original recipe, I'm temporarily stuck in an apartment with a "tempermental" oven. So I cannot vouch for them, just check regularly, because mine was done in 19 minutes.

NOTES : This bread has a hearty corn flavor and a springy texture that holds up when it's dunked into soups and bean stews. For tender wedges bake the bread in an 8" cast-iron frying pan. For browner, crunchier bread bake the batter in cornstick pans for about 15 min, yields 14 - 16 sticks.

     1/4           Cup  Water
  3                     eggs -- Divided Use

To make filling: In medium bowl of electric mixer, beat cream cheese, 2 eggs, sugar and vanilla until smooth. With spoon, stir in dried cranberries. Cover; refrigerate while preparing dough.

To make dough: In large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, orange peel, undissolved yeast, salt and mace. Heat milk, butter and water until very warm (120' to 130'F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in 2 eggs, 1 egg yolk (reserve one egg white) and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

To shape: Divide dough into 16 equal pieces; roll each to 6-inch circle. Place an equal amount of filling on center of each. Bring dough up around filling, pleating and pinching firmly just above ling to seal. Place 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 60 minutes.

Uncover rolls; pinch again, just above filling, to reseal. Lightly beat reserved egg white; brush on rolls. Bake at 350'F for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown, switching position of pans halfway through baking for even browning. Remove from pans; cool on wire racks. When cool, tie each with narrow ribbon.

NOTES : From Hermine Sostarich of Brookfield, Wisconsin:

My mother, Barbara Suveljak Hosni and father, Thomas Frank Hosni, Sr., passed through Ellis Island in September 1913 from Austria-Hungary. My mother decided I should have some of her recipes. As a result, we did a "stop and measure" as she prepared Nut Roll.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  350                g  bread flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried yeast
  1              pinch  sugar
  300               ml  tepid water
     1/2           tsp  salt
     1/2           tsp  bicarbonate of soda
  225               ml  milk

Dissolve the yeast in 50 ml of the water with the pinch of sugar. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl, and pour the dissolved yeast into a well in the center, follow with milk. Mix to give a thick batter consistency. Using a wooden spoon, vigorously beat the batter for a bout 5 minutes to incorporate air. Cover and leave in a warm place for 1 hour, until sponge-like in texture. Beat the batter for a further 2 minutes to incorporate air.
Place a large, preferably non-stick frying pan on to a high heat and, using absorbent kitchen paper, rub a little vegetable oil on the surface. grease the insides of three crumpet rings or 3 3 1/4 in plain metal pastry cutters. Place the rings blunt edge down on to the hot surface and leave for about 2 minutes, or until very hot.
Pour the batter into a large measuring jug. Pour a little batter into each ring to a depth of 1 cm.
Cook the crumpets for 5-7 minutes until the surface of each appears dry and is honey-combed with holes.
When the batter has set, carefully remove each metal ring. Flip the crumpet over and cook the second side for 1 minute only. Cool on a wire rack.
Continue until all batter is used. it is important that the frying pan and rings are oiled each time, and heated before batter is poured in. When required, toast the crumpets on both sides and serve hot.

                        Crusty Italian Loaf, Amy's

                International Breads            White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           Cup  very warm water
     3/4      Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                Cup  cool water
  1 1/2           Cups  Sponge Starter -- See Recipe
  3 1/2           Cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1         Tablespoon  Kosher Salt -- Plus
  1                Tsp  Kosher Salt

Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes.

Add the cool water and sponge starter to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge. The mixture should look milky and slightly foamy.

Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass. It will be wet and sticky, with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers. If the dough is not sticky, add 1 tablespoon of water.

Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth. This is a sticky, wet dough; don't be tempted to add more flour to the work surface. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap. (This rest period is the autolyse.)

Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet still slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled.

Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become more manageable.

Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts to rise.

Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it. Divide the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each. Gently flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch it into a rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough.

Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Do not elongate. These loaves are about 10 inches long. Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape. Leave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as they rise. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours, until bubbly and loose.

Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone.

Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal. Line an upside down baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top, and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan. Repeat with the remaining loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan. Dimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places, but don't deflate them too much. Be sure the loaves are loosened from the peel, then carefully slide them onto the baking stone. Place the pan of bread on the rack below the stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist the loaves again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later.

Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.

Yield: 3 loaves

I've learned to put in less of the main liquid (milk in this case) whenever there are other liquids involved (eggs, honey, extracts, etc.) - you can always add more liquid but it's damn hard to take it back out.

For "Mexican" Chocolate bread: add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon for the 1 pound loaf, 1/2 tsp. for 1 1/2 pound loaf.

NOTES : Ok, in the More Bread Machine Bounty Book from Better Homes and Gardens, they call it "Double Chocolate" but if you use chocolate extract instead of vanilla, you can call it "Triple!" Anyway, I've made this for many people and it's definitely best when it's fresh - it might make nice French toast for kids but I never tried that. I can't stand the thought of eating bread that's more than 2 or (eeeeewww...) 3 days old - I just toss it out to the birds. Someone said if you amortize the cost of the bread machine over 20 years, a loaf of bread only costs about 23 cents...so I can't see adding chemicals to it to try to make it last longer. Might as well just eat the stuff from the store that's been treated to outlast King Tut's mummy...

In every loaf of bread I make, I add the following home made dough enhancer.

It is much cheaper (and I think better) than the kind you buy prepackaged.

This dough enhancer  does wonders for me.  If you can not find these
ingredients in a grocery store try a health food store.

I also cut the salt in half for several reasons.

1. I think most people get too much salt in their diet for good health
2. It make the bread rise higher, especially in wheat breads.
3. I tried several different breads with half the salt and the full amount
   and I could not tell any difference in the bread.

You can dry your sourdough to travel with it. Just pour a thin layer of active culture onto wax paper and leave it to dry in a clean place. A 1/4" layer may take a week to dry thoroughly. When it's dry, grind it to a powder. It will remain viable indefinitely. To reconstitute it, take some (not all - save some to correct errors!) and add it to 1/2 C water and 1/2 C flour. A quart mason jar works well for this purpose. Stir well and put aside in a warm place for 24 hours. By that time you should see alcohol on top. Add another half cup each of water and flour and repeat. If the total volume in your jar gets too high (remember, once it's active it will want to double) throw some out before you add the water and flour.

With a few repetitions of this feeding you will have an active culture.

                            Drying Starter #3

                  ****

Cover a dish or pan with plastic wrap or waxed paper to prevent sticking. After you have fed your starter and let it get active e, pour some onto the covered dish. The thicker the layer the longer it will take to dry. I use a broiler pan and pour it 1/4 inch deep as I use a lot of it. It takes nearly a week to harden.

Set aside at room temperature until it gets brittle - may be a few days. Break into small pieces and grind in a blender, coffee grinder or food processor. There you are. It will keep a long time. The yeast has sporated and will stay that way for years. At one time it was used to chink the walls of cabins an d some of that stuff has been reactivated.

The gentleman did not put his name or address on the information he mailed me with some of his dried starter. He may answer you on the Digest. He is 77 years old.

I suggest you dry some of your starter and they reconstitute it and see if it is OK.

His instructions for reactivation are as follows:

Dissolve the contents of the package he sent (about 1 heaping tablespoon) in 3/4 cup warm water (90 degrees) , add 3/4 cup white bread flour and 1 teaspoon sugar in glass or plastic container (NOT METAL).

Place the bowl (covered with damp towel) in warm place (the oven with the light on is about 85 degrees, but test it first) for up to 48 hours. It will get bubbly from the fermentation. IT'S ALIVE!!

Mix one cup warm (95) water, add 1 cup flour, l tablespoon dried potatoes or use potato water and let set in the warm place till bubbly again. Don't worry about the lumps as the fermentation will take care of them.

Now you can store it in the frig till needed. It may develop a clear liquid on top, if so stir it back in as this is the alcohol, keep it happy. It will need feeding about every couple of weeks, just add one cup warm skim milk or water, 1 T sugar and 1 cup flour. Once in a while add 1 tablespoon of dried potatoes or use potato water. If it looks sick add 1 T Cider vinegar to give it a kick in the behind. Give the excess to a friend or you can keep some of it in the freezer for several months between feedings.

When you want to bake something bring the starter up to room temperature, mix in 1 cup flour, 1 cup warm water or skim milk and let set overnight to ferment. The next morning, remove one cup to keep in a covered jar as a starter for use next time, feed it, then do your baking.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda and sugar. Cut the butter and shortening into the flour mixture until it's well distributed and the mixture is crumbly.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the dry yeast over the warm water and stir briefly. Allow to dissolve and swell. Add the yeast mixture and the warm buttermilk to the flour mixture and toss with a fork to blend and moisten, creating a soft dough.

Cover bowl and refrigerate overnight, or for as long as 2 weeks.

To bake, remove a portion of dough. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly
floured board, roll dough out to a thickness of 1 inch. Cut into rounds, wedges or squares with a knife or biscuit cutter. Brush generously with melted butter. Place on baking sheet and, if desired, sprinkle lightly with a bit of flour. Bake until lightly browned on top, about 12 to 15 minutes.

NOTES : I got this recipe out of last year's Thanksgiving Food Section, and baked it again for this year.  Really easy, yummy and convenient.A combination of leaveners--yeast, baking powder and baking soda--make these
Southern biscuits extra light. Traditionally, a big batch of the dough is made and kept refrigerated. Portions, cut off as required, ensure that every meal has a basket of piping hot little breads. Incidentally, this same dough, rolled thin or simply hand-stretched, then fried up in olive oil or slapped on an open grill, produces tender/chewy, absolutely incredible flatbreads (similar to Indian naans)--great for rolling around turkey leftovers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Cups  semolina flour
  1                Cup  plain yogurt
  1                     Fresh Red Chiles -- Seed, Devein,
                        Fine Chop Or 1 Jalapeno
  1         Tablespoon  ginger -- finely chopped
  1         Tablespoon  Curry Leaves
                        if using dried  rehydrate  before using
  2        Tablespoons  coriander leaves -- roughly chopped
     1/2      Teaspoon  salt
  2               Cups  warm water
                        Oil for griddle surface

You will need a medium-sized mixing bowl, a large cast iron or other heavy griddle, a paper towel, a flat wooden spoon or rubber spatula, and a metal spatula.

In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the semolina, yogurt, chile, gingerroot, curry leaves, coriander leaves, and salt. Add the water a little at a time, stirring while you pour. When all the water has been added and the batter is smooth, cover the bowl and let the batter rest for approximately one hour.

To cook the breads, heat a large cast iron griddle over medium high heat. Lightly oil the surface of the griddle using a paper towel, and reserve the towel for use between each dosa. When the griddle is hot, pour on one-half cup of the batter. As you pour, move in a circle out from the middle, trying to distribute the batter in as large a circle as possible. Immediately after, use the flat back side of a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to move the batter to cover the gaps, trying again to increase the diameter of the dosa. Try to make a circle 9 to 10 inches in diameter.

Over a medium high heat, the dosa will cook on its first side for one minute and a half. After it has been cooking for one minute, begin to loosen it from the griddle with a sharp-edged spatula. Coax the dosa, don't force it, as it will come off easily from the griddle when it is ready. When ready, flip to the other side.

The second side will cook in one and a half to two minutes, depending on the thickness of the dosa and the heat of the griddle. You can check the dosa by simply lifting a corner with your spatula. It should have nicely browned spots, but not nearly as uniformly brown as the first side. When ready, remove to a plate. Before starting the second dosa, rub the surface of the griddle with the oily paper towel, or if it's particularly dry, add a little more oil.
Continue cooking until all the dosas have been made (they can be stacked one on top of the other when they finish cooking), or serve immediately as they are made, flapjack-style.

Yield: eight dosas, each 9 to 10 inches in diameter

                          Grandmother's Kolachi

Categories    : Breads                          Hand Made
                International Breads            White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  flour
  1              large  FRESH yeast
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  margarine
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  warm milk
  3                     eggs

Besides the above you will need filling for the kolachi. Lekvar, poppy seed, apricot, and nut are four great choices.

Scald milk and set aside to cool. Melt Oleo and set aside to cool. It is cool enough when you can test a drop of it on your wrist without burning yourself.

While waiting for the scalded milk and oleo to cool, Shift DRY ingredients in a large bowl. Make like a crater in the center of the dry ingredients.

Dissolve yeast in the scalded milk. Pour into the crater along with the oleo. Break in the 3 eggs. Mix thoroughly.

Cover with a white towel or cloth. Set in a warm place away from drafts. Let rise until it is double in bulk, about 2 hours.

Remove dough to a floured board. Kneed the dough. Divide into six parts.

Let set and rise about 10 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile break an egg into a cup. Beat well.

Roll each piece of dough out. Spread your filling. Bring ends in and roll up.

Pinch the ends and place each roll on a cookie sheet. You can get three rolls to one sheet but don't put them to close together.

With a pastry brush, brush the beaten egg on the top of each roll. The egg will give the rolls a brown glazed color.

Bake at 375 degrees until the rolls are brown. I can't tell you the exact amount of time but, it's about 30 to 35 minutes I think.

To test for doneness: Lightly tape the top of each roll with a fork. If they sound hollow and they are brown then they are done. Remove from oven and let cool.

Now enjoy and grab the end piece before the kids find out how good the end pieces are.

If you are using dry yeast, here is a little trick my Aunt Ann in Youngstown, Ohio taught me.

Dissolve three packages of dry yeast in 3/4 cup of warm water (NOT HOT WATER OR YOU WILL KILL THE YEAST). When you see the yeast begin to bubble, this means the yeast is good, add it to your dry ingredients.

If you are using dry yeast from the bulk jars, "Fleischmann's Bread Machine Yeast", 2& 1/4 teaspoon = 1 pkg. of dry yeast. 3 pkgs. of dry yeast = 1 large cake of fresh yeast.

  1            Package  Yeast

  1                Cup  Whole wheat flour

     1/4           Cup  Butter -- softened
  2          Teaspoons  Sesame seeds
  1                Cup  Warm Water -- (120-130 degrees)

I just tried adapting a regular bread recipe for my DAK, and it's come out fine, so I'll share it. It's a Pillsbury Bake- off contest winner, from the back of a flour bag.

The first time I made it, it sunk in the middle. The next time I used 2 T. more flour, and accidently left the darkness control on the light side, so I don't know which fixed it! Does anyone know if it matters if you use sugar or honey instead of the corn syrup? The original recipe called for sticking the sesame seeds on the crust with an egg white--I've always just put them in the bread instead.

Incidentally, if you have trouble with your DAK, are you sure all your ingredients are room temperature and you heat the liquids to 120-130 degrees? (use the probe in your microwave to heat them) I once didn't heat the water because I noticed the yeast package said 80 degrees for bread machines, but it didn't come out--it was raw in the middle. Just a thought. Let me know how this works for you.

1. Cut margarine into combined dry ingredients by working pastry cutter back and forth across margarine and flour until mixture resembles small crumbs.

2. Stir together the liquid ingredients, such as beaten eggs and milk, using a wire whisk.

3. Pour combined liquid ingredients into combined dry ingredients and stir to form a soft dough.

4. Place dough on lightly floured surface and knead by pushing in dough with heel of hand. Then rotate dough 1/4 turn, fold top part of dough over and push in with heel of hand. Knead dough about 20 times. Roll out dough into a rectangle. Cut into 4-inch squares and cut each square into triangles. Also use this method to make biscuits, rolling out dough into circle and using 3-inch round biscuit cutter to cut out dough.

NOTES : I have this recipe which I love the flavor and taste of but it keeps
overflowing my bread machine. I have a Regal which makes to a 2 pound
loaf, this is only 1 1/2 lb loaf. I made it once per directions, I made
it the second time cutting water down to 1/2 cup. The recipe still rose
to beyond the pan. What a mess.

Your recipe is definitely "too wet". I'd start by reducing the water to 3/8 cup, reducing the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp and increasing the salt to 1 tsp. Watch the dough as it's kneading. If it appears dry or stiff after about 5 min, add more water 1 T at a time. Give the dough a pinch. It should be soft, pliable and slightly tacky to the touch. If you continue to have problems, let me know and I'll be happy to lend a hand until you perfect it. [Linda Rehberg co-author of "Bread Machine Magic']

NOTES : This recipe produces a thin, semicrisp cracker bread that is popular in Eastern European countries. You can soften the cracker by wrapping it in damp dish towels for an hour or so. When it is bendable, spread with a curry mayonnaise and add layers of meat, tomato, cucumber, and lettuce sliced paper thin. Roll it up, slice it into 4" wide sandwiches, and you have a fabulous and unusual late-night snack for a card party.

Like all of Lois and Linda's recipes ... this is excellent!!

  3 1/2           cups  flour
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2                     yeast cake
  2                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
  6        tablespoons  melted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        --Filling:--
  2               cups  ground poppy seeds
     1/2           cup  sweet cream
  3        tablespoons  raisins
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  rum
  1           teaspoon  lemon rind

Allow the yeast to rise in one quarter cup of warm milk until doubled in size. Sift the flour into a deep bowl. Make a well in the center and place the yeast in the well. Add the remaining milk, sugar, egg yolks, lemon rind, vanilla, butter and salt. Mix together well and beat with a wooden spoon until blisters begin to form on the dough. Place in a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about an hour or until doubled in bulk.

Divide the dough into two sections. Roll each section out very thin, brush with melted butter and fill with poppy seed filling. Roll like a savijaca* by filling the edge of the table-cloth on which the dough was rolled out. Place the two sections of MAKOVNJACA on a well greased baking sheet and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place for another half hour. Brush the rolls with a well beaten egg white and bake at 350 F for about an hour until they become golden. Cool before slicing and serving.

Filling:
Mix the finely ground poppy seeds, the lemon rind, raisins, sugar and cinnamon. Spread this mixture over the rolled out dough. Heat the cream. Combine the cream, honey and rum and pour this mixture over the poppy seeds. Roll the MAKOVNJACA up like a sajivaca.

                               Millet Bread

                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  3                cup  warm water
  1                cup  nonfat dry milk
     1/4           cup  honey -- preferably buckwheat
  5                cup  white flour -- preferably
                        unbleached
  4 1/2            cup  whole wheat flour -- (4 1/2 to 5)
  2                cup  whole grain millet
  1 1/4     tablespoon  kosher salt -- or 2 t table salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- preferably safflower
     1/2           cup  wheat germ
  1                cup  white flour -- (1 to 1 1/2)

Makes two 9-inch loaves or three 8-inch loaves

Put the yeast in a large bowl and pour a little warm water over it. Let it
stand until dissolved. Add remaining warm water, the dry milk, the honey,
and mix well. Add 3 1/2 c of the white flour and 3 1/2 c of whole wheat flour and beat about 50 strokes. Cover with plastic wrap, and let stand in
a warm place for 1-3 hours.

Stir all the remaining ingredients into the sponge, holding back 1/2 c of
white flour.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, let rest a few minutes while you clean out the bowl and grease it, then knead 8-10 minutes, incorporating as much of the remaining flour as necessary until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Put the dough back in the greased bowl, turning to coat; cover with plastic wrap and let stand about 1-1 1/2 hours,
until double in bulk.

Punch down and let rise, covered, until double--about 45 minutes.

Form into 2 loaves and put in 2 greased 9-inch bread pans (or you can use three 8-inch pans). Cover lightly with a towel and let rise 30 minutes.

Bake 10 minutes in preheated 400 degree F oven, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F and continue baking 35 minutes. Turn out of the pans and cool on racks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  rolled oats
     3/4           cup  skim milk
  1                     egg -- beaten lightly
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  firmly packed light brown sugar
                        -- or dark-brown sugar
  1              large  ripe banana -- peeled and mashed
  1 1/4           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
                        -- or unsifted whole-wheat flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

MAKES EIGHTEEN MUFFINS

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Soak the oats in the milk in a mixing bowl for 30 minutes, or until all the milk has been absorbed.
2. Combine the egg, oil, sugar, and mashed banana, beating until smooth, and stir into the oat mixture.
3. Combine the dry ingredients in a second mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Pour in the banana oat mixture and stir lightly-just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Do not overbeat, or your muffins will be tough and shot through with tunnels.
4. Grease muffin pans or line with crinkly paper cupcake liners and spoon in the batter, half filling each cup. Bake for 15 minutes or until the muffins are lightly browned and springy to the touch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For bread:
  1                cup  milk -- whole or skim
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- or canola oil
  2               cups  bread flour
  1                cup  uncooked oatmeal -- (not instant)
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt -- to taste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        For glaze:
  1                     egg white
  2        tablespoons  milk -- whole or skim
                        oat flakes for garnish


1. Remember to follow the instructions for placement of the yeast provided
with the model of bread machine that you have. Put the cup of milk and the
butter or canola oil in the baking pan first, unless directed to reserve the
liquids till last, and add the flour, oatmeal, brown sugar, salt and yeast. Use your machine's regular or quick-bake cycle.

2. After removing finished loaf from pan, and while bread is still piping
hot, quickly whip together the egg white and the two tablespoons of milk and brush this glaze over the top of bread. Sprinkle the dome of the loaf liberally with oat flakes. Some will fall off.
Return the loaf to the pan and the pan to its baking slot in the machine.
The oat flakes will cling firmly as the glaze cooks from the retained heat
of the bread and the oven and then cools. Makes one loaf.

                            Olive Ladder Bread

Recipe By     :Alford and Duguid
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads                          Hand Made
                Low Fat                         Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           Cups  lukewarm water
  1           Teaspoon  dry yeast
  6               Cups  Unbleached All Purpose Flour -- To 7C
  2        Tablespoons  olive oil
  2          Teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2           Cups  black olives -- pitted chopped
                        Nyons or Kalamata
     1/4           Cup  buckwheat flour

You will need a large bread bowl, four 10- by 15- inch or larger baking sheets that will fit in pairs side-by-side in your oven, a sharp knife or razor blade, and a pastry brush.

Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, then stir in 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour. Stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute) to develop the gluten, then leave this sponge covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours.Stir in olive oil, salt, olives, and buckwheat flour. Mix in remaining flour, a cup at a time, stirring always in the same direction, until dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn dough out onto a well floured working surface. Using floured hands, knead gently until the dough has an even consistency (apart from the olives), then knead 5 minutes longer. Clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, place dough in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 2 to 3 hours. It will have almost doubled in volume.

Oil two 10 by 15 inch (or larger) baking sheets. Flatten dough down gently with your hands, then turn out onto floured working surface. Cut dough in half, return half to the bread bowl and cover. Divide remaining half in two. Knead each half into a ball and then flatten gently with the palm of your hand. Let stand five minutes to rest. Working with each piece in turn, flatten out with your palms into a rectangle or oval about 10 inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide. It will be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Transfer each to a lightly oiled baking sheet at least 14 inches long. Let loaves rise for 20 to 30 minutes, covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack at the center of the oven or just above. (If your baking sheets do not fit side-by-side on one rack, place two racks in oven, one just above the center and one just below. One bread can go on each rack; about halfway through baking (after 10 to 12 minutes), switch the two around.) Just before placing in the oven, use a sharp knife or razor blade to make cuts through the breads: Starting two inches from the top and about an inch from the side, cut across the bread to within an inch of the other side. Make two more cuts, parallel to the first, at about 2 inch intervals (the cuts should go all the way through the dough). The dough will separate at each cut, so that the bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder; you can pull dough apart even more if you wish and if your baking sheets are long enough, by pulling gently on each end of the breads to make the slits gape more. Brush each loaf lightly with olive oil all over, place in the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Breads will be golden when done.

Once first two loaves are in the oven, oil two more baking sheets, then flatten remaining dough, divide into two, and repeat steps required to form loaves. Breads should almost have finished rising by the time the first batch comes out of the oven.

Yield: 4 loaves

                     Orange And Nut Christmas Stollen

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For the dough:
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  Lora Brody's Dough Relaxer
  3        tablespoons  almond paste
  2                     oranges -- zest only
                        -- or 1/2 teaspoon orange oil
  4        tablespoons  sweet (unsalted) butter -- melted and slightly
                        cooled
  1              large  egg
     3/4                water
  1                cup  toasted pecans -- coarsely chopped
                        To finish the stollen:
  2        tablespoons  sweet (unsalted) butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  coarse sugar

Bread machine: place all ingredients except pecans in the bread machine. Program for manual, or dough. The dough should form a very soft ball. Allow the dough to have one rise, then another short knead. Add the pecans during the last few minutes of kneading, or re-start the machine and knead until the nuts are incorporated.

Stand Mixer: fitted with the kneading attachment or Food Processor fitted with plastic blade: Add all ingredients except the pecans and knead or process until you have a soft dough that does not quite form a ball. Don't be tempted to add more flour or the stollen will be dry. Allow the dough to rise until almost double in bulk, then knead in the pecans. Don't do this in the processor as the pieces get too small.

To finish the stollen:

Cover the dough and allow it to rest for 15 minutes With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 14 inch long oval. Add flour only as necessary to keep the stollen from sticking to the work surface. Brush the surface of the dough with half the melted butter and fold the dough in half length wise. Press lightly on the fold of the dough, pressing towards the open folds. To give the stollen its traditional shape do not press the outer edges together: Transfer the oval onto a greased and floured cookie sheet, cover the dough, and allow it to rise for 40 minutes.

Pre-heat the oven to 375F. with the rack in the center position. Brush the top of the stollen with melted butter and sprinkle generously with the sugar. Bake the stollen for approximately 30 - 35 minutes or until it is golden brown on top and has an internal temperature of 190F on an instant read thermometer.

Cool the stollen on a rack before slicing to serve.

NOTES : Greetings bakers!  This is (hopefully) the first in a series of recipes that feature my products.

This stollen makes a great present. You can make one large stollen, or two medium sized.

This traditional European Christmas pastry made with fresh orange zest and pecans calls for a rich, buttery dough. Lora Brody's Dough Relaxer makes the dough not only easy to work with, but add a richness and tenderness as well.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  3 1/2           cups  flour
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2                     yeast cake
  2                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
  6        tablespoons  melted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        --Filling:--
     1/2           cup  melted butter
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  hot milk
  2        tablespoons  strawberry jam
  1              pound  walnuts -- ground
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon rind
     1/4           cup  raisins
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  rum

MAKOVNJACA Dough:

Allow the yeast to rise in one quarter cup of warm milk until doubled in size. Sift the flour into a deep bowl. Make a well in the center and place the yeast in the well. Add the remaining milk, sugar, egg yolks, lemon rind, vanilla, butter and salt. Mix together well and beat with a wooden spoon until blisters begin to form on the dough. Place in a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about an hour or until doubled in bulk.

Divide the dough into two sections. Roll each section out very thin, brush with melted butter and fill with poppy seed filling. Roll like a savijaca* by filling the edge of the table-cloth on which the dough was rolled out. Place the two sections of MAKOVNJACA on a well greased baking sheet and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place for another half hour. Brush the rolls with a well beaten egg white and bake at 350 F for about an hour until they become golden. Cool before slicing and serving.

OREHNJACA Filling:

NOTES : We have heard this Croatian bread called Potica (pronounced Po-tee-sa, and also called Kolachi, Povitica, Nutbread, Orahnjaca or Povanica. But in the village that Emily and my family come from, Gerovo, in Gorski Kotar, we call it Povitica. There is even a commercial baker in Kansas City that markets the bread as "Strawberry Hill Povitica". (Strawberry Hill being the region where our ancestors settled at the turn of the century.) What do you call it where your ancestors came from? What is the origin of the word Povitica? Call me at 913/384-9653 .

Let me just add that this is not a bread but a cake. In fact it's a Croatian walnut roll.

Just wanted to add my "2 cents" about pizza making. My husband says that my teen age daughter is a "Pizzatarian" (translation: a vegetarian who doesn't like vegetables, but would gladly eat cheese pizza, morning, noon and night). No matter how delicious my home made pizzas were, she preferred Domino's or Pizza Hut's until I used a tip from George Greenstein's "Secrets of a Jewish Baker". He suggests placing your toppings on your dough with a light drizzle of olive oil and then baking until the pie is half baked (I bake until the exposed edge of dough is starting to brown). Remove the pie and add your cheese. Then complete the baking, removing the pie when the cheese is melted to your liking. He developed this method he said, because home ovens are not as hot as the commercial ones. Doing it this way allows juicy toppings to evaporate a bit and if you like veggies less raw i.e. onions, this allows a little more cooking as well. The dough gets fully baked this way, without the cheese overcooking. Best of all, my daughter thinks it tastes like "real" pizza :-)

I make pizza for the family every week, so I guess I could contribute to this discussion.

First of all, let the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes before forming the crust. If you knead it just before you try to form the pizza, it will fight you back. I leave it on the board under the bowl for this step.

Now, you have a nice mound of dough on your well-floured board (at at least one national chain of pizza places, they use cornmeal instead of flour on the board, but they probably don't have any flour in the place since they truck in the dough!). Gently round the mound evenly. Now, with the edge of your hand, crease the dough a little ways in from the edge all the way around. It should look a little like a derby hat! Using the tips of your fingers, poke the dough all over vigorously, leaving dimples all over it. The pizza chains have a little roller with dowels sticking out to do this part.

Now for the fun part. Make sure your hands are floured well and use your fists on the underside of the dough to stretch it gently all around until it is round and flat. You may wish to flip the dough over to get both sides floured and to stretch it evenly. When it is the right size, flip it onto your pizza peel which has been well sprinkled with cornmeal or Cream of Wheat to insure that it slides off onto the stone. Pinch the edges of the pizza up to hold all the goodies, and add sauce or whatever you are using, and the rest of the goodies. (in reference to the "goodies": be careful when adding moist vegetables like mushrooms and peppers. They sweat a lot of liquid into the pizza and can cause runny fillings. I try to limit the amount of such toppings and place them on top of the cheese so the liquid evaporates during baking) When it is just as you like it, slide it off the peel onto the hot stone and bake until done. Eateateateateat....

As far as throwing the dough up into the air..."The Cooks Bible" says that any cookbook that tells you to do that at home should be taken out and burned. Now that we have said that... I have tried it, but since I have a ceiling fan in my kitchen, and usually have pretty good luck with the other method, I don't usually bother. Just be sure your arms are bare to the elbow and your watch and rings are elsewhere! It looks impressive, though!

Have a lot of fun with your pizza!

                         Pizza Dough Technique #4

I used to make pizza's at an old fashioned pizzeria. Practice really is the key, although I got a pretty good handle on it the first night, I also made a lot of pizzas that night. The most important thing is to start with a ball of dough, not something that is already flat. Then make fists with both hands and start to stretch it with the top (part of fingers that your rings rest on). Once it is stretched just a little bit, make sure you concentrate on the outside. Don't be afraid to go around the edges, letting the rest hang. This will actually work best if it is a large pizza.

If you want to throw it up in the air. Start the same way as above. Once the dough is stretched out to about 7-9 inches (for large pizza), then you can start to toss it up in the air. Try to do it in a twisting matter so that the dough will land on the top of your fists, 90 degrees from where you started. Do not try to toss it above your head at first. Do it only a few inches at first and work your way up. This will actually give you a more uniform dough than stretching it, but again it takes practice.

                      Pizza With Rosemary And Garlic

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  1 1/2           Cups  warm water
     1/2      Teaspoon  dry yeast
  4               Cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- Or Approx
                        hard white flour or
                        a 50-50 blend of white and whole wheat
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  2        Tablespoons  olive oil
                        Topping:
  2        Tablespoons  olive oil
  1           Teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2        Tablespoons  fresh rosemary springs

You will need a large bread bowl, a baking sheet 12 by 18 inches or two smaller sheets.

Place water in a large bowl. Water should be warm but not hot to the touch. Stir in the yeast and allow to dissolve. Stir in 1 cup flour, stirring constantly in the same direction. Stir in another cup flour, then stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute). This helps develop the gluten. You now have a sponge. Cover, and let stand for half an hour or up to three hours. When you are ready to continue, sprinkle on salt and oil, then add more flour, stirring it in a half cup at a time. The dough will be getting heavier and harder to stir. When you can stir no longer, flour a kneading surface well and have more flour handy beside your work surface. Turn dough out and knead, adding extra flour to your work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. The dough will gradually become smooth and easy to work. Knead for 10 minutes, clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, and place the ball of dough into the bowl to rise, covered with plastic wrap. Let rise until more than doubled, almost three hours. When the volume of the dough has approximately doubled, you can proceed to the next step.

Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored. If you wish postpone baking, gently push dough down, and leave covered in the bowl to rise again. If delay will be more than several hours, instead store dough in a plastic bag in the refrigerator (for not more than five days). Bring out of the cold and take out of the plastic bag at least an hour before you want to work with it.Lightly flour your work surface and lightly oil a 12 by 18-inch baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Turn dough out onto work surface and flatten with the lightly floured palm of your hand. Pull and stretch the dough gently out into the rectangular shape you need to fit your baking sheet. Take your time and give the dough time to rest if it is resisting stretching. It will need to get quite thin. When you have stretched the dough to approximately the shape and size you need, transfer it to baking sheet and continue to gently press and stretch it to fit. Don't worry if it tears, just patch the hole with another piece of dough and press firmly to join the edges. If you have extra dough hanging over the edge, trim it off and use it to make another small pizza. Dough should be of an even thinness across the flat part of the baking sheet and should form a slight rounded rim as it meets the edge (which is for many people the best part of the pizza). Brush top of pizza with oil, then dimple the surface all over with your fingers. Sprinkle on sea salt and then optional rosemary leaves. Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake until the crust around the edge is slightly golden, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how thin the pizza is. Remove from oven, brush crusts lightly with olive oil and also the center if you wish. Cut into large squares and serve warm or hot. We have often made pizza bianca several hours ahead, then wrapped it in a clean kitchen towel to keep it moist until we are ready to reheat it for serving. To reheat, place in a dampened paper bag in a 300'F oven for about 10 minutes.

Yield: one large 12 by 18-inch pizza or two medium, or 3 or 4 small

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --Potica Dough--
  600            grams  wheat flour -- warmed,fine-grain
                        dry
  60             grams  fresh yeast
  2 3/4     deciliters  warm milk -- 2.5--3
  100            grams  softened butter
  3                     egg yolks
  100            grams  sugar
  2          teaspoons  dark rum
                        grated peel of 1 lemon
  1              pinch  salt

Sift the flour into a bowl (cover and set in a warm place if the flour has not been warmed previously). Crumb the yeast into a large cup, add 2 Teaspoon warm milk, 1 teaspoon sugar and mix; set the yeast into a warm place to rise (the mixture should rise to at least twice its original volume before usage).

Mix softened butter, sugar and egg-yolks and beat until the sugar is well dissolved and the mixture is frothy. Warm up the milk, mix in salt, lemon peel, rum and the butter mixture. Form the dough out of the warm flour, yeast and the milk mixture -- the trick is not to pour in all the milk mixture immediately: use about 3/4 to start with, then add more as the dough forms (the quantity of milk (in the above list of ingredients) is not quite fixed -- it depends on the quality of the flour: with very fine-grain flour, very dry, use all 3 deciliter -- you should use less with inferior quality flour). Beat the dough vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough is smooth and separates easily from the spoon and the bowl. Cover the bowl with a cloth and set the dough in a warm place to rise -- before continuing, the dough should rise to twice its size.

Some Fillings

Chocolate: mix 200 grams softened butter with 4 eggs and 200 grams sugar; beat the mixture until frothy; mix in 250 grams softened chocolate (or powdered) and 250 grams chopped almonds

Walnut: scald 300 grams ground walnuts with 0.125 litre boiling milk; mix in 2 Teaspoon dry bread-crumbs, 30 grams softened butter, 3 Teaspoon thick cream, 2 egg-yolks, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves; beat 2 egg-whites until very stiff and fold into the mixture.

Hazelnut: same as walnut, only use ground walnuts instead of hazelnuts;

Tarragon: mix 100 grams softened butter with 3 egg-yolks and 100 grams sugar, beat vigorously until frothy; add 1/2 cup freshly chopped tarragon and 2.5 deciliter very thick cream (save another 1/2 cup chopped tarragon to sprinkle on top of the spread mixture)

Raisins: soak 400 grams raisins or sultanas in dark rum for 2 hours; mix 100 grams softened butter with 150 grams sugar and 3 egg-yolks until frothy; mix in the drained raisins or sultanas, grated lemon peel, 3 Teaspoon dry bread-crumbs, 1 deciliter very thick cream; beat 3 egg-whites until very stiff and fold into mixture.

Poppy: cook 0.5 kilogram ground poppy seeds in 0.25 liter milk (or cream) for 5--10 minutes; allow to cool, then mix in 3 egg-yolks, 2 Teaspoon honey, 150 grams sugar, 2 teaspoon vanilla-scented castor sugar; beat 3 egg-whites until very stiff and fold into mixture.

Cooking

Potica is traditionally baked in a round, "toroidal" (i.e., with a raised hole in the middle) ceramic mold. But whatever you use, make sure the mold is a high one - potica is supposed to raise a lot. For good potica, the proportions of the height of the mold vs. its width should be at least 2:1.

Set the oven to 200 C. Roll out the dough to the thickness of your little finger (that's the traditional measure) and spread with chosen filling, within 5 cm of the "last" edge. Roll the potica gently, but make sure there are no air pockets left in the roll (for easy handling, roll out the dough on a dry linen cloth dusted with flour).

Grease the baking dish and dust with bread-crumbs; carefully transfer the potica into the dish, the covering ("last") edge should be at the bottom. Cover the dish with cloth and set in a warm place -- potica should rise to twice its size before baking. Put potica in the warmed-up oven and bake for 1 hour; if the top starts to turn very dark brown, cover with paper.

Baked potica should be removed from the baking dish immediately (if you've greased and dusted the dish properly, you just need to turn it over onto an appropriate plate). Dust warm potica with vanilla-scented castor sugar -- but do not cut until completely cooled (traditionally, potica was always baked a day before it was served).

                        --YEAST:--
  2              pkgs.  dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water
                        --DOUGH:--
  5               cups  flour -- 4 cups to start
                        -- adding additional flour as needed
  1 1/4           cups  warm milk
     1/2           cup  softened butter or margarine
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark rum -- (or vanilla)
  1                     grated lemon rind
  1              pinch  salt
                        --FILLING:--
  6               cups  finely ground walnuts
                        -- ( approx. 1-1/2 to 1 3/4 pound)
  1                cup  finely ground golden raisins
     1/2           cup  white sugar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2        Tablespoons  dry bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2           cup  honey
     3/4           cup  thick cream -- (or 1/2 and 1/2)
     1/2           cup  butter -- (or margarine)
  3                     egg whites -- beaten stiff

Yeast:

Sprinkle sugar over yeast and add warm water.  Let it stand until
twice its original volume.

Dough:
Mix softened butter, sugar and egg yolks until the sugar is well
dissolved and mixture is frothy.  Set aside.  Warm up the milk, mix in
salt, lemon peel, and rum, and add to the butter mixture.  Form the
dough out of the 4 cups of flour, yeast, and milk mixtures.  The trick
is not to pour in all the milk mixture immediately; use about 3/4 to
start with, then add more as the dough forms.

Beat with electric mixer until smooth and elastic.  Then keep
adding flour as needed, and mixing with a wooden spoon until of
consistency that dough can be handled without sticking.  Place dough on
floured board and knead for about 15 minutes, adding flour as needed to
make a non-sticking dough.  Place dough in a well-greased bowl; turn
dough upside down to grease top.  Cover and let rise in warm place for
about 1-1/2 to 2 hours until double in bulk.  While dough is rising,
prepare filling.

Filling:

Mix walnuts and raisins, and grind them together to keep raisins
from clumping.  Combine all dry ingredients.  Warm the cream and honey,
and melt the butter in this mixture.  Add cream mixture to dry
ingredients and mix completely.  Fold in beaten egg whites last.  Let
filling cool as you roll out dough.

Assembly:

Roll out dough on table covered with a tablecloth well sprinkled
with flour.  Roll out to 1/4" thick, 18" x 24" or bigger.  Spread cooled
filling over entire dough evenly.  Start rolling up dough by hand, jelly
roll fashion, stretching dough slightly with each roll.  Start at an 18"
edge and roll in the 24" direction.  Keep side edges as even as
possible.  Continue to roll by raising the cloth edge slowly with both
hands so the dough rolls itself.  Dust away any excess flour on the
outside of the dough with a pastry brush as you roll.  Prick roll with a
toothpick as needed to eliminate air pockets.

With the edge of a spatula (pancake flipper) cut off each end of
roll to make it the length needed to fit around the inside of an angel
food cake pan.  Place in well-greased angel food cake pan or Bundt cake
pan, being sure to arrange the seam where the roll ended against the
center.  If you have a two-piece angel food cake pan, it is easiest to
roll the loaf onto and around the bottom plate of the pan, and then
lower this into the body of the pan.  Cover with a cloth and let rise in
a warm place until double in volume.  Bake about 1 hour at 325 degrees.

Put cut-off ends in greased loaf pans, cover with cloth and let
rise in a warm place until double in volume, then bake for 30 to 35
minutes at 325 degrees.

For a shiny crust, brush top before baking with 1 egg beaten with 1
Tablespoon milk, OR brush top with melted butter when taken from oven.

Let stand one hour before removing from pan.  Loosen sides and
bottom with knife.  Turn onto wire rack to remove, then turn over again
onto another wire rack to cool right-side up.

Once completely cool, turn upside-down on a cake plate and sprinkle
with powdered sugar.

Potica (paw tee' tzah) is a traditional Slovenian holiday cake.
Variations of it are also common in several other Eastern European
countries.  When my Polish house cleaner saw it on the counter, she
said, 'Oh.  Christmas Cake!'

Some of my fondest childhood memories are of being at my
grandmother's house and helping with the potica, and then enduring the
smell for hours before it was done and cool enough to eat.  My
grandmother came over from the old country when she was twenty, and
lived in a Slovenian neighborhood in my hometown, and could she make a
tremendous potica!     Well, my grandmother has been gone for twenty
years, but when I ran across a recipe for potica on the Slovenia home
page, I had to try it.  And I was disappointed.  It just wasn't the same
as my grandmother's.

So I challenged my mother to remember how her mother had made it.
And we looked up a dozen or more recipes in cookbooks and from other
family members and friends.  And we made several poticas, refining the
recipe until we had it right.  And now I can make potica as good as
grandma's.

The smell takes me back to my childhood and her kitchen, and so she
is with me still.  And my child will take the smell with him, too, but
this time he will have the recipe!

One thing to note.  Potica is supposed to rise very high, topping
out an angel food cake pan.  In Slovenia they use special ceramic pans
which are higher still.  To get the rise you should have, the
ingredients, the bowls, and the pans should all be warm, at least room
temperature, and the kitchen should best be very warm as well.  This way
your potica won't catch a chill and fail to rise to expectations.

Measurements are all in English units, but the Slovenia home page
has conversions to metric and traditional Slovenian units.

  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast -- *
  2        tablespoons  Lora Brody's Sour Dough Bread Enhancer -- ** (2 to 3)
  3        tablespoons  Hershey's Cocoa
                        -- (not Dutch process)
  2               cups  all-purpose unbleached flour -- ***
  1                cup  pumpernickel flour
                        -- or medium rye flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  altus -- ****
  1                cup  warm water
  4        tablespoons  corn meal
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  black strap molasses
  1                     egg white -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water
                        black caraway seeds

This recipe can be made in the bread machine, in the food processor or by hand. If using the mixer or processor be very careful not to add enough flour to form a discreet ball of dough as this will make for a dry loaf of bread.

* (this is not rapid rise, but instantly dissolving) such as Red Star or Saf Instant

** depending on the degree of sour desired

*** or extra to make a soft, smooth ball of dough after the first 5-7 minutes of kneading

**** Altus is a mash made by soaking small pieces of stale sour rye bread in water overnight in the refrigerator and then squeezing out the excess liquid.

Stand mixer: place all the dry ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. With the machine on lowest speed, add the remaining ingredients except the egg white and caraway seeds. Increase the speed to medium and knead 5-7 minutes, adding more liquid if necessary to make a slack, moist dough which will not form a discreet ball. Cover the dough and allow it to rise until almost double in bulk. Punch down the dough and knead for another 4-5 minutes. Allow the dough to rest, covered for 10 minutes before shaping and baking (see below).*

Food processor: Place all the dry ingredients in a large, heavy duty food processor fitted with the plastic blade. With the processor on add the wet ingredients except the egg white and caraway seeds. Process for 60 seconds. The dough should be very moist and slack - it will not form a discreet ball. Allow the dough to rise in the processor or in a covered, oiled bowl, until double in bulk, then process for an additional 60 seconds. Remove the dough to a lightly floured work space, cover and allow it to rest for 15 minutes

Bread machine: Place all the ingredients except the egg white and seeds in the bread machine and program for DOUGH using the Whole Wheat Setting if available. Watch the dough forming during the first few minutes of the kneading cycle, adding additional water or white flour as needed to form a smooth, moist, supple ball. At the end of the final cycle, remove the dough to a lightly floured work surface.*

To complete: Sprinkle a heavy duty baking sheet with cornmeal. Form the dough into a low, round loaf, cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375=B0 with the rack in the center position. Glaze with the egg wash and sprinkle with the seeds. Bake for 30-45 minutes or until the bottom sounds hollow when tapped and the top crust is quite firm, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 190=B0 on an instant read thermometer.

*The taste and texture of all doughs and this one in particular will benefit from an additional long, slow, cool rise. If you have the time, after the final rise and before shaping, place the dough in a large-sized zip lock bag and place it in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours, then proceed with the shaping and baking.




                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Like all hearty dark grain loaves, pumpernickel bread is best not overrisen. This version is dense and moist
and makes a compact, finely textured loaf. The flavor and texture are developed with multiple kneads and a long, slow cool rise before the bread is shaped for the final rise and baking*. Don't be tempted to rush the process or you'll end up with a brick. Pumpernickel flour is a medium grind rye flour which contains almost no gluten and will not rise unless combined with other flour (such as white). The traditionally added black caraway is available in specialty food stores and by mail order from King Arthur. Altus is a mash made by soaking small pieces of stale sour rye bread in water overnight in the refrigerator and then squeezing out the excess liquid.

* (my husband hates these so I leave them out)

Preheat oven to 350F. Sift together the sugar, baking soda, baking powder,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt and sifted flour. Add the eggs, oil, pumpkin
and water, mix with a mixer. The Mondale recipe recommends pouring mixture
into two greased 9 by 5 loaf pans, but I prefer to use it all in a slightly
bigger pan and make one big loaf. Bake for about 90 minutes; start testing
with a toothpick after a little more than an hour has passed.

Easy and delicious!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         ounce  active dry yeast (1 package)
     1/2           cup  warm water (110 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  caraway seed
  2        tablespoons  molasses (not blackstrap)
  1                cup  fresh or canned pumpkin puree
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Additional flour for kneading

In large bowl mix yeast and water, stirring to combine and dissolve. Add salt, caraway seed, and molasses, stirring to mix. Add pumpkin puree, stirring to mix. Add flour all at once. Stir with large, sturdy spoon until all flour is incorporated and dough leaves sides of bowl. Turn out onto floured surface. Knead until dough is smooth and satiny, about 5 to 8 minutes.

Lightly oil bowl. Return dough to bowl. Cover with clean, damp tea towel. Set in warm place (85 degrees) to rise. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down, shape into loaf. Place in lightly oiled bread pan, 9" x 5". Cover with clean, damp tea towel. Let rise until doubled and indentation made with thumb remains.

Bake in preheated 400 degree oven until browned on top and bottom sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 minutes. Remove from pan. Let cool on wire rack. Makes 1 loaf.

Variations: Substitute 2 tablespoons brown sugar for molasses, and 1/2 cups raisins for caraway seed. Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to liquid ingredients. Substitute whole wheat or rye flour for 1/3 of the white flour in original recipe.

To make pumpkin-cinnamon loaf, when dough is punched down, instead of shaping it into a loaf, stretch the dough into a rectangular shape. Sprinkle the dough with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon, then roll dough up from short side to form a loaf. Place in loaf pan and proceed with recipe.

I though I would share the recipe with you all, if interested. However, I made as called for and though it was a little sweet because I used the pumpkin for pumpkin pie (canned) which is also sweet. If you do the same use less sugar. I would decrease by 1/2 to 3/4 cup myself next time.
---

add fresh or frozen raspberries (not too many or the bread gets soggy) ... use the frozen kind that don't have juice, but just roll around in the bag like marbles. Don't thaw them, you don't want their juice to come out beforehand (or you might, and substitute some of juice for some of the liquid ... I haven't tried that). Absolutely scrumptious! You'd probably want to leave out the dates if you do this, but maybe not. [Lobo119@worldnet.att.net]

NOTES : This recipe for a 1 1/2 lb. loaf came with my Zojirushi. It has never failed for me and always makes a tall, beautiful loaf. To break the monotony, I have substituted currants or "craisins"(= dried cranberries) and most recently, chopped dates for raisins with equal success. (Not all at the same time, Please)

Add milk, oil & raisins to bread pan. Measure in all other ingredients. For placement of the yeast, follow your bread machine directions. Bake on the quick cycle. If your machine has a beeper for special ingredients you may wait and add the raisins then for less chopped-up raisins. (**this is my preference)

** A teaspoon of vanilla may be added to the measuring cup before measuring out the milk, if desired.

                Rolls                           White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water -- 110-115 degrees F.
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  skim milk -- scalded & cooled *
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  butter
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  potato flakes -- dry
  4 1/2           cups  flour -- (may need 5 cups)

* The 2 cups scalded milk may be replaced with 2/3 cup powdered milk and a scant 2 cups warm water

Combine yeast, warm water, and 1/4 teaspoon sugar and let stand until frothy. Stir to make sure all yeast is dissolved.

Combine milk, 1/4 cup sugar, egg, butter, salt, yeast mixture, potato flakes, and half of flour; mix well until dough begins to become elastic. Add enough remaining flour to make a workable dough. Let rest 10-15 minutes, covered with a towel. Knead until smooth and elastic and "blistered" on the surface, about 8-10 minutes.

Place kneaded dough in greased bowl, turn to grease all sides. Cover and let rise until double in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down and let rise again until almost double, about 30 minutes. Punch dough down and turn out onto lightly floured pastry cloth. Cover and let rest 10-15 minutes to relax the dough.

Divide dough into 24 pieces. Shape rolls as desired and place in greased pans. Cover and let rise until nearly double. (Dent will remain in dough when touched lightly with fingertip.) Bake at 275 degrees for 30 minutes (they will not be brown but will be cooked). Cool, wrap, and store up to a week in refrigerator, or up to a month in freezer.

To serve: Brush tops with melted butter or margarine; brown at 450 degrees for 5-7 minutes. Watch closely to avoid burning.

To bake as regular rolls: Increase baking temperature to 350 degrees; bake 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.

HONEY-WHOLE WHEAT VARIATION: Substitute 1/4 cup honey for the 1/4 cup sugar. Replace 2 cups of white flour with 2 cups of whole wheat flour.

NOTES : This is my mother's recipe for brown & serve rolls. She made thousands of them (probably tens of thousands) over the years, and they are wonderful in flavor and texture. Enjoy!.

This recipe can be used for all types of sweet rolls, cinnamon rolls,caramel rolls, etc., as well as dinner rolls.

     1/2         stick  butter -- melted
                        -- (do NOT substitute margarine)

(1 loaf)

Dissolve yeast in warm water; add sugar and set aside. Warm butter, oil and milk just until all is melted, then let stand until lukewarm. Sift together flour, sugar, and salt. Beat eggs thoroughly and combine with milk and yeast mixture. Beat well. Add flour and beat well. Place a wooden spoon in the dough, cover bowl lightly with a towel, and place in warm, draft-free place to rise. Every 20 minutes, beat dough down, re-cover, and allow to rise again. Do this for at least 3 hours. (Really, you have to do this or it won't have the proper texture.) After the last beating, put dough in a well-greased bundt or tube pan, cover with towel, and let rise for about 1 & 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 325F. Bake for 45-60 minutes, basting with melted butter during last 10 minutes of baking. It is done when it is golden in color.

We had to beat my husband off with a stick. (Okay, a wooden spoon) so that the rest of us could get a slice of this.

I thought I had posted this when I first made it, but a quick attempt to locate it on the B-B Digest archive came up empty. (Is there a way to search the archive that I have yet to discover?) If this is a repeat, I hope someone new can get some use out of this recipe. If it isn't, I really recommend this bread/cake/whatever as a weekend afternoon snack with coffee....heck, I recommend it for anytime!

NOTES : I took the advice of several people on this list who told me to leave the machine out of it, and I adapted a couple of different recipes for the altitude. (This is an important consideration; I live just outside of Denver with an altitude of approximately 5280 feet. That's why I've included such things as vital wheat gluten and sifting the flour.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  1% low-fat milk
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  rye flour
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  molasses

  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast -- up to 2 teaspoons

Place all ingredients in the bread pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough setting and press start.

At the end of the cycle, turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Gently roll and stretch the dough into a 24" rope.

Grease a 9" x 13" x 2" square baking pan. Divide dough into 18 equal pieces with a sharp knife. Shape into balls and place in the pan. Cover and let rise in a warm oven for 30 - 45 minutes. At the end of the rising time, remove pan from oven to preheat to 350F. Bake the rolls for 20 - 25 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.

For a smaller batch:
   3/8 cup milk
   3/8 cup water
   2/3 cup rye flour
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
   1/2 teaspoon salt
   1 tablespoon butter or margarine
   2 teaspoons molasses
   grated rind of 1/2 orange
   1/2 teaspoon fennel seed
   1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Divide the dough into 12 pieces and use a 9" square baking pan.  Proceed as above.

NOTES : Like limpa rye, a combination of rye and orange with a light anise scent from the fennel.  Especially suitable as an accompaniment to a yellow split pea soup.

This week I made a Scandinavian yellow split pea soup. I often accompany this with a limpa rye, and thought this recipe would make a good substitute. While putting the ingredients into the bread pan, I wondered about the high ratio of liquid to flour. During the knead cycle, the dough seemed rather soupy - more like a batter. I added about 1 1/2 cups of bread flour. This seemed to improve the dough. The resulting rolls were *VERY* tasty, but came out flat.

     1/2           Cup  honey
  2             Pounds  ground walnuts
  1           Teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           Teaspoon  vanilla
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  2                     egg yolks
  2                     egg whites -- stiffly beaten
  1 3/4           Cups  sugar

Dough Preparation:

Crumble yeast into lukewarm milk; add 1 tablespoon sugar, stir and set aside till foamy. Sift flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl; make well in center. Add cooled scalded milk, beaten egg yolks and eggs, butter and yeast. Mix thoroughly . Knead until no longer sticky (about 10 minutes). Form into soft ball and place in greased bowl. Cover and put in warm place till double, about 1 1/2 hour.

Filling Preparation:

Scald sweet cream, butter, and honey together; pour over ground nuts. Add lemon peel, vanilla and salt; mix. Fold in egg yolks, sour cream and stiffly beaten egg whites. Blend in sugar. Set aside. Punch down risen dough. Divide into 4 parts. Place 1 section of dough on floured board. Roll to about 1/4-inch thickness to about 9" x 22". Spread nut filling on top of dough, leaving 1/2 inch plain dough on each side. Roll up as a jelly roll. Pinch seam of dough closed. Place seam side down in 9 x 5 x 3-inch greased bread pan. Repeat with other 3 sections of dough. Prick dough on top to prevent bubbles. Cover with cloth and allow to raise for 45 minutes. Brush tops with melted butter. Bake in preheated oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let stand in pans for 10--15 minutes. Remove to cooling racks and allow to cool completely.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           Cups  warm water
  1           Teaspoon  dry yeast
  1 1/2           Cups  whole wheat flour
  4              5 cup  Unbleached  All-Purpose Flour -- Or
                        hard white flour
  1           Teaspoon  Nigella Black Onion Seed
  1         Tablespoon  salt

You will need a large bowl, and unglazed quarry tiles or a baking stone for the next-to-bottom rack of your oven.

Place water in a large bread bowl, add yeast, and stir. Add whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour and stir well, then stir 100 times in the same direction to develop the gluten (one minute). Let this sponge stand for 1/2 hour to 3 hours, covered.

Sprinkle salt over the sponge, then add another cup flour and stir. Continue adding flour and stirring until you can stir no longer. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead thoroughly, about ten minutes, until dough is smooth and easy to handle.

Clean out bowl, oil lightly, and return dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a convenient place for 2 to 3 hours. When the dough has more than doubled in volume, push down gently and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and shape each into a flat oval shape, approximately 4 inches wide by 8 inches long. Leave these flat disks out on the work surface and cover with plastic wrap to let rise for approximately 20 minutes. Place quarry tiles or large baking stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven, leaving a 1 inch space between the tiles and the oven wall to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Five minutes after the oven has preheated, begin shaping the first bread. Place a small bowl full of cold water by the edge of your work surface. Using your fingertips, first dip them in the water and then, beginning at one end of the disk of dough, make tightly spaced indentations all over the surface of the dough, so that it looks pitted, though not pierced through. Now stretch the dough gently into a long oval strip by draping it over both hands and pulling them apart gently. The dough should stretch and give, and after several tries will extend to make a long oval about 12 inches long with attractive stretch marks along it from the stretched indentations (hence, the name "snowshoe bread").

Place the bread back on the work surface, sprinkle with a pinch (less than 1/8 teaspoon) of black onion seeds, then using both hands, place the bread directly on heated quarry tiles or stone. While the bread bakes, begin to shape the next bread. Cooking time for each bread is approximately 4 minutes. You will soon develop a rhythm so that you can bake two breads side by side across your oven, one going in when the other is half done. When done, breads will have golden patches on top and a crusty browned bottom surface. To keep breads warm and soft, wrap them in a cotton cloth five minutes after they come out of the oven.

Serve warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 8 rippled flatbreads about 12 inches long and 3 to 5 inches wide, with both soft and crispy textures.

NOTES : When the machine was in rest mode I tested the dough and the texture was like silk to the touch and when baking the aroma was heavenly. We had a slice as soon as it was out of the machine, melt in your mouth softness. Highly recommended. Be sure to use real sour cream, no low fat or non fat.

This recipe went into our favorite make again and again cookbook. Be sure to try this one soon. It's like homemade bread should be.

                          Sponge Starter, Amy's

Recipe By     :Amy Scherber
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fatfree                         Starter


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           Cups  very warm water
     1/4      Teaspoon  active dry yeast
  3 1/2           Cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        -- One  2-quart clear plastic container

Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat elastic batter has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options:

If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and the strength of the

yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It's best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much.

If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but don't let it collapse to much before you use it.

NOTES : Can use 1 cup beer plus 1/4 cup warm water, if doing so, increase salt to 1/12 tsp. and leave out the sugar and dry milk .

I add the gluten because I live at high altitude, you can probably leave it out at low altitude. Also, try 1 cup water at low altitude and watch to see if it is enough.

                      Technique For Making Chapatis

Recipe By     :Toby [Toronto/Oakville] <trfox@arcos.com>

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

                  ****

RE: making chapatis - I thought your instructions for chapatis [or rotis as they can be called] were excellent - I've never measured the flour and water so I don't know about that, but I agree that warm water works well. I'd like to add that the food processor does a wonderful job of kneading the dough - I put the flour and salt in the processor, turn it on, dribble in a little oil [optional], and then add the warm water slowly until a ball is formed. The dough should be neither too stiff nor too soft. The main thing is to cover it and let it sit a while before rolling. If you let it sit too long some fermentation will occur [which is what I assume the ancient Israelites did except for the famous exodus].

When you learn the rhythm of rolling out the chapatis, you discover that they turn on their own! It's very encouraging to reach the stage at which one rolls and the chapatis turns obediently.

Before placing each chapati on the iron skillet, pat it in your hands above the bread board to release loose flour.

Warning: when cooking the chapatis, sometimes a small opening will appear and steam will escape, so it's a good idea to hold a cloth at all times while cooking it - and the cloth works well for pressing down to ensure the chapati is well cooked. The steam cooks the inside of the chapati and the skillet cooks the outside.

Prepare a plate with a clean cloth or paper toweling on it. Place the first chapati bubbled side up, and smear lightly with butter, margarine, olive oil, etc. The next chapati goes bubbled side down, the third bubbled side up, slightly smeared, etc. This keeps one side dry and one side slightly 'moistened'.
If you deep fry the chapatis, they are called 'puris' and are absolutely delicious [but not as good for you].

           True New York Sour Rye Bread, Part 1 Of 2 (Starter)

Recipe By     :Secrets of a Jewish Baker, George Greenstein
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fatfree                         Hand Made

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        See Directions for Starter Info

Starter (Prepare 48 hours in advance)

Caraway seeds can be ground in a coffee or spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. In the bakery we crush the seeds with a rolling pin. The crushed seeds disappear in the ferment and add a distinctive flavor to the sour. The minced onion helps to hasten the fermentation and adds flavor.

	1/2 cup rye flour
	1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast (see Note*)
	1 cup warm water
	1 tablespoon crushed caraway seeds (optional)
	1 teaspoon minced onion

Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix until smooth. The mixture should have a thin, soupy consistency. Cover and allow to stand in a warm spot until bubbly and fermented. It can be left up to 24 hours.

*Note: Save the rest of the packet for the first dough.

Rye Sour, Developing and Fortifying In making sour use approximately 3/4 to 1 cup flour to each 1/2 cup water. (Notice that Stage One calls for a higher ratio. This is done to adjust for the initial consistency of the starter.) The object is to make a thick consistency as close as possible to that of a soft dough. It is not necessary to thicken to the point that the mixing becomes burdensome. If the mixture is too soupy, add more flour 1/4 cup at a time. Mix until smooth.

Stage One  (Prepare 24 hours in advance)
	1/2 cup water
	1 1/4 cups rye flour
	All of the Starter, above
	1/4 cup rye flour for sprinkling

In a large bowl or container, combine the water, 1 1/4 cups of the flour, and the Starter; stir until smooth. The dough should pull slightly and may start to come away from sides of the bowl. Wipe down the sides of the bowl with wet hands or a bowl scraper. Sprinkle 1/4 cup flour over the entire surface of the sour. Let stand, covered with a cloth or clear plastic wrap, until doubled in size and the floured top appears cracked with fissures spread widely apart. This may take 4 to 8 hours. Avoid letting the sour collapse.

Stage Two  If a double recipe is desired, this can be increased to 1 cup
warm water and 2 cups rye flour.
	1/2 cup warm water
	1 cup rye flour

To the Stage One sour add the water and 3/4 cup of the flour; mix until smooth. Wipe down the sides of the bowl. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup flour over the entire surface of the sour. Allow to rise in a warm area 4 to 8 hours. Proceed with Stage Three.

As the sour begins to rise, you can refrigerate it at any stage for later use or overnight for mixing the following day. Refrigeration retards the rate of growth of the sour, which continues to rise slowly. Whenever time permits, I prefer to make two stages the day before, refrigerating the second stage overnight and preparing the third stage the morning of baking. If the dough is to be mixed first thing in the morning, the third stage is prepared the evening before, so it can rise slowly all night and be ready in the morning.
Stage Three
	1/2 cup water (see Note*)
	1 cup rye flour, or more

To the Stage Two sour add the water and the 1 cup flour. Mix until smooth. Additional flour can be added to attain a dough-like consistency. The sour, when fully risen in Stage Three, is ready for use in the dough. When the third stage is mixed, set aside 1/4 to 1/2 cup and refrigerate in a covered container with a light film of cold water floated over the top. I have kept sour under refrigeration for months at a time.

*Note: Use warm water if the sour has been refrigerated.

It is best to stir down the starter every 3 to 4 days if unused. Periodically (every 10 to 12 days) dispose of half and refresh it by mixing in equal amounts of flour and water. If there is some discoloration on the top, it can safely be skimmed off and the sour used as normal. When going away for long periods of time, I freeze a small amount of sour. When preparing a new starter from scratch, I add the frozen sour to preserve my original culture. To ensure the proper strength of the sour, in each stage you can only double the amount of starter you begin with. For example, if beginning with 1/4 cup starter, you can add up to 1/2 cup water plus flour to thicken. If Stage One contains 1 cup sour, Stage Two can be prepared with up to 2 cups water plus flour. If a large amount of sour is required, extra stages can be added.

Sometimes the process goes awry. Perhaps there is insufficient sour left to start the next batch, or the sour might have been forgotten and was left standing to get old or dry. There is a remedy. The bakers call it an einfrisch, meaning to refresh. A small amount of sour is thinned down with water to a soupy consistency. Swishing 1/4 cup water around in what remains clinging to the sides of the empty bowl can yield enough to restart the sour. Let this einfrisch stand, covered, at room temperature or in a warm spot until bubbly. If desperate, add a pinch of yeast. When ready, add enough flour to make a first stage, allow to rise, and proceed with two more stages.

NOTES : This lengthy post will tell you everything you ever needed to know about making the PERFECT New York Sour Rye Bread (tastes just like we used to buy in Brooklyn, bring home warm and slather with butter). It is from "Secrets of a Jewish Baker" by George Greenstein. If you add charnushka (black caraway) seeds, it becomes Russian Rye.

"We make the sour at our leisure and refrigerate it at any stage in its development. The first time sour is made, it is begun with a starter. After that, enough is always left behind to begin the next batch.

Sour Rye Bread

This is real Jewish rye bread, written by a Jewish baker, made for the most demanding audience in the world, the New York consumer. This bread transcends its ethnic boundaries due to its universal appeal. To my knowledge an authentic version of this recipe has never been published. Bakers, like chefs, are reluctant to part with their recipes and invariably try to hold something back. Few breads offer such a distinct flavor coupled with a unique crust. The secret of great rye bread is the sour, or ferment, that gives the bread its outstanding qualities. Sour is the product of the controlled fermentation of rye sour and water. Once it is begun, the baker always saves a small amount of sour each time he or she bakes. This becomes the starter to begin the next batch.

Sour Rye Bread is made up of water, flour, yeast, and salt. There is no sugar or fat added to this pure bread. Rye bread is ideal for deli sandwiches and as an accompaniment to meat dishes. It is excellent with cheese. A favorite of mine is cream cheese and olives on rye toast. A real Jewish treat (high in cholesterol) used to be a roast beef sandwich on rye with Bermuda onion and chicken fat (shmaltz). My grandmother would take afternoon tea with toasted rye that had the crust rubbed with garlic while still warm. She lived well into her nineties and I always attributed it to the tea and garlic, but now I firmly believe that it was the rye bread.

	1 cup warm water
	1 package active dry yeast
	3 cups Rye Sour
	1/2 cup altus (optional, see *Note)
	4 to 5 cups common flour (see *Note)
	3 teaspoons salt
	Rye flour, for dusting work top
	Oil, for greasing bowl
	1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds, or more to taste (optional)
	Cornstarch solution (see *Note) or water, for brushing leaves

In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm water and add the sour. Add the altus, if desired. Without stirring add 3 cups of the flour and salt. Gently stir the dry ingredients with your fingertips to incorporate, then stir with a wooden spoon, adding more flour as necessary until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead. If the dough is moist and sticky, add more flour 1/4 cup at a time. Knead until the dough feels soft and silky (5 to 8 minutes). Rye dough will be softer than usual and tend to feel sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and turn several times to coat. Cover and allow to rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Punch down, sprinkle with the caraway seeds (if desired).

Shaping Shape the balls into 2 free-standing pan loaves. Place on a rye flour- or commeal-dusted baking sheet. In the bakery we proof the leaves and bake them on the oven hearth using a wooden peel. Cover and allow to rise until doubled in size. Brush with the cornstarch solution, then cut 3 horizontal slashes on the top of each loaf.

Baking Bake with steam in a preheated 375 degree F oven until tapping the bottom with your fingertips produces a hollow sound (35 to 45 minutes). The top and sides should feel hard to the touch. Brush again with the cornstarch solution, then let cool on a wire rack. Yield Makes 2 loaves.

*Notes:
Altus -- is European in origin, and little known outside of the bakery establishment. New- comers to the bakery think of it as a method of using up stale bread. However, as with many old-fashioned techniques, bakers find that it enhances the desirable qualities of certain breads. Its use seems to have begun in the making of pumpernickel doughs, and the best of these breads often contain altus. Altus is a mash made by slicing and trimming the crusts from leftover sour rye bread, soaking the trimmed bread in water for several hours or overnight under refrigeration, squeezing it dry, and adding small amounts to the bread dough. Altus intensifies the distinctive flavor of pumpernickel and rye bread and helps them retain moisture. When using altus, allow for a little extra flour in the recipe. The mash keeps well, covered, in the refrigerator.

Common flour -- called first clear or clear flour, must be obtained from a bakery. You can substitute 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour plus 3/4 cup cake flour, but the bread won't taste as good. 2 cups Rye Sour can be used instead of 3 cups for a milder taste.

Cornstarch solution is used before slashing the top of the bread and placing it in the oven. Bring 1 cup water to boil, dissolve 2 tablespoons cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water; then whisk into the boiling water until it thickens. This solution may be kept for several days. For a high shine, brush a second time as soon as the bread emerges from the oven.

Variations
Onion Rye -- Omit the caraway seeds. Knead Onion Filling and Topping into the dough immediately after mixing. The tops of the shaped loaves should be rolled in additional onion topping before the final rise. Marble Rye -- 1/2 recipe Sour Rye Bread, unbaked +1/2 recipe Pumpernickel Bread, unbaked
Cut each dough in half. Flatten out with your hands or a small rolling pin. Place one pum- pernickel half on top of a rye half. Shape jelly roll fashion into a short loaf. For further variety, shape the second loaf with the pumpernickel on the bottom. This will yield 2 combination breads, 1 rye with pumpernickel swirled inside and the other a brown bread with the rye inside.
Cocktail Rye -- This can be served plain or with either or both of the fillings and toppings below. Fillings: Caraway seeds, Onion Filling and Topping
Knead one of the fillings into the dough after mixing. Roll the dough into thin baguette shapes about 1 inch in diameter and 12 inches long. Roll the tops in fillings before the final rise. Toppings: Caraway seeds with Kosher salt, Onion Filling and Topping or Kosher salt In the bakery we use pretzel salt; coarser than Kosher salt, it does not dissolve into the crust when baked. If pretzel salt cannot be found through your usual sources, try a bagel shop.

Sour Rye Bread (Food Processor, Steel Blade)
Instead of 1 cup warm water use:
	1/4 cup warm water
	3/4 cup ice water
In the work bowl sprinkle the yeast over the warm water; stir to dissolve. Add the sour and mix until absorbed. Add the altus, if desired. Add the ice water, then mix in 1 cup of the flour and the salt. Next, mix in 3 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time. Pulse until the dough tries to form up on top of the blade. More flour can be added 1/4 cup at a time if the dough is too soft. Keep in mind that this dough will be softer than usual. Process for 2 to 3 minutes. If necessary divide the dough in half and process each half separately, then knead together. Do not overmix or the dough will get too hot. Shape the dough into 2 balls, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes. Proceed as in Shaping and Baking, above. Yield: Makes 2 loaves.

Sour Rye Bread (Dough-Mixing Machine, flat Beater)
	 1 1/2 cups warm water
   1 package active dry yeast
	 4 1/2 cups Rye Sour
	 3/4 cup altus (optional)
	 6 to 7 1/2 cups common flour (see *Note)
	 1 1/2 tablespoons salt
	 Rye flour, for dusting work top
 	Oil, for greasing bowl
	 2 teaspoons caraway seeds, or more (optional)
	 Cornstarch solution or water, for brushing loaves

In the mixing bowl sprinkle the yeast over the warm water to soften; stir to dissolve. Add the Rye Sour, altus (if desired), flour, salt, and caraway seeds (if desired). Pulse with the on/ off switch until all is absorbed so that the flour is not thrown out of the bowl. Run at the first speed until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. More flour can be added 1/4 cup at a time if the dough is too soft.

Remove and scrape down the beater and insert the dough hook. Run at the first speed until the dough forms up on the hook and comes away from the sides of the bowl (5 to 8 minutes) . Turn out the dough and shape into 3 balls. Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Proceed as in Shaping and Baking, above. Yield: Makes 3 loaves.

*Note: You can substitute 5 cups all-purpose flour plus 1 cup cake flour but the bread won't taste as good. 3 cups Rye Sour can be used instead of4 1/2 cups, for a milder flavor. "
