Here's an apple bread.  Caveat:  It's a variation on an Apple Walnut bread
from my May 2001 book, but I haven't tested it this way yet.

Add the ingredients to your bread machine, except the raisins and walnuts
(and apple pieces, if you choose), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Add the raisins and walnuts at the indicator beep or up to 5 minutes before
the end of the final knead.  Alternatively, you may choose to add
everything at the beginning and let it be kneaded smoothly into the bread.

Bake on a sweet, regular/white, light, or rapid cycle

  2 1/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        -- (not rapid-rise)
                        -- or 0.6-ounce package (about 2 1/2

                        minced onions sauteed in vegetable oil
                        dried garlic chips
                        ---
                        For boiling:
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
                        -- or 2 tablespoons barley malt -- *
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
                        ---
                        For glazing:
  2              large  egg whites
     1/4           cup  cold water -- plus
  1           teaspoon  cold water

Place the yeast in a large bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the water. (If using active dry yeast, increase the temperature of the water to 110 degrees.) Stir until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside in a draft-free place until it is covered with bubbles, 10 to 20 minutes. (If there are no bubbles, the yeast is too old to be useful.) Add the remaining sugar and water and the shortening and pepper and mix gently.

Using a wooden spoon, add the flour 1 cup at a time to the yeast mixture and mix until you have added a total of 3 cups flour. Sprinkle the mixture with the salt and stir to combine. Continue to add the flour, 1 cup at a time, until you have added a total of 5 cups flour and a soft, sticky dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough, adding as much of the remaining 1 cup flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the surface, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. If you prefer a heavier, chewier bagel, add a little extra flour.

Coat the inside of a 4-quart container with half of the oil or butter. Press the dough into the container and coat the top of the dough with the remaining oil or butter. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours (the dough will rise more slowly in a cold room). Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (may refrigerate for up to 2 days).

At least 30 minutes before baking, adjust the oven racks to the lowest and second lowest positions. Place a heavy skillet or roasting pan on the lowest rack. Preheat the oven to 500 F. Lightly coat two baking sheets with the oil spray and dust them with cornmeal and, if desired, some of 1 or more of the optional toppings.

Place 2 clean towels and a lightly floured towel on a counter near the stove. Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil. Stir in the sugar or barley malt and baking soda.

Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half; wrap 1 piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate it until you have finished with the first batch. Divide the other piece of dough into 5 pieces. As you work with 1 piece of dough, keep the remaining dough covered with a towel. Draw the sides of 1 piece of dough up, pinching the ends together at the top, to form a round

ball. Turn the ball so the pinched seam is on the bottom. Stick your index finger into the center of the ball, all the way through to the bottom, to make a hole. Hook the hole onto the thumb of one hand and insert the index finger of your other hand into the hole and rotate and stretch the dough to form a hole about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. (The bagel should resemble a ring; it will puff up after boiling to resemble a typical bagel.) Place the bagel on the floured towel and cover it with a second towel. Repeat with the remaining 4 pieces of dough. (You should boil and bake these 5 bagels before shaping the remaining 5.)

Using a skimmer, transfer the bagels, 1 at a time, to the boiling water, working in batches of 2 or 3 at a time so that the bagels can swim around without touching each other. The bagels may sink at first but should rise to the surface. Boil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side, gently flipping them once with the skimmer. Using the skimmer, remove the bagels from the pot, shaking off excess water over the stockpot, and transfer the bagel to the second unfloured towel for 30 to 60 seconds. Using a spatula, transfer the cooled bagels to the prepared baking sheet after no more than 60 seconds so that they don't stick to the towel.

To glaze the bagels, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg whites and 1 teaspoon of the cold water until combined but not frothy. Strain the mixture, discarding the solids. Lightly brush the top of each bagel with the glaze; be careful not to let the glaze drip onto the baking sheet as it will glue the bagels to the surface. Lightly brush the top of each bagel with a second coat of glaze and, if desired, sprinkle with some of 1 or more of the optional toppings.

To bake the bagels, place 4 ice cubes in a bowl and add the remaining 1/4 cup of cold water. Pour the ice mixture into the roasting pan or skillet on the lowest oven rack and immediately place the sheet of bagels on the upper oven rack and quickly close the oven door to capture the steam produced by the ice. Immediately reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake the bagels for 25 minutes. Turn off the oven without opening the door and let the bagels sit for 5 minutes. Open the oven door and leave the bagels in the oven for 5 more minutes. Transfer the bagels to a wire rack and set aside to cool.

Repeat the shaping, boiling, glazing and baking with the remaining dough. The bagels keep well for 1 day at room temperature in a brown paper bag. (May wrap in airtight plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to 1 month; thaw at room temperature.)Using a wooden spoon, add the flour 1 cup at a time to the yeast mixture and mix until you have added a total of 3 cups flour. Sprinkle the mixture with the salt and stir to combine. Continue to add the flour, 1 cup at a time, until you have added a total of 5 cups flour and a soft, sticky dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough, adding as much of the remaining 1 cup flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the surface, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. If you prefer a heavier, chewier bagel, add a little extra flour.

Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours (the dough will rise more slowly in a cold room). Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (may refrigerate for up to 2 days).

NOTES : \My secret for the beautiful golden color on the outside of bagels is to add some baking soda to the water in which they boil. If you've never made bagels, be prepared to spend some time shaping the dough, or just prepare your family for the fact that these bagels will taste great even if they're not perfectly formed on your first attempt.

Since only flours containing no gliadin and prolamin can be used to make bread for people with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, a substitute for gluten must be used to make the dough rise. An excellent substitute for gluten is xanthan gum, a natural product made from Xanthomonas campestris. This micro-organism is grown in the lab for its cell coat, which is dried and ground to form xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is added as a powder to the dry bread ingredients. One teaspoon is needed for every cup of gluten-free flour. You can buy this product at your local health-food store.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        ---
     1/4           cup  poppy seeds
                        ---
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        ---
  2                     eggs
                        ---
  1 1/2           cups  ripe bananas
                        ---
                        grated lemon rind -- optional

1. Preheat your oven to 375 F. Organize all the room temperature ingredients and supplies.

2. Insert the 12 muffin wrappers into your muffin tin.

3. In a medium bowl, "lift and sift" together: 1 1/2 C "loose and level" organic unbleached white flour, 1T level baking powder, 1/2 t level baking soda, and 1/4 t salt.

4. Pour in 1/4 C poppy seeds, then "lift and sift" them into the flour mixture.

5. In a large bowl, cream 1 stick unsalted butter with 1/2 C sugar.

6. In a separate small bowl, beat 2 eggs.

7. In yet another small bowl mash 1 1/2 C very ripe bananas.

8. Combine the beaten eggs and mashed bananas in with the creamed butter + sugar, all in the largest bowl.

9. (Optional: if you like the taste of grated lemon peel, grate some lemon peel into the wet ingredients now.)

10. GENTLY stir and fold the dry flour mixture into the wet mixture, one third at a time. Do NOT overmix, please!

11. Scoop and drop 1/4 C measures of batter into your muffin wrappers.

12. Bake for 15 minutes at 375 F, until a "toothpick test" is clean.

13. Cool your baked muffins on a wire rack, still in the tin, for 15-30 minutes (good luck!), then eat right away or remove from tin and cool on the rack for two hours.

14. Place the muffins in clear view, so people will eat them very soon and demand you bake more immediately.

UTENSILS: measuring cups, measuring spoons, stirring spoon, spatula, mixing bowls, egg beater, towels, plastic wrap, baking sheet, cutting board, cooling rack, timer, scraper, sponge, scrub pad, pastry brush, thermometer, oven mitts, knife.

INGREDIENTS: butter, eggs, bananas, organic unbleached white flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, mashed bananas, lemon peel.

HELPFUL HINTS:

BAKING (Too long makes muffins dry; watch the tops brown)

DOUGH (Too sticky is better than too stiff)

EATING (Too soon after baking gives you indigestion)

MIXING and STIRRING (You don't need much with muffin batter)

BUTTER (Too much is better than too little)

PRE-HEATING (Too long or hot is better than too short or cool)

SALT (Too little is better than too much)

TEFLON MUFFIN TIN (Buy one! Heavy is better than light)

SUGAR (Too little is better than too much)

MILK (Room temperature is best with this recipe)

TEMPERATURES (You want everything to be room temp)

Most machines have you place the liquids in the breadpan first, then add the dry ingredients on top, ending with the yeast, but since some have you do it in
the opposite order, check the manufacturer's instructions. If you're so inclined, freshly ground flour can make a big difference in the flavor.

The following are some of my personal favorite recipes. Follow the instructions for your breadmaker. I eat the bread as is, fresh from the breadmaker.

NOTES : The Vegetarian Resource Group had this "formula" at their website. I thought it might be useful for those wanting to design their own breads.

My basic formula for a one pound loaf calls for 2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon yeast, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 3/4 cup liquid, 1 TB honey, 1 TB oil or butter.

I generally add 2 T gluten and 2 teaspoons dough enhancer as well as I make 80% whole wheat and 20% white. ["Bev Carney" <sinkcar@prodigy.net>]

                            Beer Batter Bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               Cups  self-rising flour
  3        Tablespoons  sugar
  12            Ounces  beer -- room temp

Mix all together and pour into a regular bread pan..Bake 350F about 30 minutes or until lighly browned on top....Remove when cool enough to handle and place on rack.

Now..seems to me that you can add some cooked well drained veggies to this..I have used herbs and sun dried tomatoes in this bread..I don't see why you couldn't use some dried bell pepper flakes or onions..or even some sauted and well drained zukes or carrots or frozen corn...I would not, however use anything like sweet potato, carrot or pumpkin puree as it is a moist heavy bread to begin with...

Did you omit salt for a reason or does the beer give the flavor without any salt?

You omit the salt because self rising flour already has it in it..Don't know where you live, but self rising flour should be available in all parts of the country..it's very common here in the SouthWest.

Could you reduce the amount of beer to add more wetter type veggies?

I personally would not leave out any of the beer..I think it needs it to rise and give the wonderful sourdough-like flavor.

Does this bread rise?

Yes, rises like a biscuit. I often use (we eat a lot of this stuff Grin>..a pie pan to get a round loaf similar to Irish Soda Bread

When I buy sun-dried tomatoes they are whole tomatoes dried. How do you get them in small pieces without rehydrating?

I use a pair of kitchen shears to cut the leathery little tomatoes into smaller pieces..about the size of a chocolate chip. <grin>..see where my mind goes? You might need to spray a tiny bit of Pam on the blades if the tomatoes start gumming up your sissors. We personally like the little tart chewy pieces of tomato in the bread. I would think you could rehydrate them partially and drain well if you don't want such a strong flavor.

What herbs have you put in this bread?

Generally I use some basil and oregano, if I'm using tomatoes..for just plain herb bread, I add some chives and/or sage too..Any of the savory blends such as Italian or Fines Herbs would be good, too.

  2 1/2           cups  warm water
  1              pinch  salt
                        -- (actually it would be better with 1
                        tbsp)
  1              pinch  sugar
  2        tablespoons  active dry yeast
  6 1/2           cups  bread flour -- (6 1/2 to 7)
                        rice flour

Place warm water in bowl. Water should be just warm to touch, about 90-100
degrees. Add salt, sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve the yeast. Let sit about 5
minutes. Add 3 cups of flour and beat until smooth. Gradually add the remaining
flour, until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Knead with a dough hook or by
hand, until dough is smooth and elastic. Place in oiled bowl and cover with
plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and divide
into four equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball, using rice flour on the
board. Place close together on a baking sheet, be sure top is covered with rice
flour. Let rise again for about 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated oven at 400
degrees for 30 minutes. Convection baking works well on this bread if you have
that option (bake at 375 degrees in that case). Turn the broiler on during the
last 5 minutes. But don't walk away! Watch carefully. The top should be a deep
brown. Set to cool on rack and listen to the crackle!
Soda Farls are seen throughout Ireland, in all bakeries and supermarkets. They
are a very simple bread, quick and easy to make. So when you're looking for
something different to accompany a meal, try this recipe. What really makes them
special is the butter for frying. It imparts a wonderful flavor and aroma. On
the farms in the past, farls were baked directly over the fire on a round iron
griddle, which hung from hardware at exactly the right level for the correct
temperature. Split them and serve them hot with butter or jam.

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads: Quick & Muffins
                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached white flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
                        ---
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
                        ---
     3/4           cup  milk

1. Preheat your oven to 450 F. Organize all your room temperature ingredients and supplies.

2. Do not oil your heavy duty nonstick baking sheet.

3. In a medium-large bowl, "lift and sift" together: 2 C "loose and level" organic unbleached white flour, 1T sugar, 1 t salt, and 4t level baking powder.

4. Pour 4 T (or 1/4 C) olive oil all over the flour mixture, then stir the oil into your flour mix with a fork for maximum 30 seconds.

5. "Pinch and fluff" the oily flour mixture with your fingers for a minute, until you have lots of little, light floury balls. Stop worrying. It's supposed to look and feel like that!

6. Pour 3/4 C milk all over the flour/oil mixture, then gently stir the milk into your mixture for 10 strokes. If the batter is wet and gooey, stir in a few extra handfuls of flour (maximum: 1/4 C). If the batter is dry and floury, stir in a few more tablespoons of milk (maximum: 1/4 C). Your batter dough is supposed to be wet!

7. Gather and scrape your wet dough onto a floured counter, then sprinkle the dough with an additional half handful of flour. Gently "pull-knead" the mass into a roundish shape, dusting the counter and dough with flour as needed.

8. Pat the shaggy dough into a 1/2" thick rough circle. Cut into rounds up to 3" across (or pull off or spoon off roundish blobs), then place the sticky pre-biscuits onto your heavy nonstick baking sheet. Think: QUICK, GENTLE, and STICKY-WET.

9. Place the full baking sheet into your oven. Bake at 450 F for 8 minutes, or until the bottoms of the biscuits are light to medium brown. It's better to underbake them. After a few times you will be able to know when they are just right.

10. Cool your baked biscuits on a wire rack, if you don't eat them immediately.

11. Let the biscuits cool for two hours. Store them (not a chance!) in a Ziploc bag at room temperature. Better idea: eat them right away with appreciative family/friends, and make some more.

Bernie says: "The moister the dough, the lighter the biscuit. Your dough should be as wet as possible and still hold its shape. The most tender biscuits are handled and kneaded just enough to mix your dry ingredients with the fat and the liquid, perhaps 5 to 10 quick kneads in all. The lightest biscuits are dropped from a spoon; the heaviest are pressed and cut."

Thanks, Bernie!

UTENSILS: measuring cups, measuring spoons, stirring spoon, spatula, mixing bowls, towels, baking sheet, cooling rack, timer, scraper, sponge, scrub pad, thermometer, oven mitts, forks.

INGREDIENTS: olive oil (or Crisco), milk, organic unbleached white flour, sugar, baking powder, salt.

HELPFUL HINTS:

BAKING (Too long makes biscuits dry; watch for brown bottoms)

DOUGH (Too sticky is better than too stiff)

EATING (Too soon after baking gives you indigestion)

KNEADING (You don't need much at all with biscuit batter)

OIL/CRISCO (Too much is better than too little)

PRE-HEATING (Too long or hot is better than too short or cool)

SALT (Too little is better than too much)

TEFLON BAKING SHEET (Buy one! Heavy is better than light)

SUGAR (Too little is better than too much)

MILK (Room temperature is best with this recipe)

TEMPERATURES (You want everything to be room temp)

A Tarheel Baker's Variation on Brother Juniper's Country Buttermilk Whole
Wheat Bread

Some years ago, I purchased Lee Bailey's California Wine Country Cooking
cookbook.  In it, I found a recipe from Brother Juniper's Bakery in
Forestville, California.  It is called Country Buttermilk Whole Wheat Bread
and I have been making it "forever."  Recently, I decided to add some
ingredients to it and this is what I came up with.  It makes wonderful toast.
***

Combine all dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix honey water and buttermilk. Add to the dry ingredients, mixing well with a wooden spoon. Turn out on a floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until it feels right. Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled (I use canola) bowl, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for about l-1/2 hours or until doubled. Punch it down and allow it to rise for another hour. Preheat your oven to 350F. Form the dough into two balls and then into loaves. Place the loaves in lightly oiled loaf pans and allow to rise, lightly covered with plastic wrap, until the dough crests above the pans, about 30 minutes. Whisk the egg with the water, then brush the tops of the loaves. Sprinkle on poppy or sesame seeds, if desired, and gently push them into the dough.

Bake for about 45 minutes until golden and the internal temperaturer (taken with an instant thermometer) has reached 185 to 190F. Allow to cool at least 45 minutes before slicing.

Makes two loaves.

Note: With all the "good stuff" in this bread, it is imperative that you use Lora's Dough Enhancer (or a similar product - if you can find one).

A rich French yeast bread that's shaped like a fat bun with a topknot. Serve them with other rolls like Whole Wheat Butterhorns.

Soften yeast in warm water. In a large mixing bowl beat together butter or margarine, honey, and salt. Add 1 cup of the flour and 1/3 cup milk. Stir until well combined. Beat in eggs. Add softened yeast; beat well. Stir in remaining flour and poppy seed until smooth. Transfer to a greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double (about 2 hours). Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Punch down dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; divide into quarters. Set one portion aside. Divide each of the remaining portions into 6 pieces, making a total of 18. With lightly floured hands, form each piece into a ball, tucking under edges. Place each ball in a greased muffin cup. Divide reserved dough into 18 pieces; shape into balls. With a floured finger, make an indentation in each large ball in the muffin cups. Press a small ball into each indentation. Cover and let rise until nearly double (30 to 40 minutes). Bake in a 325 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Do not brown. Remove from pans and cool. Transfer to freezer bags. Seal, label, and freeze up to 1 month. To serve, partially uncover rolls. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Uncover completely; place on a greased baking sheet. Brush with a little milk. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until brown. Cool.

Makes 18 rolls.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Filling
  3             pounds  ricotta cheese
  10 1/2          cups  confectioners' sugar
     1/4           cup  semi-sweet-chocolate
  1             pieces  or grated sweet
                        chocolate
  2        tablespoons  chopped citron
  10                    candied cherries -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Cannoli Shells
  3               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     3/4           cup  Port
                        Salad oil or shortening for
                        deep-frying
  1                     egg yolk -- slightly beaten
                        Chopped pistachio nuts -- (optional)
                        Confectioners' sugar

1. Make Filling: In a large bowl, with portable electric mixer, beat ricotta cheese one minute. Add 2.5 cups confectioners' sugar, and beat until
light and creamy-about 1 minute.
2. Add chocolate, citron, cherries, cinnamon; beat at low speed until
well blended. Refrigerate, covered, until well chilled-at least 2 hours.
Meanwhile, make Cannoli Shells.
3. Sift flour with sugar and cinnamon onto a board. Make a well in
center, and fill with Port. With a fork, gradually blend flour into Port.
When dough is stiff enough to handle, knead about 15 minutes, or until
dough is smooth and stiff (if too moist and sticky, knead in a little more
sifted flour).
4. Refrigerate dough, covered, 2 hours.
5. In deep-fat fryer, electric skillet, or heavy saucepan, slowly heat
salad oil (3 to 4 inches deep), to 400 F on deep-frying thermometer.
6. Meanwhile, on lightly floured surface, roll one third of dough to
paper thinness, making a 16-inch round. Cut into eight 5-inch circles.
Wrap a circle loosely around a 6-inch-long cannoli form or dowel, 1 inch
in diameter; seal with egg yolk.
7. Gently drop dough-covered forms, two at a time, into hot oil, and
fry 1 minute, or until browned on all sides (turn, if necessary). With
tongs or slotted utensil, lift out of oil, and drain on paper towels. Care-
fully remove forms. Continue until all dough is used.
 8. Just before serving, with teaspoon or small spatula, fill shells with
ricotta mixture. Garnish ends with chopped pistachios; sprinkle tops with
confectioners' sugar.
Makes 24.
Note: Cannoli Shells can be made a day or two ahead and stored, covered, at room temperature, then filled about 1 hour before serving.

Try some Fontina cut in cubes. Next, instead of rolling the crust, divide the dough in 2 pieces and roll each out into a circle. Place the bottom circle on a parchment lined rimmed pan (rimmed is important since some cheese may well leak out) or use one circle of dough to line a 10" spring form pan. Scatter the cheese over the top and moisten the edges of the circle with water or milk. Top with the other circle of dough and pinch the edges together. Brush with olive oil and allow to rise until puffy, then bake in a 425 preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until golden brown. You cna add sauteed vegetable in with the cheese if you wish.

                        *****

If you're like me, you enjoy the taste of baked goods which have been exposed to a wood fire. Perhaps you've been pining for a wood burning oven. A chimenea might fill the bill. I often bake bread on my barbecue (see our Breads on the grill feature) and I've been intrigued by the baking potential of the chimenea. A chimenea is an outdoor, free standing, wood burning fireplace made of clay. Most are made in Mexico and the design is based on that of a Mayan bread oven. Chimeneas may be purchased from home and garden centers. (Tom Whitcher of Sheridan Nurseries installed a (new larger) chimenea for us recently and he was along for the latest baking adventure)).

Please note that some dealers suggest that chimeneas not be used for cooking. However, a well made, well prepared chimenea is quite suitable for baking and many dealers sell grills and other cooking accessories. Most chimeneas must be tempered with several small fires before they are ready for normal use. Look for a hefty cast iron grill to use as a base inside. Avoid flimsy BBQ grills. Asa baking vessel, choose a seasoned cast iron skillet large enough for a good flatbread or several rolls. Follow directions carefully to properly season a new skillet. If you find old cast iron at a yard sale, all the better.

Prepare a wood fire in the chimenea. Don't use briquettes or lighting fuel of any kind. Start your fire with shavings or newspaper. If necessary, place an extra pan (a cheap aluminum pizza pan) underneath your cast iron pan to insulate the bottom. Fire or flare tiles are an other option for tempering the heat. Be aware that you're baking at a very high temperature. Protect yourself with elbow-length oven mitts and keep an eye on your baking. It will take some practice, but it will be worthwhile in the end. Nothing beats the flavor of a wood-seasoned pizza or flatbread.

Tools:
Professional oven mitts, long stainless steel tongs, large pizza wheel, baking stone or BBQ flare tiles, cast iron pan or griddle (Lodge makes a great line), cooking grill (if not available from chimenea supplier).

                        -- For 1 1/2 -Pound Loaf
  1                cup  less 1 tablespoon water
                        -- [I needed only 3/4 cup]
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- [softened]
  2        tablespoons  non-instant dried milk
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
                        -- [measured & set aside]

  3               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose  Flour
                        -- [12 ozs + 1-2 ozs extra]
     3/4           cup  cinnamon chips -- **

In a medium bowl mix 2 cups of flour, the yeast, dried milk, sugar, cinnamon, and baking powder. Pour these dry ingredients into the electric mixer bowl. Insert paddle attachment and mix on low speed until well incorporated. Add in the vanilla, egg, and butter. Slowly pour in the water. Start with 3/4 cup. Mix on low speed until you have a nice batter. Turn off machine and allow the mixture to "work" for about 20 minutes.*** Switch to the dough hook and add in the salt and a little more flour. Knead for 3 minutes. Shut off machine for 2 minutes then knead again for another 3 minutes, adding more flour if dough is too slack. (On the other hand, if dough is way too dry add a tad more water, a tablespoon at a time). Shut machine off and rest the dough another 2 minutes. Knead again for 3-4 minutes, now adding in the cinnamon chips a little at a time until all are incorporated. Stop machine, remove dough and place on a greased work table. Knead the dough just enough to insure that chips are well distributed. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover and allow to rise (about an hour or so). Knock down the dough and allow it to rest 10 minutes. Shape and place in a well greased 8 x 4 x 3 loaf pan. Cover and allow to proof (30-45) minutes. Dough should rise a scant inch over rim of pan.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350F.

Options before baking: Slash top with a cross before placing into oven. You might also glaze the top with a mixture of 1 small egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons water. This will give the bread a beautiful golden shine.

Bake the bread for about 50 minutes, tenting after 40 minutes if it becomes too brown.

Should you not use the egg/water mixture before baking, brush the baked loaf with softened butter when you remove it from the oven.

Remove bread from pan and allow to cool slightly on a wire rack, if you can wait that long....It's good warm slathered with butter and I bet delicious lightly toasted.

NOTES : Joan <NorthStarKennels@aol.com> submitted a wonderful recipe a few weeks ago for Cinnamon Chip Loaf. Just made it myself (the smaller of the two loaves) and it is wonderful. In case some of you don't have a bread machine don't despair, you can make it by hand or as I did in my KA mixer. King Author Flours sells the cinnamon chips and also cappuccino chips. Next I'll try this recipe using the latter chips with a tablespoon of espresso power or cappuccino mix.

Here are the ingredients I used and the method:

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2               cups  flour -- sifted *
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     3/4           cup  nuts -- **
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon -- ***
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  sour cream

* (I first SPOON the flour into the cup, not scoop it up)
** (I always toast them, and add lots more)
*** (really pungent stuff from Penzey's: Vietnam; China Cassia)

Grease and flour a bundt pan.
Cream together butter and sugar. Add eggs and beat till smooth. Add sour cream and mix till smooth.
Sift together flour, soda, and baking power, and add gradually to the batter.
Add vanilla.
Mix together the nuts, cinnamon, and sugar.

Put half the batter in the prepared pan, sprinkle with half the streusel, and repeat with the rest. OR--put some whole nuts in the bottom of the pan, then some of the streusel, half the batter, more streusel, and the other half of the batter.

Two sets of baking instructions (and I don't know if there's any difference in the product): (1) Bake 50 minutes at 350 F. or (2) Put in a cold oven, set at 350, and bake 55 minutes or more. Test for doneness; it may not look done.

NOTES : This is the straight recipe in which I accidentally doubled the sour cream, and it was a hit.

Sorry for the ambiguity, all. The recipe as shown was the original (what
I called "straight") recipe, and when I doubled it I dumped in the whole

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- (4 to 4 1/2)
  2               cups  yellow corn meal
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dried mince onions
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast
                        -- (4 1/2 teaspoons)
     1/4           cup  lightly salted butter or margerine -- at room temperature
  2               cups  hot water
                        -- (about 130 degrees F)
  1              large  egg

1) In the large bowl of an electric mixer, mix 1 1/2 cup of flour and the 2 cups corn meal, sugar, salt and yeast, minced onion, poultry seasoning and chopped celery. Add butter.

2) Pour in the hot water and beat 2 minutes at medium speed, scraping bowls occasionally with a rubber spatula. Add the egg and 1 1/2 cups more flour, or enough to make a thick batter. When smooth, beat 2 minutes longer at high speed.

3) With a spoon, gradually stir in just enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.

4) turn out the dough onto a well floured surface (use some of the remaining flour) and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth, adding only as much flour as needed to prevent dough from sticking. This dough will be a little shaggy.

5) shape dough into a ball, cover with bowl turned upside down, and let stand for 20 minutes.

6) uncover dough, punch down. At this point you can refrigerate it or you can bake it. Since I crumble it up when I make dressing, I put it in a loaf pan. and allow it to rise for about an hour

7) heat oven to 400 degrees F. If you refrigerated the dough, allow the dough to come to room temperature (about 1/2 hour) before baking. Bake at 400 degrees for 25-35 minutes or until when thumped, it sounds hollow.

NOTES : I usually make bread and cornbread to create turkey dressing but I found an easier way which involves corrupting my favorite roll recipe from the Redbook Breadbook

I usually end up adding more stuff to the dressing when I make it - sausage, turkey drippings, other seasonings.

I got the original idea from a King Arthur recipe but I lost it and made up my own that seems to work okay...

  1               cups  fresh cranberries -- chopped
     1/2          cups  chopped nuts
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  2               cups  flour (all purpose)
  1               cups  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder

  1                     beaten egg
     3/4          cups  orange juice

This recipe is from the back of the Ocean Spray cranberry package and is a great way to use up that last cup of cranberries.

You can also turn this recipe into a batch of muffins, just raise the heat to 375F and reduce the time according to your oven.

Grease and flour a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Mix together prepared berries, nuts, and orange peel. Set aside. Mix dry ingredients. Cut in shortening. Stir in OJ and egg, mixing just to moisten. Fold in cranberries, nuts and orange peel. Spoon into prepared pan. Bake about 60 minutes at 350F or until tester comes out clean. Cool 15 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely.

PS: Left over cranberry sauce is delicious in baked acorn squash or (if you're a squash hater) use it as a topping on whole grain pancakes!!

  1                     egg
     3/4           cup  orange juice

Makes a great gift during the holidays!

Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Grease a 9 x 5 x 3-inch pan; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, soda, and salt. Stir in orange rind, cranberries, and nuts. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter, sugar, and egg with electric mixer until smooth. Blend in orange juice. Stir in flour mixture, stirring until just combined.
Spoon into prepared pan and bake for 1 hour, or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before removing from pan. Cool on wire rack. Wrap tightly to store. Makes 1 loaf.

I live in Mexico and we can't buy fresh or frozen cranberries down here. We do have canned ones. So what I did in this recipe was just subtituted one can of whole berry Cranberry Sauce for the sliced fresh Cranberries. (I didn't do the Orange zest either) It came out surprisingly good. I am going to keep the recipe and make it often in the future.

I download the original from www.cooksRecipes.Com and they have about 8 other bread/muffin recipes with cranberries.

  1              whole  cranberry sauce -- (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts

Here is a recipe from The American Country Inn Bed and Breakfast Cookbook, by Kitty and Lucian Maynard, which may fill the bill for your cranberry sauce excess. I have yet to try it, so I cannot vouch for its deliciousness but it sounded good to me.


Cream butter and sugar together, add eggs, beat well. Mix dry ingredients together, and add alternately with sour cream to butter mixture. Add extract. Place 1/2 of batter on bottom of greased tube pan. Swirl 1/2 of cranberry sauce over batter. Sprinkle with half of walnuts. Repeat layers. Bake at 350F 55 - 60 minutes.

You might be able to freeze the sauce, or use in place of jam for a crumb-bar type cookie. I think a yeast bread would be weighed down by the addition of the sauce, unless maybe it was rolled up as a filling, cinnamon-roll style or some such. Hey-that might be good, with some cream cheese icing on top....Darn, now I'm hungry again.

Mix the dry ingredients together and add the cream. Turn dough out onto a bread board when it won't stir anymore and knead for a minute or two, until the dough holds together and all of the flour mixture is absorbed. Roll out to about 3/4 inch thick and cut into biscuits. Bake at 425 degrees for 15-18 minutes, or until lightly browned.

I took the plunge and fed my starter the potato water. It bubbled away happily all afternoon. I am looking forward to the next batch of pancakes to see if the flavor was affected, but in the meantime, it smells good.

NOTES : Some time ago I posted a recipe disliked by my daughter Angela because of its "funky" ingredients. This recipe is one of the seemingly few things I bake of which she approves. Not only does she like these biscuits, she dearly loves them and it wouldn't be Thanksgiving for her without 'em. They are easy and delicious.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         cups.  yellow cornmeal
  2              cups.  flour -- about
     3/4         cups.  cold water
  2        tablespoons  olive or salad oil
  1              large  onion -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

About 1-1/4 hours before serving:

Put cornmeal and 2 c. flour into a medium bowl. Gradually stir in water. Knead dough with hand for 2 minutes or until smooth. cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes. While dough is resting, in a 10" skillet over medium heat, cook onion, basil and salt in oil until onion is tender.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Turn dough onto floured surface; knead about 2 minutes until dough is not sticky, adding more flour if needed. With floured rolling pin, roll dough into 12" round. Spread onion mixture over dough; fold in half, then in half again. Pinch to seal edges. Roll into 14" round - edge will be irregular.

Place on large baking stone or cookie sheet. Bake 15 minutes. Remove from oven and arrange sauce and toppings of your choice on top. Bake an additional 15 minutes or until crust browns and cheese is bubbly.

***********************

This recipe is easy to experiment with. Try adding more/different herbs to the onions or to the crust, or cook it on the grill. Do the final rolling on lightly oiled foil. Oil the top of the crust and put it, top side down, on the grill. Close cover and take off grill when the crust is lightly browned on the bottom, placing it bottom side up on a pan or the foil. Add sauce and toppings, return to the grill and cook with cover down until crust is baked and cheese is melted.

     1/2           cup  raw sunflower seeds -- (optional)
                        -- or cooked rye grain
                        -- or cooked oatmeal
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour

     1/4           cup  molasses
  1                can  beer -- (12-ounce)

"To dry ingredients, you may add 1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds, or 1/2 cup cooked rye, or 1/2 cup cooked oatmeal, or anything else that won't absorb much liquid. Mix all ingredients well (I usually mix the dry ones first). Put into greased loaf pan. Bake about an hour at 400. Test for doneness with wooden toothpick - it often looks done when it isn't. You can play with this recipe, so long as you keep the 2 1/2 cups of flour (and the baking powder and soda) and the beer constant. If you want it less sweet, cut down on the sugar. The smaller portions of flour may be varied as you wish: 1 cup soy, no whole wheat; all whole wheat; or rye can be put in instead. Standard loaf pan is OK. If you can find a smaller one, you'll get a little better shaped loaf, but the quality of the bread is the same. If you want to wait, I'll bring you an extra loaf pan at Thanksgiving."

NOTES : More than food, my grandmother (Dortha Juanita Gans Thomas 1907-1988) craved the conversation and sense of connection that came with company. She had little patience for cooking, and little confidence in her abilities in the kitchen. The easier a dish was to cook, the better: It was more likely to turn out well, and she was able to move more quickly into the living room where the others were sitting and talking. Dot's beer bread is healthful and easy, a favorite recipe by all accounts. And a family story tells how Dot - A Church of the Brethren teetotaler - endured embarrassment each time she purchased the necessary beer.

The recipe is printed just as it appears on the blue recipe card my grandmother gave to my aunt.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        -- more if needed
     1/2           cup  ground almonds
  1                cup  sugar
  2                     extra large eggs
     1/4           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  amaretto
                        -- or nocello
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1                cup  walnuts
  1                cup  blanched almonds -- whole

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; lightly grease 2 cookie sheets with softened butter and dust with flour, shaking off the excess. In a large bowl, combine the flour, ground almonds, sugar, eggs, rum, liqueur, vanilla extract, cinnamon and baking powder; beat with a heavy wooden spoon until well blended. Stir in the walnuts and whole almonds. The dough should be soft and a bit sticky, but it should hold its shape when picked up. If it is too runny, add more flour. With your hands, scoop up half of the dough; shape into a long cylinder, about the length of a roll of paper towel. Place on the cookie sheet so that it does not touch the edge of the pan. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown and firm. They will spread during baking. Remove the cookie sheets from the oven to a wire rack; let stand for 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully loosen the cylinders from the cookie sheets, using metal spatulas. Let stand on a cutting board until almost at room temperature. With a serrated bread knife, cut each of the cylinders into crosswise slices about 1-inch thick. Place the sliced, a cut side up, on the cookie sheets. Return the cookie sheets to the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes to let the cookies out and turn slightly golden. Cool completely before storing.

This turned out wonderful!! Taste, aroma, texture were very nice.

We also made this using the time delay and it was very nice to wake up to the aroma of freshly baked bread. We used the programmable setting adding 5 min onto the preheat and 5 min to the first rise. It was perfect!!

Again we made this using the pause feature ... to add basil and ground rosemary. It was again a totally different loaf, but the texture, flavor and aroma were heavenly.

NOTES : Next we make a 2 lb loaf of Easy French Bread.  We used the delay baking to
see how that will work out.  Made the recipe exactly as written this
time.  It turns out very, very good!!  The texture was quite good.

Another day we make another 2 lb loaf of the same Easy French Bread recipe
and use the programmable abilities of the machine.  We set it up to have a
delayed start also.  The machine is very easy to program.  Even more so
then the Zo I used at Lora's house a few years ago when they were first
out.  We added 5 minutes to the preheat and 5 minutes to the 1st rise.  The
texture of this was even better then the first loaf of Easy French Bread we
made.

                        WREATH
  3        Tablespoons  warm water
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1            package  yeast -- (1 Tablespoon)
                        ---
  3 3/4           cups  bread flour
  3        Tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
                        -- (preferably freshly ground)
                        ---
  1                cup  dairy eggnog
                        -- (may need 2 Tablespoons  more)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
                        ---
                        TO COMPLETE:
  1                     egg white
  1         Tablespoon  water
                        coarse sugar
                        -- (pearl sugar can be ordered from King
                        -- Arthur and is beautiful)
                        sliced almonds
  10                    candied cherries -- halved


1. Combine yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar and warm water. Let stand while measuring the rest of the ingredients.

PROCESSOR METHOD: Place dough blade in workbowl. Add flour, butter, salt, remaining sugar and nutmeg. Pulse. Stir together the eggnog with the extracts. Set aside. Turn machine on and pour the yeast in through the small feed tube. Without stopping the machine, pour in the eggnog mixture in a slow steady stream. Add the extra 2 Tablespoons eggnog, if needed, to pull the dough together into a ball. Let ball revolve about 30 times in the workbowl to fully knead it.

Place dough in an oiled bowl or a plastic bag and set in a warm place to rise. NOTE: sweet, rich doughs often take longer to develop, perhaps 75-90 minutes to double--watch to see how yours acts.

MIXER OR HAND METHOD: Put proofed yeast in a large bowl. Add eggnog, extracts and melted butter. Stir to combine. Add nutmeg and salt. Add half of the flour and beat for 2 minutes. Add half of remaining flour and beat again for 2 minutes. Empty remaining flour into the dough. Knead dough for about 8 minutes. Dough should be soft but not overly sticky. Set in warm place until doubled. See NOTE above.

BOTH METHODS: Spray smooth work surface with non-stick pan spray. Spray a large cookie sheet. Empty risen dough out onto sprayed area and shape into a roll about 22-24 inches long. Cut this roll in half, lengthwise. Starting in middle, working to both ends, lap the 2 long pieces over and over each other to form one long twisted rope shape. Lift rope onto cookie sheet. Shape rope into a round wreath, joining a top twist from one end to a bottom twist from the other end. Repeat with other 2 ends. Cover loosely with sprayed plastic wrap and set aside to double in size. BEFORE DOUGH FINISHES DOUBLING, PREHEAT OVEN TO 375 DEGREES.

Whisk egg white and water together. When dough has doubled, brush with egg white mixture then sprinkle first with sliced almonds and then the coarse sugar. Stick halves of the candied cherries, firmly, around as you like. BAKE FOR 25-30 MINUTES. Transfer to rack to cool. Cover when cooled

Serve with EGGNOG BUTTER
Beat with mixer until smooth and fluffy: 1 stick unsalted butter (important that it be unsalted), 1/3 cup eggnog, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 2 Tablespoons powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice. NOTE: This mixture takes a long time to get smooth---i.e., 5-6 minutes. Keep beating and it will come together nicely. Mound in a bowl and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving as a spread for slices of the wreath.

NOTES : Many processors will not handle bread dough successively--from experience
I know the Cuisinart brand will---both the older models and the new one
that just came out. I have the older model and have made hundreds of
loaves with it.

The recipe is great for the coming holiday season.

                 Four Methods For Producing Yeast Doughs

Methods and tips

Four methods for producing yeast dough

Bread dough or any yeast dough for that matter, can be made in a number of ways - depending on what you have on hand in the way of appliances and your preference or inclination. I use something recommended by many Parisian bakers called the "autolyse". In this method, the dough is mixed into a soft mass, then allowed to rest for 10 to 12 minutes. In this rest, the dough changes its nature - miraculously. After that, it is easier to handle the dough and you will find you do not have to add as much flour to prevent it from sticking. I have incorporated autolyse in the hand, the dough hook & mixer, and bread machine methods.

Remember, all roads lead to Rome and don't get caught up with one method. Given a choice, I would go with hands-on any day. However, some days, better to let the bread machine make the pizza dough and concentrate on something else. The food processor, which is useful for a number of baking duties, is fourth on my list of preferred methods. It does an adequate job but the dough usually produces a dense crumb. Some people swear by it for wet, slack, French doughs but I prefer hands-on, dough hook and bread machine - in that order.

By hand: For this method, you can use either all-purpose flour, all bread flour, or a mix of both. Place water and a pinch of sugar (usually called for in recipe) in a large bowl. Stir in yeast and allow it to sit a moment until it looks dissolved or swells. Stir in any other ingredients (eggs, oil for instance) and flour. When mixture can no longer be stirred by hand, begin kneading, on a lightly floured work surface. Dust in more flour, conservatively, as required. After five minutes - STOP. Let dough rest ten minutes. Then resume kneading, another five minutes until dough is smooth, supple and elastic. Slap it around during this time as well - it helps the dough get into shape! Place dough in a lightly greased bowl and insert bowl in a large plastic bag and allow to rise, as per recipe. Dough hook and mixer: Place water, a pinch of sugar and yeast in bowl of electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Let mixture sit until yeast swells or looks dissolved. Stir in salt, fat or oil and most of flour and using the paddle, on slow speed, mix to make a soft mass of the dough. Stop and allow dough to rest ten minutes. Stir in remaining flour and attach dough hook. Knead, on slow speed about five to 8 minutes, depending on recipe and dough, until dough is smooth and clears the sides and bottom of work bowl. Dust in flour as required to achieve this. Remove dough from work bowl and knead briefly by hand on a lightly floured work surface. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl and insert bowl in a large plastic bag and allow to rise, as per recipe.

Bread machine: Add ingredients to machine bread pan in order given or as per machine instructions. Program on 'dough' mode. Allow dough to mix about four minutes or so until a soft mass forms. Turn machine off and let dough rest ten minutes. Reset machine to 'dough' mode. Dust in flour, if you think dough is too sticky (it should clear the bottom of the bread pan). A soft, supple dough is easier to work with so take care not to make a springy or heavy dough. Let dough rise in machine. When it is ready, proceed with recipe instructions.

Food processor: Place water, sugar, yeast, salt, and fat called for in recipe (oil or solid fat - or none) in bowl of food processor and pulse to dissolve sugar and salt. Stir in most of flour called for in recipe and process until a soft ball forms. Remove from machine and knead briefly, by hand, on a lightly floured surface. Allow to rest a moment. Then place dough in a lightly greased bowl and insert bowl in a large plastic bag and allow to rise, as per recipe.

For ALL doughs after they have risen:
Deflate dough very gently before using and allow dough to rest 15 minutes before proceeding to next step (dough likes a rest in between any sort of handling). Alternately, refrigerate dough in an oiled plastic bag for up to two days, deflate as you see fit - to allow trapped gases to escape.

Joni Repasch wanted to know how I fared with hand kneading this recipe that
Reggie posted in bread machine format. Here's how and what I did:

Mix all dry ingredients thoroughly and then stir in olive oil and water. Turn out on a lightly floured surface and knead until the dough passes the "stick-your-finger-in-it" test. Place in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Punch down and let rise for another hour. Preheat oven to 450F with a baking stone. Punch down and shape into a boule. Let rise for 30 minutes while oven is cranking up. Slash and spray top of dough (I sprinkled some ground thyme on top). With a peel, slide onto stone, spray oven with water, and turn heat down to 400F. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the bread's interior temperature is 190F and crust is golden brown. Cool on rack for at least 45 minutes before slicing. Note: I find that this bread has somewhat of a cake-like consistency. I didn't care for it too much as a dinner bread (dipped in olive oil), but it was great this morning when I toasted it.

We used the delay time setting and awoke to the incredible aroma of fresh bread baking. What a special treat to have this bread in the morning. It was excellent with a very good texture and nice crunchies that both Jeff and I love. It is very good toasted and plain ... did try it toasted with margarine but I wasn't too fond of it that way. I like the taste of bread plain or toasted and plain. I am not too fond of added flavors messing up the wonderful flavor of bread.

Stir in brandied fruit mixture, almonds, lemon peel and enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up . Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.)

Punch down dough; divide into halves. Press 1 half into an oval, about 10 x 7 inches. Brush with melted margarine. Fold lengthwise in half; press folded edge firmly. Place stollen on greased cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. cover; let rise until double, 45 to 60 minutes. Brush with melted margarine. Heat oven to 375F. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Brush with melted margarine; sprinkle with powdered sugar.


Notes from Ruth:

This bread takes a long time to rise since it is so rich. I give it a lot more time than the recipe. Go shopping.

If you are going to the trouble to make something special, use butter, not margarine. It's worth it.

I skip the powdered sugar--too messy.

                        *****

The greatest problem people have with bread baking is the yeast. If the liquid added to the yeast is too hot or too cold, it will kill it. With the advent of SAF--instant yeast--this problem is eliminated because there is no need to proof it. The yeast is added to the flour with room temperature water and does not need to be dissolved first in liquid. It is available at specialty stores and by mail order from King Arthur (call 800-827-6836 or see www.kingarthurflour.com).

It is also reassuring to know that if time does not allow you to complete the bread dough risings as specified, it's fine to deflate the dough, place it in a bowl and cover it (or wrap it in plastic wrap or a resealable plastic bag) and refrigerate it for several hours, overnight or even for as long as two days before finishing the rising and baking.

Optional ingredients such as barley malt and citric acid result in a slightly higher rise. They are available locally at some grocery stores or by mail order from King Arthur Flour (see above).

The recipes here include instructions for baking with baking sheets, but a good quality baking stone and a peel--a wood paddle used to slide the bread onto the stone--are also great aids to the home baker.

Store baked bread at room temperature or in the freezer and defrost to room temperature or reheat it. Do not refrigerate it: The starch in the flour crystallizes when cold.

A sure way to know what is going on inside the bread and ensure that it is fully baked is to insert an instant thermometer into the center. It should read 190 degrees when done.

* High-gluten flour will produce the chewiest bagels, but bread flour will also make a good product. King Arthur's special bread flour results in a better rise for the rye bread.

* Store rye flour and caraway seeds in the refrigerator.

* Allow the water used to make bread dough to sit uncovered overnight to dissipate the chlorine or use bottled water.

Here's my favorite whole wheat pizza dough that I've developed for a forthcoming cookbook emphazing delicious, nutritious, and expeditious vegetarian cooking. If you have any suggestions for improvement, I'd love to hear them.

Use this whole wheat dough for calzones and braided breads, too. Preparation Time: 5 minutes
Bread Machine Time: 1 1/2-2 hours
Makes: 2 1/4 pounds dough; 2 (14-inch) thin-crust pizzas

Place ingredients in bread machine in order recommended by manufacturer. Select dough cycle and press start. Check dough after 5 minutes of kneading, and adjust water or flour as necessary to achieve a soft ball. When dough cycle is completed, follow recipe for Whole Wheat Pizza.

  6              ounce  low fat lemon yogurt
     2/3           cup  double strength tea -- *
     1/2           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                     egg

  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray 2 loaf pans, 8 1/2 inches by 4 inches with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, tea, honey, oil and egg with wire whisk or fork, mix well.

Stir in oats and let stand for 10 minutes. In medium bowl, combine flour, lemon peel, baking powder, baking soda and salt, mix well. Add to oat mixture; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Do not overmix. Pour into prepared pans.

Bakr 30-35 minutes or until wooden pick/cake tester comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Cool completely in pan or wire rack. Store tightly wrapped up to 3 days, may be frozen for longer storage.


* to brew double strength tea, bring 2/3 cup water to a rolling boil. Pour boiling water over 2 tea bags. Let stand for 4 minutes, then remove tea bags. Cool to room temperature before using.

I normally use regular tea for this, but I imagine you could use whatever tea you'd like, just follow the instructions for brewing time.

  1         tablespoon  yeast
  1                cup  toasted garbanzo flour
  1                cup  white whole wheat flour
  1                cup  unbleached all purpose flour
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  tahini

                        peanut butter)
  8             ounces  water -- (8 to 10)
                        plus a few extra tablespoons -- *
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds

*  few additional  tables extra if necessary to create a soft,supple ball of dough after 5-7
minutes kneading.

Place everything except the sesame seeds in a bread machine and program for dough cycle. This dough is tacky, but should form a discreet ball. If it looks dry and crumbly after the first three minutes of kneading add 1 to 2 additional tablespoons water.

At the end of the final rise, gently deflate the dough and roll it out to the desired size, fitting it into a pizza pan or on a cornmeal dusted pizza peel (if you are using a baking stone) - this makes a better thick crust pizza than a thin one. Allow to rise covered with a clean towel until almost slightly puffy. Drizzle with olive oil and top with sesame seeds, or add your favorite topping. Bake in a preheated 425F oven for 15-18 minutes or until the top is well browned and the bottom is dry.

NOTES : This is for Patrick who wanted a whole wheat pizza crust.  This may be more
elaborate than what you were looking for  - but it does make a fabulous
crust while offering the benefit of the complete protein created by mixing
legumes and carbohydrates.

Toasted garbanzo flour combined with light whole wheat flour gives this flat bread a wholesome nutty taste. Sesame seeds both ground (tahini) and whole, add a sweetness and crunch.

The combination of legumes (garbanzos) and whole wheat flour create a perfect protein which needs only a salad to make a nutritious meal.

  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        -- (not rapid-rise)
                        -- or 1 tablespoon fresh yeast
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  3               cups  warm water

  1         tablespoon  barley malt -- (optional)*
                        -- or diastatic malt powder
  2          teaspoons  deli rye flavor -- (optional)
     1/4      teaspoon  citric acid -- (optional)
                        -- Generous
  2               cups  rye flour
     1/4           cup  caraway seeds
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus additional for
                        the bowl
  2          teaspoons  cornmeal

Place the yeast in a small bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the water. (If using active dry yeast, increase the temperature of the water to 110 degrees.) Stir until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside in a draft-free place until covered with bubbles, 10 to 20 minutes. (If there are no bubbles, the yeast is too old to be useful.)

In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, 3 cups of the bread flour, 2 tablespoons of the remaining sugar, the remaining 2 3/4 cups water and the optional malt, deli rye flavor and citric acid, if using. Whisk until very smooth, about 100 strokes; set aside.

In a very large bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 cups of the bread flour, the rye flour, the remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar, the caraway seeds and salt. Gently scoop the flour mixture onto the reserved yeast mixture to form a blanket. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until the dough has risen considerably, 4 to 5 hours (may refrigerate for as long as overnight).

Add the oil to the dough and, using a wooden spoon, mix to combine, adding flour or water as needed to form a soft dough. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough, adding flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the surface, until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. The dough should jump back when pressed with a fingertip. Form the dough into a ball. Lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, turn to coat with the oil, cover tightly with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours (the dough will rise more slowly in a cold room).

Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough briefly. Form the dough into a ball, return it to the bowl, cover and set aside to rise a third time for 45 minutes.

Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal.

To shape the dough, roll it into an 8-inch ball or 2 smaller balls and place the dough on the cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet. Cover with a large inverted bowl or plastic wrap that has been oiled. Set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 60 to 75 minutes.

A little more than halfway through the final rising, adjust the oven rack to the lowest position. Place a second baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 450 F.

When the dough has risen, using a sharp knife, slash the top of the loaf twice in 1 direction about 6 inches apart, then slice again with 2 slashes perpendicular to the first set.

Carefully slide the dough directly onto the preheated baking sheet and bake the bread for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 400 F and continue to bake for 50 to 65 minutes (34 to 40 minutes for the 2 small breads), until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when lightly tapped.

Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool slightly. Baked bread stays warm for 2 hours after baking.

* Note: Barley malt, also known as diastatic malt powder, is available locally at many grocery stores or by mail order from King Arthur's Flour (call 800-827-6836 or see www.kingarthurflour.com). Deli rye flavor and citric acid (or "sour salt") is also available from King Arthur's Flour. Citric acid is available at some grocery stores.

                        etc.

I make all kinds of pizza doughs. This particular dough has a crunchy outside and softer breadier inside. The white cornmeal adds a nice texture.
You can make the dough in bread machine using the dough cycle ( adding either water or flour if needed to get to the correct machine consistency- or to make by hand: also adding adequate flour or water for a nice pliable dough consistency to which you would knead, let rise double and punch down and use ( or refrigerate in a plastic bag till later ). etc.

Roll dough into a large circle ( so to either fit a 12 to 14 inch pizza pan or oven stone ). I do bake this on a 13 inch round pizza oven stone. I tuck the edges over ( not under ) into the dough for a rustic border. I then place on the sauce evenly. Then I sprinkle with pizza spices and garlic. Lastly I add the pepperoni, grated cheese and anchovies. There is no set rule how you can organize your pizza. This is then placed in a middle oven shelf of a preheated 450F oven and takes 25 to 30 minutes under the dough is golden and ingredients browned. This simply slides off my well conditioned stone ( for new stones you may want to sprinkle with a bit of cornmeal before placing on the dough ). I wait about 5 minutes before slicing the pizza. I slice it into 8 pieces.

NOTES : My husband and I use a lot of soy products for health related reasons.. I just made the following pizza using Yves Veggie Cuisine ( non gmo soy protein ) brand "pepperoni" which was the first time I ever tried soy pepperoni. . The dough recipe is mine but the soy pepperoni made the pizza taste especially wonderful. My husband insisted I share this!

                Daily Bread Mailing List        Hand Made
                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  Unbleached A/P Flour
                        -- (King Arthur recommends theirs)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Instant Yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  water

Manual Method: In a large bowl, or the bowl of your electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients, stirring till the dough forms a cohesive mass and begins to clear the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, then allow it to rest for 10 minutes (which gives the dough a chance to absorb the liquid, and the gluten in the flour a chance to relax) Knead the dough for an additional 5 minutes, or until it's smooth and supple. The dough should be quite stiff, but not at all "gnarly"; adjust its consistency with additional flour or water, as necessary. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise till it's noticeably puffy, about 1 hour.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for manual or dough, and press start. About 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, examine the dough's consistency; it should be quite stiff, but not at all "gnarly"; adjust it's consistency with additional flour or water as necessary. Allow the machine to complete it's cycle.

Shaping: Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and divide it into six equal pieces. Shape the pieces into round balls, and place them on a lightly greased parchment-lined baking sheet. Working with one ball of dough at a time, center your kaiser stamp over the dough. Press down firmly, cuting to the bottom but not all the way through the dough. This is important; if you don't cut deeply enough, the shape will disappear as the roll bakes; if you cut too deeply (all the way through) the roll will form "petals" as it rises and look like a daisy, not a kaiser roll. Practice makes perfect! Repeat with the remaining rolls.

Place the rolls cut side down. (yes, cut-side down - this helps them retain their shape) onto a lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Cover the rolls, and allow them to rise for 45 minutes to one hour, or until they're almost doubled in volume. Turn the rolls cut side up. Dip the tops in milk and coat with poppy or sesame seeds, if desired.

Bake the rolls in a preheated oven for 15 to 17 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a wire rack. Yield 6 large kaiser rolls.

                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        The Sponge
  1 1/2            tsp  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  2                tsp  sugar
     1/2           tsp  malt extract or honey
     1/2           cup  milk -- scalded and allowed
                        to cool to warm
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cool water
                        ---
                        The Dough
  1 1/2            tsp  salt
  1                cup  all purpose flour
                        -- + extra flour as required
                        all of the sponge
                        poppy seeds or other toppings

The Sponge:
Proof the yeast in the warm water; dissolve the sugar and malt extract in
the warm milk.  Mix yeast mixture, milk mixture and flour and cool water
together until smooth.  Set covered in warm place for 2 hours.

The Dough:
Mix salt with flour and add to the sponge by handfuls while mixing. Hold back 1/4 cup flour for kneading. Mix for 10 minutes; then knead on a board with remaining flour until soft and satiny in texture. It may take up to 1/2 cup more flour to get proper texture. (It has been my experience that without the extra flour the dough is too wet to be shaped later.) Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled.

Divide dough into 6 pieces, roll each piece into a tight ball and let rest, covered, for 15 minutes. One at time, flatten each ball into a disk and fold into the classic "petal" or "pinwheel" pattern. Hold the disk in the center with one thumb, grab the outer edge between the thumb and index fingers of the other hand and pull outward slightly, then fold over the disk to the middle and hold the folded piece down with the thumb. Seal the fold with heel of the free hand. Rotate the disk 90F and stretch and fold again, capturing the fold under the thumb. Keep going around 4 or 5 times total until the top of the roll looks like a pinwheel.

Place each folded roll on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave plenty of room for rolls to expand in diameter. Brush with vegetable oil and cover with another sheet of parchment paper, then another cookie sheet, then a cast iron skillet. Let rise (actually expand in diameter) for 35 to 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 450F.

Remove skillet and top layer of parchment paper and spray rolls with water; then sprinkle on toppings. Use water spray in oven before and during baking (or uses whatever steam method you use to create crusty breads). Bake for 20 minutes.

(I've tried this recipe several times and each time the rolls come out dense, almost bagel-like. NY Hard Rolls should be light in texture with a chewy crust and should pull apart in sections formed by the petals. Even with relatively stiff dough the folded detail is lost during final rise under the weight.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 2 Lb Loaf: -- (1 1/2 Lb Loaf):
  1 1/4           cups  Water -- (1 C + 2 Tbsp)
  3               Tbsp  Oil -- (2 Tbsp)
  2 1/8           Tbsp  Salt -- Note 1
  4               Tbsp  Brown Sugar -- (3 Tbsp.)
  3               Tbsp  Dry Milk Powder -- (2 Tbsp)
                        (I Omitted Dry Milk Powder)
  3 1/3           cups  Whole Wheat Bread Flour -- Note 2
  1               cups  White Bread Flour
  4                Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- Note 3

Note 1: Original recipe used 2 tsp salt for 2 lb loaf and 1 1/2 tsp salt for 1 1/2 lb loaf. Note 2: Original recipe used 4 1/3 C whole wheat flour for 2 lb loaf and 3 1/4 C whole wheat bread flour for the original Whole Wheat Bread. There is a note that appears in the recipe that states "For best results, when not using Bread Flour, we recommend adding Gluten to the recipe. Add 1/3 C of Gluten to a 2 lb recipe. If whole wheat flour is stone ground, you may need to add 1/2 C of Gluten, or more" Note 3: Original recipe used 4 1/2 tsp active dry yeast for 2 lb loaf and 1 1/4 tsp for 1 1/2 lb loaf.

Put all ingredients into the baking pan of your machine according to your particular bread machine manufacturer's instructions. Push "Start" (and I used light crust setting).

This was a very nicely textured, flavored and aromatic loaf of bread. The rise was perfect.

NOTES : The next day we use the 2 lb Whole Wheat Bread basic recipe but I decide to
make it a light ww bread.  I made it and it was excellent!!  I used 3 1/3 C
whole wheat bread flour and 1 C white bread flour, (I have never had any
luck using gluten).  This was a very good loaf of bread but it needed more
salt.  Made it again and used 2 1/8 tsp salt and it was perfect.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            Tsp  yeast
  2 1/2           Cups  all-purpose flour
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  3        Tablespoons  sugar
  3        Tablespoons  almond paste
                        finely grated rind of two oranges
     1/2         Stick  butter -- (2 ounces), melted
  1              Large  egg
  4        Tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
     3/4           Cup  water
     1/2           Cup  pecans -- (3 ounces)
                        To Complete:
     1/2         Stick  Sweet Butter -- Melted
     1/2          cups  Confectioner's Sugar -- For Dusting

Place all the ingredients except the pecans in the machine. Program for dough, adding the pecans at the very end of the final knead cycle.

To complete:
1/2 stick (2 ounces) sweet butter, melted 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, for dusting

At the end of the final rise, punch down the dough and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 14" long oval. Brush the surface of the dough with some of the melted butter and fold it in half, lengthwise. Press lightly on the fold of the dough, pressing toward the open edges. Do not press the outer edges together. Transfer the shaped dough to a greased and floured baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 30-40 minutes or until double in bulk.

Preheat the oven to 375F with the rack in the center position. Bake the stollen for 30-35 minutes or until lightly brown. Remove from the oven and immediately brush with the remaining melted butter and then dust generously with the confectioners sugar.

You can make the dough in a (large) bread machine, in the food processor or in the mixer (and of course by hand...)

This is a wonderful tasting bread. I used the dough cycle on my new Breadman and it turned out wonderful!!

                Sweet Breads & Cakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2               tsp.  baking powder
     1/2          tsp.  salt
  1              cups.  choppped pecans
  1              cups.  vegetable oil
  1              cups.  sugar
  3                     extra large eggs
     3/4         cups.  mini chocolate chips -- (optional)
                        Cinnamon-sugar mix for top

The Jewish version of biscotti is called mandelbrodt, and the process is the same...twice baked. My grandmother used to make it all the time, but once ran out of almonds and used pecans instead. The taste and texture were wonderful! The pecans made the finished product a bit softer. I now make it with pecans all the time.


Heat oven to 350 F. Grease two baking sheets. Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pecans in medium bowl. (I use a plastic bag--no bowl to wash). In large mixer bowl beat oil, sugar and eggs for 2 minutes. Add flour mixture and beat till well combined. Fold in chocolate chips if using.

Divide dough into quarters and place 2 pieces on each baking sheet. Rub your hands on the baking sheet so dough won't stick to them and form each piece into a flat loaf, about 1 1/2 inches wide and 3/4 inch high (length doesn't matter). Sprinkle generously with cinnamon-sugar. Bake 20 - 25 min. or till dough feels fairly firm when pressed lightly in the center. Remove from oven.

Slice each loaf diagonally in 3/4 inch slices and turn each slice cut side up. Return to oven for about 15 min. more.

NOTES : My wife and I are getting together with children and grandchildren at my eldest son's home for Thanksgiving and I have been "instructed" to bring the bread. My eldest daughter said, "Make it Monti's Roman bread, dad." This is my adaptation of a recipe that I found some years ago. It came from Monti's La Casa Vieja in Tempe, Arizona. The owner, Leonard Monti, said his parents brought this recipe from Italy nearly 60 years ago. So, here it is; my Thanksgiving gift to all of you...

                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg -- plus
  1              large  egg white
  1                cup  milk
                        ---
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  water or milk
                        ---
  3               cups  unbleached white flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        ---
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter
                        ---
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  broken walnuts or pecans

1. Preheat your oven to 450 F. Organize all the ingredients and supplies.

2. Cover a thick baking sheet with butter or parchment paper.

3. Beat a large egg plus the white of a second egg in a small bowl, then beat in 1C milk. Refrigerate this blend.

4. Stir the second yolk in a dish with 1T of water or milk, for the egg wash. Set this dish aside at room temperature.

5. In a large bowl, "lift and sift" together: 3C "loose and level" organic unbleached white flour, 1T sugar, 4t level baking powder, and 1t salt.

5. Cut one stick of cold unsalted butter into many small pieces.

6. Using a fork or pasty blender, work the butter pieces into the flour mixture. Small lumps and blobs are okay.

7. Stir 1/2C raisins and 1/2C broken walnuts or pecans into the flour-butter mixture, using the "fast hands" technique. (Other dried fruit and nuts are okay, if desired.)

8. Pour and lightly stir the egg-milk mixture into the "well-well-well" flour-butter mixture. Stop! You're over-stirring!

9. Spread a handful of flour on the counter, and dump the shaggy blob of batter over the flour.

10. Quickly knead the loose batter a few times. Stop! That's enough! Your dough is supposed to be sticky. Pat the dough mass into a rough circle.

11. Rapidly cut the dough into 12-15 well-spaced approximately 2" half-scone-sized pieces, and place them on the baking sheet. Your hands are now very sticky.

12. Quickly and lightly dab each piece with some of the egg wash.

13. Place the full baking sheet in your oven, and turn down the temperature to 400 F.

14. Set your timer for 10 minutes. The total baking time will be 10-14 minutes.

15. Start watching for the bottoms of the scones to be firm and light golden brown. (Keep baking in 1-minute intervals if necessary.) It's much better to underbake them. (After a few times you will be able to know when they are just right.)

16. Cool the baked scones on a wire rack.

17. It's okay to eat them all the same day, because you can always make more tomorrow.

18. Let the scones cool for two hours, store them (not a chance!) in a Ziploc bag at room temperature. Better idea: eat them right away with appreciative family/friends, and make some more.

UTENSILS: measuring cups, measuring spoons, stirring spoon, spatula, mixing bowls, egg beater, towels, plastic wrap, baking sheet, cutting board, cooling rack, timer, scraper, sponge, scrub pad, pastry brush, thermometer, oven mitts, knife.

INGREDIENTS: butter, eggs, milk, water, organic unbleached white flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, raisins, walnuts.

HELPFUL HINTS:

BAKING (Too long makes scones dry; watch the bottoms brown)

DOUGH (Too sticky is better than too stiff)

EATING (Too soon after baking gives you indigestion)

KNEADING (You don't need much at all with scone batter)

BUTTER (Too much is better than too little)

PRE-HEATING (Too long or hot is better than too short or cool)

SALT (Too little is better than too much)

TEFLON BAKING SHEET (Buy one! Heavy is better than light)

SUGAR (Too little is better than too much)

MILK (Cool is best with this recipe)

TEMPERATURES (You want everything to be cold)

                          Peach-Raisin Jam <R T>

Recipe By     :Breadman
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Peaches -- Note 1
  1 1/4           cups  White Sugar -- Plus
  3               Tbsp  White Sugar
  2               Tbsp  Golden Raisins -- Note 2
  1               Tbsp  Brown Sugar
  2                     Whole Cloves
     1/8           Tsp  Ground Allspice

First I decided to make jam. Well, I chose the recipe from their book for Peach-Raisin Jam. I had never made jam in my Zo because I had a friend (locally) who made some type of jam in her Zo (like mine) and it ruined the finish on the baking pan. I was a bit leary of starting right off trying this but decided to jump in and give it a test. So I gathered the ingredients (recipes all included with this posting). I read the recipe and it said "Place all ingredients in Baking Pan and start the Jam cycle." So I decide that 1 1/2 hrs just couldn't be enough time to mash up the peaches so I cut them into 3rds. Put all the ingredients into the baking pan and started the jam cycle. Well, 1 1/2 hrs later I took out the pan and poured the jam into the cleaned jar. I figured that it would jell when it got cold. Well, it did and tasted wonderful!! If it is left out for any length of time (since there is no pectin added) it gets a little runny but the flavor is wonderful. But the chunks of peaches were still the same as when I put them into the pan. So I looked thru the book and found the half page of jam making instructions and it says for best results "to crush with a potato masher or food processor but not to puree the fruit. Jam is supposed to have some bits of fruit in it".

Then I decide since we have all this jam we will use it before I make some more ... we are pretty slow using jams and jellies.


Note 1: Original recipe stated to use ripe, pitted peaches. I used frozen without sugar added peaches that I defrosted and drained off any water. Note 2: Original recipe stated that the golden raisins were supposed to be soaked but it didn't state what to soak them in or how long. I soaked them in 1/4 C Chardonnay for about 10 min then drained off the extra Chardonnay.

With Kneading Blade in position, add the crushed fruit to the Baking Pan.

Add the rest of the called for ingredients.

Insert Baking Pan into the Breadman.

Close Lid

Press "Select" button until Jam cycle is chosen.

Press "Start"

The Breadman will pre-heat for 10 min before any movement occurs in the pan. After pre-heating, the jam will be heated and mixed for approx 60 min. The entire cycle take 1:20 min in which 10 min is the cool-down cycle.

The Breadman will beep when the cycle is complete.

Press "Reset" and remove the Pan, MAKING SURE TO WEAR OVEN MITTS.

Pour the hot jam into a refrigerator/freezer-safe container, leaving 1/2" of space at the top.

Cover tightly to store.

Jam will thicken upon cooling and storage.

Note: Fruit and sugar should be weighed on a small kitchen or postal scale. 1 1/2 C of fruit or white sugar weighs 12 oz.

For Best Results:
Do not reduce sugar or use sugar substitutes. The exact amounts of sugar, fruit, and pectin are necessary for a good set.

Use only ripe fruit (not overripe or underripe) for best flavor.

Do not puree fruit. Crush with a potato masher or food processor. Jam should have bits of fruit in it.

Recipes should not exceed 3 1/2 C

Be sure to measure fruit after it has been crushed, not before.

Remove stems, seeds or pits from fruit before crushing.

This is very, very good!! Quite tasty and very easy to make.

                Sweet Breads & Cakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  All-Purpose Flour
  1                Tsp  Baking Powder
     1/2           Tsp  Baking Soda
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
     3/4          cups  White Sugar
  2                 Lg  Eggs
     1/2          cups  Skim Milk -- Note 1
     1/2          cups  Canned Pineapple Chunks In Juice -- Drained
     1/4          cups  Pineapple Juice -- From Can
     1/2          cups  Sweetened Coconut Flakes
  1                Tsp  Vanilla Extract

Note 1: Original recipe used whole milk

Combine first four ingredients and mix well. Set aside.

Place pineapple, pineapple juice, eggs, milk, coconut, sugar, and vanilla in the Baking Pan and place it in the machine. Close the Lid and start the cake cycle. When continuous mixing begins, add the flour mixture in a slow, steady stream. Close the Lid.

Allow the cake to cool uncovered in the refrigerator for 25 - 30 min before attempting to remove it from the pan.

This tastes very good. Extremely easy to prepare with not a lot of extra pans to clean up.

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Hand Made
                Pizza & Calzones                White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3         cups.  warm water
  1 1/2           tsp.  yeast -- dry or fresh
     3/4          tsp.  salt
  2               cups  bread flour
                        -- (I use King Arthur)
  3               Tbs.  Extra virgin olive oil

Sprinkle dry yeast over the surface of the warm water, or crumble the fresh yeast into the water. Let it sit for 3 or 4 minutes and then gently whisk the water around to mix the yeast. Add the olive oil.

Add the flour, mix with the liquid and start kneading. (Carlo's recipe adds the salt to the yeast before adding the flour.I always add the salt after part of the flour is incorporated, as I have read that adding the salt too soon can affect the gluten.)

If using an electric mixer, knead on medium speed for about 7 minutes. Knead by hand for about 15 minutes. Even if the dough is very sticky, do not add flour until you are convinced that further kneading and contact with air will not dry it out.

When the dough is well kneaded, put the dough into a clean bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. (I use a large plastic dough bucket with a lid.any container will work, but it should be covered. Plastic wrap is fine.) Proof for about 2 hours in a warm place (about 80 F). The dough should be at least twice the original volume. Deflate it, put the cover back on, and let rise again for another 2 to 3 hours. The longer and slower the proofing, the better the bread will taste. (You can also mix the dough and rise in the refrigerator overnight.) The dough is now ready to make pizza. When I am making multiple pizzas, I store the portions in a ziploc bag that contains a small amount of olive oil. Many times, I will make the dough in the AM and keep the dough portions in these bags until I am ready to use them for dinner. I use a pizza stone that has been preheated at least 30 minutes and bake the pizzas at 500 F. (Occasionally I use a gas grill.)

Note: When I make pizzas I usually triple this recipe. You then have several options. You can prepare the dough and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. I usually get 6 smaller pizzas form a triple batch. Many times, I let the dough rise twice and then divide into 6 portions which I then wrap loosely in plastic wrap, place in a Ziploc freezer bag and place in the freezer. You can defrost overnight in the refrigerator for use the next day, or you can defrost for a few hours at room temp. It is a quick way to have dough ready at short notice

You can use this recipe, omitting the olive oil to make Italian style bread. After the second rising, shape the dough into a round loaf. You can use a floured piece of parchment to raise the dough on. Let rise, covered with a floured kitchen towel until plump. This will take about an hour, depending on the temperature of your kitchen. Use a preheated 475 F oven. Slash the top with a razor. Place onto the stone. For a loaf with a thick crust, put a shallow pan of hot water in the oven at the same time bread. Leave it there for the entire baking time. After 10 minutes at 475 F, reduce temp to 400 F and continue baking for about 40 min. To test for doneness, knock it on the bottom. It should sound hollow and be golden in color.

                        instant
  2               cups  flour -- all purpose
     1/2           cup  polenta or coarse ground cornmmeal
     1/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  fresh herbs such as rosemary -- *see Note
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- extra virgin
                        preferred
  1           teaspoon  salt -- kosher preferred

In a food processors or bread machine on dough cycle, measure liquids and herbs into the bowl. add the dry incgedients and knead to provide a smooth ball with bits of corn meal on the surface. I find that the dough needs to be on the soft side as the corn meal adsorbs water as the dough rises.

Food processor-- after kneading to form a ball, allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 hours to double in size.

This dough will improve in flavor if stored under refrigeration for a day or two.

NOTES : Here is a polenta pizza dough that works well --

I grind my own cornmeal and sieve out the fine parts to get the larger polenta pieces with corn bran. Bobs Red Mill provides a good polenta corn on the west coast. I have used grits also.

Maximum corn pizza is to make polenta and spread it on a oiled pizza pan. Allow to cool and set up. Bake the polenta in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes and add toppings. Continue to bake for an additional 15 minutes to melt cheese and heat toppings.

  3 1/4           cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry yeast

This was passed to me through many hands. It appears to have originated from Molly in Montana. It's not our style, so I have not tried it, but it comes highly recommended.

Place all ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order given. Set machine for white bread cycle, 1 1/2# loaf size and light crust.

You can use honey instead of sugar, just put it in with the moist ingredients instead of with the flour. The original recipe called for only 3 c. of flour, Molly said she added 1/2 cup more, but I have found that for me and my machine, an extra 1/4 cup is just right. Plan to check once the dough forms a ball and if it is too sticky, you can add more about 1 T. at a time.

NOTE: The recipe calls for Potato Flakes, but I used a small boiled potato. Do not use a large potato, because the the bread crumb will be gummy. Potatoes act the same as Bread Softeners used by Commercial Bakeries. It is an anti-staling ingredient, plus it has many other benefits in dough fermentation. The following information was copied and pasted from Willie Prejean's Baking and Baking Science web site:

Potatoes contain a large percentage of carbohydrates occurring in the form of gelatinized starch. This gelatinized starch is readily converted to maltose sugar by the flour enzyme Diastase (Alpha Amalyse and Beta Amalyse). This is the reason why potatoes speed up the fermentation process. Potatoes also contain growth promoting mineral substances which stimulate yeast development. Emulsifiers ( bread softeners) are not needed because potatoes function as stale retarding agents which helps to reduce the rate at which the bread crumb becomes firm.

     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  water
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  FLEISCHMANN'S Bread Machine Yeast
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  SPICE ISLANDS Ground Cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- melted

Add milk, water, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, salt, bread flour, 4 teaspoons sugar, and yeast to bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough/manual cycle.

When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine to a lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle. Divide dough into 20 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball. Stir together the 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon. Dip each ball into the 2 tablespoons melted butter; roll each ball in sugar mixture. Arrange half of the coated balls in the bottom of a greased 6 1/2- to 8-cup ovenproof ring mold or fluted tube pan with nonremovable bottom. Make a second layer, positioning the balls for the second layer between the balls in the first layer.

Drizzle balls with any remaining melted butter and sprinkle with any remaining sugar mixture. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes. Bake at 375oF for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Cool 1 minute on a wire rack. Invert onto a serving plate; remove ring mold or pan. Serve warm. Makes 20 rolls. Cycle: Dough/manual cycle.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  All-Purpose Flour
  1                Tsp  Baking Powder
     1/4           Tsp  Baking Soda
     1/4           Tsp  Ground Nutmeg
     1/8           Tsp  Salt
     3/4          cups  Canned Pumpkin
  3               Tbsp  Cooking Oil

  2                Tsp  Granulated Sugar
     1/4           Tsp  Ground Cinnamon

The flavor of these biscuit-like rolls will remind you of pumpkin pie.

In a medium mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt. In a small mixing bowl combine the pumpkin, oil, and brown sugar. Add pumpkin mixture to dry mixture, stirring with a fork until combined. Form into a ball. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough gently for 10 to 12 strokes. Divide dough in half. Roll each half to a 10-inch circle. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. To shape, begin at the wide end of each wedge and loosely roll toward the point. Place point sides down, about 2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Curve ends of rolls slightly. Combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over crescents. Bake in a 400F. oven for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Makes 16 rolls.

Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare, bake, and cool rolls. Freeze in a freezer container or bag up to 1 month. Wrap frozen rolls in foil and thaw at room temperature for 2 hours; reheat in a 375F. oven for 3 to 5 minutes.

Test Kitchen: An Old Pro Learns Some New Tricks By FLORENCE FABRICANT
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/11/living/11KITC.html

HE Cuisinart's profile, so familiar for more than 25 years, has had a curvaceous makeover. The latest model, the PowerPrep Plus, has a sleek white rounded base instead of an angular one. Also new are touch-pad buttons, which replace levers, and a work bowl made of clear, not smoky, plastic. The feed tube, originally in the front, is there again.

But this new machine is not just comelier. A new setting has been added, for mixing and kneading yeast doughs, and a reconfigured stainless-steel dough blade has replaced the barely adequate plastic one.

Over the years, there have been subtle changes in the machine, which was introduced in 1973. Machine capacity grew from 7 cups to 14, the feed tube was moved to the back on many models, the motor was strengthened and the pulse button was added. But this is the first time a new feature has been incorporated into a total redesign.

So, do I spend more than $300 on the new model and wind up with two food processors, or consign my reliable DLC-7 Super Pro to a thrift shop? (It would be nice if I could trade it in, like a used car.)

As a baker, I would probably spring for the PowerPrep Plus. While the new machine performs much the same as my 15- year-old one, the added dough setting and the curved but blunt metal dough blade are most effective. I tried a heavy yeast bread recipe, one calling for six cups of flour, and the blade and setting handled it beautifully, kneading the dough in 45 seconds.

"We wanted to refine the machine for the high-end user, for hobbyist cooks," said Kerry Cooper, the senior marketing manager for food processors at Cuisinart, which has its headquarters in Stamford, Conn. "We worked with Charles van Over to engineer the dough setting and the blade."

Mr. van Over is the author of "The Best Bread Ever" (Broadway Books, 1997), which outlined the connection between temperature, time and oxidation in bread baking. Mr. van Over came up with virtually foolproof food processor methods. Some of his recipes are in the instruction booklet.

With the new dough setting, dough is mixed and kneaded at 1,350 r.p.m.'s instead of 1,750 at the regular setting. At the slower speed there is less aeration, Mr. Cooper said, "so you get a better mix and your dough is much more tolerant if you happen to use a little too much liquid."

Because the work bowl capacity and the blade housing are the same in the new model and in my old machine, I tried mixing the six-cup bread recipe in the old model, using the new dough blade. The machine struggled. I finished the recipe in the new machine. A pizza recipe using just three cups of flour came out about as fine using the new dough blade in my old machine as in the new one.

I also found that walnuts pulsed with the regular metal knife blade on the slower dough setting came out more evenly chopped than they did on the regular, faster speed; another bonus for a baker.

The Cuisinart PowerPrep Plus, with a suggested retail price of $425, is sold in many housewares stores for around $325. The dough blade, which comes with the machine, can be bought separately for $30.

  2        Tablespoons  dry milk
  2        Tablespoons  Active Dry Yeast Yeast

2 Cups boiling water
6 Tablespoons Salt-Rising Yeast
4 Tablespoons nonfat dry milk

Pour the boiling water into small bowl
Sprinkle the Salt-Rising Yeast and dry milk in water and stir until well mixed
Stir again in few minutes until thickened.
Cover and place in warm place (100 to 105 degrees F. for 12 to 24 hours.

NOTE: A BETTER TASTING LOAF CAN BE MADE BY LETTING IT FERMENT FOR 38 TO 48 HOURS INSTEAD OF 12 TO 24 HOURS.

4 Cups Bread Flour
2 Cups hot water

Procedure:
Add flour and hot water  to starter and ferment for 2 to 4 hours or longer in a warm place.  It's O.K. to let set overnight if you want a stronger cheesy flavor.

1 Cup warm water
8 Cups Bread Flour
6 Tablespoons sugar
2 Tablespoons salt
1/2 Cup shortening
2 Tablespoons dry milk
2 Tablespoons Active Dry Yeast Yeast

Procedure:
Add the dry milk, yeast, warm water, flour, salt , sugar and shorening. Mix until gluten is properly developed.

Divide dough into individual size loaves and proof 2 to 4 hours in a warm place.
Bake at 350-400 degrees F. until golden brown and bottom sounds hollow when thumped. Note: Loaf may not double in size during proof. This type of bread does not reach full volume and the interior is close grained. The bread has a very strong cheesy flavor and the odor can be smelled throughout the house.

                        Unsalted Butter Or Corn Oil -- Note 1

Reprinted with permission of Simon and Schuster Inc., New York, New York. "I love the smell of corn bread hot out of the oven. It's my idea of what a home kitchen ought to smell like. Skillet corn bread takes only five minutes to mix and twenty minutes to bake, and it costs less than a dollar for a thick eight-inch round - a good deal, no matter how you slice it." An 8- or 9-inch round cake pan, well greased, can be substituted for the skillet. The timing is about the same, but the corn bread will not be as crisp or browned on the bottom and sides.

For equipment, you will need a large mixing bowl, a wire whisk, a rubber spatula, and a well-seasoned 8-to 9-inch cast-iron skillet.

Note 1: (3 tablespoons for thebatter, 1 tablespoon for the skillet)

1. Preheat the oven to 425F.

2. Combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a large mixing bowl and whisk together to mix well. Add the eggs and milk and mix until you have a smooth batter.

3. Heat an 8- to 9-inch cast-iron skillet over low heat and add the bacon fat or butter. (If you are using corn oil, just add 3 tablespoons directly to the batter.) When the fat is melted, pour 3 tablespoons into the corn bread batter and mix well. Leave the remaining 1 tablespoon of fat in the skillet and turn the heat up to medium-high. When the pan is hot (but not scorching hot), scrape in the batter; you will hear it sizzle. Immediately place the skillet in the
oven and bake for about 20 minutes, until the corn bread is golden brown on top.To test, stick a skewer into the center of the corn bread; if it comes out clean, the bread is done. Use a spatula to remove the corn bread to a wire rack and let it cool for 10 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve warm.

  2                tsp  ground cloves
     1/2           cup  sugar

Mix flour, salt, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, mustard, pepper, cloves and sugar. Stir in finely minced ginger. Add mixed eggs and honey anbd stir into dry ingredients along with almonds. The final mix should be quite thick. If it is not, then cooking time increases and the ginger dries out. Put about 20" saran on table and put one half of the dough in here. Fold saran and press to shape dough into rectangle about one half inch thick. Do the same with other half and then put these two in freezer for three or more hours. Remove from freezer, remove saran and put on pam'ed cookie sheet, cooking at 300F for 50 minutes. Take out of oven and slice on diagonal - about 1/2" thick slices. Put them back on cookie sheet and bake at 275F, turning every 15-20 minutes until brown and fairly dry. Check every 15-20 minutes. Put on rack to cook. Store so that they stay dry (zip lock bag) and watch out for your teeth. They are meant for dunking in your coffee or tea.

NOTES : These are mainly whole almonds, but I imagine that almond paste would be substituted. The only one of these I have tried is the first and they can have a good bite to them. Sounds wierd, but folks seem to become addicted to them i.e. my kids. Give them a try - but watch your teeth - they are hard but very tasty. I make enough of them to make my own crystallized ginger.

Add 2 cups bread flour; beat until smooth. Stir in yeast mixture. Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time until dough holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Transfer dough to lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to large greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down. Let rest for 5 minues. Grease two 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4-inch loaf pans. Divide dough in half; lightly coat halves with flour. Gently pat each half into 7 x 5 inch rectangle. Transfer to the 2 prepared loaf pans. Cover with clean kitchen towel. Let rise in warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/4 hours.

Heat oven to 350 degrees. With a razor blade or very sharp knife, make a slash down length of each loaf.

Bake in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Open oven; pull rack with breads out slightly. Brush loaves with some of the melted butter. Bake another 15 minutes. Brush again with butter. Bake another 5 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove loaves from pans to wire to cool.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          envelopes  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water (110 to 115F.)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        ---
  1                cup  scalded milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  soft butter or margarine -- (1 stick)
  2              large  eggs
  6               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground nutmeg
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon rind
  1 1/2           cups  seedless raisins
  1 1/3           cups  chopped almonds
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- (1/2 stick) melted
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2               cups  sifted confectioners' sugar
  3        tablespoons  water

Place the first 3 ingredients in a mixing bowl large enough for mixing the dough. Let stand until yeast softens. Cool milk to lukewarm and add to yeast along with the 1/2 cup sugar and butter or margarine. Mix well. Beat in eggs. Stir in 3 cups of the flour, together with the salt, nutmeg, and lemon rind. Beat until batter drops in sheets from the spoon. Stir in remaining flour, raisins, and 1 cup of the almonds. Turn onto a lightly floured board. Knead until dough is smooth and satiny. Put dough into a greased bowl, turning to bring the greased side to the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (80 to 85F.) 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. Punch down dough. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

Divide the dough in half. Roll each half into a rectangular sheet 1/2 inch thick and about 12 inches long. Brush each with melted butter or margarine. Mix the 1/4 cup sugar with the cinnamon and sprinkle it, together with the remaining almonds, over the dough. Fold sides of each piece of dough to the middle and stretch to make long loaves, thick at the middle, narrow at the ends. Place each on a greased baking sheet. Brush tops with melted butter or margarine. Cover and let rise in a warm place (80 to 85F.) 45 minutes or until double in size.

Bake in a preheated moderate oven (375F.) 20 minutes or until browned. Combine confectioners' sugar and water and spread over top of the warm loaves when they are placed on wire racks to cool.

                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  high-gluten bread flour
  3        tablespoons  coarse cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  rolled oats
                        -- (or instant oats)
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  wheat bran
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        -- (I use sea salt)
  1         tablespoon  instant yeast
                        -- (or 1-1/4 tablespoons active dry yeast
                        -- dissolved in 4 tablespoons warm water)
  3        tablespoons  cooked brown rice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  honey
     1/3           cup  buttermilk
                        -- (low-fat or whole milk can be
                        substituted)
     3/4           cup  water -- at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  poppy seeds -- for the topping

In a large bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, oats, sugar, wheat bran, salt, and yeast, stirring to distribute. Add the cooked rice, honey, and buttermilk; mix. Add 1/2 cup water, reserving the rest for adjustments during kneading.

Using your hands, squeeze the ingredients together until they make a ball. Add more water as needed until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated into the dough ball. Sprinkle some flour on your clean work surface and turn the ball out of the bowl. Begin kneading. Add additional water or flour as needed.

It will take about 10 to 15 minutes to knead by hand. The dough will change before your eyes, lightening in color, gradually becoming more elastic and evenly grained. The finished dough should be tacky but not sticky, lightly golden, stretchy and elastic. When you push the heels of your hands into the dough, it should give way but not tear. If it flakes or crumbles, add a little more water; if it is sticky, sprinkle in more flour.

Wipe the inside of a clean mixing bowl with a little oil, or mist with a vegetable-oil pan spray (I use canola oil). Place the dough in the bowl and over with a damp towel or plastic-wrap (I prefer a damp towel as I believe it allows the dough to "breathe."), or place the bowl in a plastic bag. Allow the dough to ferment in a warm place for about 90 minutes, or until it has roughly doubled in size.

Shape the dough into a loaf by pressing it out from the center with the heels of your hands, gently flattening it into a rough rectangle and punching it down, degassing it. Then roll the dough up into the shape of a cigar. Pinch the seam closed with either your fingers or the edge of your hand, sealing it as best you can.

Place the loaf, seam side down, in a greased (I use the canola oil mister) 9-by-4-inch pan. Spray the top with water and sprinkle on the poppy seeds (I gently press them into the dough - that's gently). Cover and allow the dough to rise until it crests over the top of the pan, about 90 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the loaf for approximately 45 to 55 minutes. The loaf should dome nicely and be dark golden in color. The sides and bottom should be a uniform light golden brown. Brother Peter is a "thwacker" but I use an instant-read thermometer to make sure that the interior of the loaf has reached at least 190 degrees.

Allow the bread to cool thoroughly on a rack at least 40 minutes before slicing it.

This bread is fantastic for both toast and sandwiches. Brother Peter says, "There is something almost magical about how the flavor of mayonnaise marries with the light sweetness of the loaf."

NOTES : This recipe was recently printed in my local newspaper. I was pleased to see it as it is one of Brother Peter Reinhart's recipes, and he is one of my "baking heroes." I had first read of Struan bread in his book, "Brother Juniper's Bread Book." The book recipe makes four loaves and this one makes one loaf, however, I adapted it to make two loaves as I knew just one wouldn't last very long around here. So, let's go...

 Jewis Rye Bread, Levy's Real
 Bagels, Part 1 and Bagels, Part 2

The Way They Were

By Rose Levy Beranbaum
Special to The Washington Post
Wednesday, November 8, 2000

My first bread memory and my first teething ring are one and the same: the beloved bagel. My mother, who was a dentist, considered it the ideal natural teething ring because of its firm yet forgiving texture. But it was my father who brought home the bagels on a string every Friday afternoon after he made his weekly delivery of peels. A peel is a flat wooden tray with a long handle, designed for transferring bread to the oven. Peels for bagels are only slightly wider than the bagel itself. The bagels, after being boiled in salted water, are lined up on this piece of wood, that has been lightly sprinkled with cornmeal, and thrust from it directly onto the hot oven shelf.

In the 1940s after the war and the early 1950s, when times were hard, my father, Robert Levy, a skilled cabinet-maker, turned to bagel peel production and laid claim to the exclusive bagel peel business in the greater New York area, which included the five boroughs and all of New Jersey. This did not make us rich, but we had all the bagels we could eat. Nowadays, bagel appreciation has permeated the world, but they are not the bagels of my childhood. Those were dense and chewy, plain golden brown--no poppy seeds, onion or "everything" and certainly no boutique blueberry bagels with the texture of cake. (The first time I heard about those I felt as if the world as I knew it was coming to an end.) My bagels were served cut in half vertically so that to my childish imagination they delightfully resembled telephone receivers, and each cut half was spread with a big lump of sweet butter. As I bit off each piece, a new lump of butter would be applied by my attentive grandmother.

When I got older, I ate bagels the way the grown-ups did, cutting them in half horizontally, digging out the soft centers and toasting them before filling the cavities thus created with butter.

I haven't had a bagel that has pleased me as much in all these years: The texture of bagels has become ever more compromised in the direction of an airy bread. I was afraid to make them myself because I somehow believed a homemade bagel could never come close to my memory. Happily, I was proven wrong by following the directions of a great baker, Lauren Groveman. Not only did the bagels match my memory, they exceeded it.

The other bread dear to my memory is Jewish rye. Since Levy's was the most popular brand and that was our family name, I always felt a special connection to it though the bread we ate was a less commercial variety produced by a small bakery in the Bronx. Both my parents were born and raised there, but when I was growing up, we lived in Manhattan. Whenever my father had an excuse to return to the Bronx, he never came home without a freshly baked loaf from his favorite bakery. Sometimes it was dense, moist corn bread, other times coarse pumpernickel, neither of which interested me. My choice was the rye bread, studded with constellations of caraway seeds. (I always complained when he brought home the seedless variety, which he would only do when they sold out of the caraway one.)

My grandmother, who lived with us, would serve it to me spread thickly with unsalted butter, the top paved with rounds of sliced red radishes, lightly sprinkled with kosher salt, crushed fine between her thumb and index finger. To this day it is my favorite way to eat rye bread, except that I now use fleur du sel instead of kosher salt.

It has taken me years to get my rye bread to taste and feel just right. I like a wheaty flavor with not so much rye that it becomes bitter and a chewy texture that is not so dense it becomes pasty. I love using La Cloche, a large, unglazed, earthenware platter with a dome-shaped top, in which to bake the bread. During baking, the bread rises to fill the dome, which gives it a lovely shape, moist texture and very crunchy crust. The bread is still delicious and beautiful when made free-form or in two half-size loaves.

I prefer making both the bagels and rye bread entirely by hand because half the pleasure lies in the feel of kneading the dough. But the quality will be equal if either is made with a heavy-duty electric mixer.

My husband enjoys the extra caraway-sour flavor provided by the small amount of rye flavor, which reminds him of the Jewish deli rye. Either way, this is a very satisfying bread.

If you believe in the value of anticipation, there is only one thing that possibly is better than eating either of these delicious breads: Smelling them as they are baking. Eating them still warm from the oven is another decided advantage to making them yourself.

                    Tips For Making Gluten Free Breads

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

1. Buy a machine that makes the one-and-one-half pound square-type loaf. This will enable you to make medium and small size loaves that are easy to slice for sandwiches and toast. We do not recommend making large size gluten-free loaves.

2. Gluten-free doughs are sticky and difficult to mix. Help your machine by checking on the dough often during the first five to ten minutes. Scrape down the sides of the pan with a soft rubber spatula.

3. Gluten-free dough does not look like ordinary wheat dough. Gluten-free doughs require more liquid and, in some recipes, resemble a batter more than a dough. By observing the dough mixing during the first five to ten minutes, you will get a feel for what gluten-free dough should look like and be able to adjust the liquid and dry ingredients accordingly.

4. The dough will mix more readily if you always add the liquid ingredients first. Do this even if your machine recommends that dry ingredients should go in first.

5. Gluten-free breads require extra yeast to rise. Some recipes will double or triple the amount of yeast called for in a similar recipe made with wheat flour.

6. If your machine has a yeast dispenser, do not use it. The bread will rise higher if you sprinkle the yeast on top of the dry ingredients just before you start the machine.

7. A combination of three or four flours will taste better than a mixture of just one or two flours. The bread will rise higher as well.

8. Never buy your flours from an open bin. They may be contaminated with small amounts of gluten-containing products. Use only products that are sealed in a package.

9. Wheat-free ingredients are not the same as gluten-free products.

10. Potato starch flour is not the same as potato flour. Potato flour is heavier and does not work well in gluten-free breads.

Categories    : Breads                          Daily Bread Mailing List
                Hand Made                       Whole Grain & Cereal Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  All-Purpose Flour -- (To 2 1/4 C)
     1/3          cups  Rolled Oats
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  1               cups  Warm Water -- (120 - 130 Deg)
  2               Tbsp  Honey -- Or
                        Maple Syrup
  1 1/2            Tsp  Cooking Oil
     2/3          cups  Whole Wheat Flour
                        Nonstick Spray Coating
                        Skim Milk
                        Rolled Oats

When making yeast breads, always check the temperature of the liquid with a thermometer before adding it to the yeast mixture. If it's too hot or too cold, the bread won't rise.

In a medium mixing bowl combine 1-1/4 cups of the all-purpose flour, the 1/3 cup oats, the yeast, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the water, honey or syrup, and oil. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed 3 minutes. Stir in whole wheat flour and as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can. On a lightly floured surface knead in enough remaining all-purpose flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Spray a bowl with nonstick coating. Place dough in bowl; turn once. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double in size (50 to 60 minutes). Punch down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

Spray an 8x4x2-inch loaf pan with nonstick coating. Shape dough into loaf; place in pan. Cover; let rise until nearly double (30 to 45 minutes). Brush with milk; sprinkle lightly with additional oats.

Bake in a 375F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when lightly tapped. Remove from pan. Cool on wire rack.

Makes 1 loaf (16 servings).

Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare and bake bread; cool completely. Freeze in a freezer container or bag up to 1 month. To serve, thaw bread at room temperature.

                      Wheat-Free Rice Flour Muffins

Recipe By     :Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads: Quick & Muffins
                Daily Bread Mailing List        Wheat-Free Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick spray for the pan
  1                cup  rice flour
     1/2           cup  millet or barley flour
     1/2           cup  oat flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4           cup  milk (plain soy milk will also work)
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup or light honey
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4        tablespoons  canola oil -- (1/2 stick)
                        -- or melted unsalted butter

1.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly spray 8 standard-sized
muffin cups with nonstick spray.

2.Place the flours in a medium-sized bowl with the baking powder
and salt. Stir until thoroughly combined.

3.Measure 3/4 cup milk into a 2-cup liquid measure, and measure in
the maple syrup or honey. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat
gently with a fork or a small whisk until well blended.

4.Slowly pour this mixture into the dry ingredients, along with the
oil or melted butter. Using a spoon or a rubber spatula, stir from
the bottom of the bowl until the dry ingredients are all moistened.
Don't overmix; a few lumps are okay.

5.Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups. For smaller
muffins, fill the cups about 4/5 of the way. For larger muffins, fill
them even with the top of the pan. If you have extra batter, spray
one or two additional muffin cups with nonstick spray, and put in
as much batter as you have.

6.Bake in the center of the oven for to 20 to 25 minutes, or until
lightly browned on top, and a toothpick inserted into the center
comes out clean. Remove the pan from the oven, then remove the
muffins from the pan and place them on a rack to cool. Wait at
least 30 minutes before serving. (To reheat, don't try splitting and
toasting these, as they are too crumbly. Better to just heat them,
whole, in a toaster oven. )

10 minutes to prepare; 20 to 25 minutes to bake
Yield: About 8 medium-sized muffins

NOTES : Just about any grain can be ground into flour, and each has its own
distinct personality and flavor. You can buy many kinds of flour at
natural foods stores, usually in 2-pound bags. Store them in an airtight
container in a cool dry place--ideally the freezer--to keep the flour fresh.
Most "alternative" (non-wheat) flours need to be combined with at least
some wheat in order for the final product to hold together and feel good
in the mouth. This is because wheat flour is the only kind that contains
sufficient gluten-forming proteins to give coherent structure and texture
to the result. That said, sometimes you can get away with leaving the
wheat flour out--and I know this is important for those of you with
wheat allergies. These wheat-free muffins are a case in point. They have
a lovely flavor and a texture much more delicate and crumbly (almost
powdery, in a nice kind of way) than "regular" muffins.

                Hand Made                       Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  All-Purpose Flour -- (To 3 C)
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  1 3/4           cups  Water
     1/3          cups  Packed Brown Sugar
  3               Tbsp  Shortening
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  2               cups  Whole Wheat Flour
  6               Tbsp  Butter Or Margarine -- Softened
                        Butter Or Margarine -- Softened

Bake these rolls right away or freeze the bread dough and bake 12, 24 or 36 rolls as needed.

1. In a large mixing bowl stir together 1-1/2 cups of the all-purpose flour and the yeast. In a small saucepan heat water, sugar, shortening, and salt just until warm (115F to 120F) and shortening is almost melted, stirring constantly. Add to flour mixture.

2. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl. Beat for 3 minutes on high speed. With a wooden spoon, stir in whole wheat flour and as much all-purpose flour as you can.

3. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining all-purpose flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total).

4. Shape dough into a ball; place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease surface. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 1 hour). Punch dough down; divide into thirds and shape each into a smooth ball. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

5. On a lightly floured surface roll 1 ball of dough into a 12-inch circle; spread with 2 tablespoons of the softened butter or margarine. Cut circle into 12 wedges.

6. To shape the rolls, begin at the wide end of the wedge and roll dough toward the point. Place, point side down, 2 to 3 inches apart on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let the rolls rise in a warm place until slightly more than doubled (about 45 minutes). Brush with melted butter.

7. Bake in a 400F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until brown. Remove from baking sheet; cool on wire racks. Brush again with melted butter or margarine. Makes 36 rolls. Make-ahead tip: After kneading, divide dough into thirds. Form each portion into a smooth ball. Wrap each ball in clear plastic wrap and transfer to freezer bags. Seal, label, and freeze up to 3 months. To serve, let dough stand in freezer bags at room temperature about 2-1/2 hours or until thawed (or thaw overnight in the refrigerator). Shape, let rise and bake as above.

This uses only part whole wheat flour...all whole wheat would make it too heavy....yield will depend on the size of each pizza

Sprinkle yeast & sugar over warm water in large bowl & stir to dissolve. Let stand 5 minutes. Mix in whole wheat flour, salt, and enough all purpose flour to form stiff dough. Knead until smooth, adding more all purpose flour if needed.

Greas bowl with olive oil and place dough in it, turning so top is greased. Let rise till double, about 1 hour. Punch down, form and fill. Let rise 30 to 45 minutes. Bake at 400F - 450F. Temp & time will depend on whether you use a stone.
