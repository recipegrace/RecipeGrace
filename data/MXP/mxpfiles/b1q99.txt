                Hand Made                       Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  water, lukewarm
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  30                    arugula leaves -- coarsely chopped
  20            sprigs  watercress -- coarsely chopped

1. Combine the milk and 1/2 cup of the water in the bowl of a heavy duty mixer or in a large mixing bowl.
2. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture, stir in, and let sit for 2 minutes.
3. Mix in 1 cup of the bread flour with the dough hook (or knead by hand).
5. Add the remaining 1/2 cup water, the remaining 1 1/2 cups bread flour, and salt.
6. Mix the dough hook 8-10 minutes (or by hand), or until dough appears resilient and silky.
7. Fold or knead the arugula and watercress into the dough until evenly distributed.
8. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
9. Let rise in a warm place for 2 hours.
10. Turn over a baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal or semolina flour.
11. Place dough on a work surface generously sprinkled with semolina flour and cut in 2 equal pieces.
12. Gently pull and stretch each piece into an 8 inch round or a 7 inch square.
13. Press each flatbread into the semolina flour, then flip to coat the other side.
14. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
15. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place 45 minutes to 1 hour.
16. Place a baking stone on the middle rack in the oven and preheat to 450 F.
17. Using a spray bottle, spritz the oven walls with water. Work quickly so oven doesn't lose heat.
18. Slide the flatbreads onto the hot stone.
19. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes, or until the bread browns.
20. Transfer the flatbreads to a rack to cool.

Yield: 2 flatbreads

BREAD MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Combine all the ingredients, except the arugula and watercress, in the bread pan in the
order specified by the manufacturer's instructions.

2. Process on the dough setting.

3. When the cycle is complete, turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface.

4. Knead the arugula and watercress into the dough until evenly distributed.

5. Continue with step 8 of the above recipe.
Note: People tend to do a double take when they first set eyes on this bright green bread. When they taste it, the spicy aromatic greens have the same effect on the palate! Arugula, also called rocket, has a peppery, pleasantly savory flavor. Use it as soon as possible as it loses its spark after a day or two.

NOTES : She's got a section on avocados. We can dry them. Only only takes 60 hours. two-and one-half days !!

(1/4-inch thick slices. Pre-treat -soak in ascorbic acid for 5 minutes. Dry for days at 100F)

She gives us this bread recipe to use the dried avocado. Wonder what this would taste like. Maybe like pecans, mostly? I don't see why we can't use ripe fresh avocado in this recipe. Can you?

NOTES : The Polish Easter and general festive cake has as its hallmark the use of
saffron as the traditional spice. The recipe for it probably came to Poland
from Italy in the sixteen century via queen Bona, as a transplant of the
Milanese panettone. Since then much ritual has surrounded the baking of
this fragile masterpiece. Precious pastry cooks declared it needed to rest
on an eiderdown before it went into the oven, after which baking took place
in an atmosphere of maternity. Men were forbittden to ender the kitchen and
no one was allowed to speak above a whisper.

Machine Procedure: All ingredients must be at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Add ingredients, except for filling, crumb topping, and egg wash, in the order specified in your ABM manual. Set ABM on dough/manual setting. At the end of program, press clear/stop. To punch dough down, press start and let knead for 60 secs. Press clear/stop again. Remove dough and let rest 5 mins before hand-shaping. If your ABM does not have a dough/manual setting, follow normal bread making procedure but let dough knead only once. At the end of the kneading cycle, press clear/stop. Let dough rise for 60 mins, checking after the first 30 mins. to make sure dough does not over rise and touch the lid. Press start and let machine run for 60 secs to punch dough down. Press clear/stop. Remove dough and let rest 5 mins before hand-shaping.

Hand-Shaping Technique: While the dough is rising, prepare your filling of choice by blending ingredients together with a fork until crumbly. To make crumb topping, blend all ingredients together with a fork until crumbly. Chill both until ready to use. Lightly grease a 4 1/2 x 8 1/2-inch loaf pan. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 10- x 20-inch rectangle. Cover with filling up to 1 inch from edges. Roll up lengthwise, jelly-roll fashion. Pinch seam and ends securely together so they do not open during baking. Carefully place babka in prepared pan. Fold ends under and shape into an S so that it fits in pan. Cover with a clean kitchen cloth and let rise until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 350F. Form a crease in the top of the risen babka with the side of your hand. Brush with egg wash and cover with crumb topping. Bake approximately 30 to 35 mins, or until golden. If babka begins to brown too quickly, cover top with foil. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

CHOCOLATE BABKA FILLING: Blend together unsweetened cocoa and sugar. Brush surface with melted butter. Sprinkle with cocoa-sugar mixture and pecans.

CHEESE BABKA FILLING: Blend together all the ingredients but raisins. After spreading the cheese filling on the babka, sprinkle with raisins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- DOUGH
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Yeast
  2                cup  Bread flour
  1 1/2           Tbsp  Sugar
  1           teaspoon  Salt
     3/4           cup  Water
  1               Tbsp  Barley malt syrup
                        -- TOPPINGS
  2               Tbsp  Poppy seeds or sesame seeds
                        -- OR kosher salt and -- minced onion

Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the order
suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the dough cycle according to the manufacturer's directions. At the end of the dough cycle, remove the dough from the machine. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large pot bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a roll 12 inches long. Make a circle of each piece, overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or rolling the overlap tightly to seal. Let the bagels rise for only 5 minutes. Add the malt syrup to the boiling water. (The syrup gives the bagels their golden color.) Lower a few bagels at a time into the boiling water. As soon as the bagels rise
to the top, remove with a skimmer or spatula to a lightly greased baking sheet.
Sprinkle about 3/4 tsp. of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake 20
minutes, or until golden.

                        -- SMALL (8)
     2/3           cup  Water
  1               Tbsp  Honey
  1                  t  Salt
     2/3           cup  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/3            cup  Bread flour
  1                  t  Yeast
                        ---
                        -- LARGE (16)
  1 1/3            cup  Water
  2               Tbsp  Honey
  2          teaspoons  Salt
  1 1/3            cup  Whole wheat flour
  2 2/3            cup  Bread flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  Yeast

Set for dough cycle.Let the machine knead the dough once, and then let the dough rise for only 20 minutes in the machine. Even if your cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces. Each piece should be rolled into a rope and made into a circle, pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end slightly to help seal the ends together.

Place these on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring to a slight boil in a "nonaluminum pan", (Donna German uses a cast iron frying pan) about 2 inches of water. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or dried onion bits if desired and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 550 degree oven for 8 minutes.

                  Baking Sourdough Loaves In Clay Bakers

                 *****

I have had wonderful results with my clay bakers. I have 2 long french bread pans with lids. I mix my sourdough loaves in the Breadmachine at Dough Cycle.
15 minutes or more before the cycle ends, I soak the bottom of the unglazed pans in the sink. After the 15 minute soak, remove and dry the inside only. When new, the pans need to be seasoned by spraying Pam on the inside SIDES only. Sprinkle the bottom heavily with cornmeal. Remove your dough from Breadmachine, punch down, shape into loaves, place in clay cookers, cover with waxed paper, let rise in preheated (2 minutes) oven. TURN OFF HEAT! Let rise again until double (about 30minutes or more). Now soak the tops! Remove and uncover the raised loaves from the oven. Spritz the loaves, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame and sunflower seed. Gently spray the inside of the soaked tops with Pam ( you need to do this only until seasoned). Place the tops on the cookers, and bake 30 minutes or more, in a 425F PREHEATED OVEN. Uncover, reduce heat to 375 or 400F to brown the tops, watch closely. Bread is done when the inside registers 190 with an instant-read thermometer. Turn out of pan at once to cool! Has a nice crust! Works for me!

  1                cup  butter
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  4                     eggs -- beaten
  6                     ripe bananas -- mashed
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  macadamia nuts

   In a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a light lemon
color. Then add the squashed bananas and the beaten eggs. Stir well until
all ingredients are completely mixed. Sift the flour, the salt and the
baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the chopped nuts. Again mix
until blended but make sure you do not mix the batter too much. Pre heat
the oven to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature pour the
batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake for 45 minutes. Before my
wife died she often watched while I was making a mess in her kitchen
doing my imitation of a bakery chef. She said that the Kona Inn Banana
Bread should be renamed Garbage bread because I never stuck to the recipe
and added all sorts of thing that I found such as any kind of chopped
nuts, lemon and orange zest, chopped apricots, chopped mango, coconut
flakes and one time I even added some mincemeat that was left over after
baking some mince pies. Perhaps the Kona Inn should have taken me to
court and forced me to stop making changes to their Banana Bread. Perhaps
my use of their name for the resulting strange flavored versions of their
Banana bread had something to do with their going out of business some
years ago.

  1                cup  water -- at room temperature
  1 1/2    tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  barley flour
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  gluten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rapid-rising or active dry yeast
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        (only if bread is baked in oven)
                        Sunflower seeds or sesame seeds, or -- optional
                        poppy seeds

Makes 1 lb.  loaf.

Note: Barley flour and gluten are available at food co-ops. This pretty loaf is glazed and topped with seeds. The texture is smooth and moist, with a mild whole-grain flavor.

To mix the dough in the bread machine: Pour the water into the pan. In the order listed, add the honey, salt, barley flour, whole wheat flour and gluten. Make an indentation in the dry ingredients and add the yeast.

If only mixing the dough: Select Dough and press Start. (Then read on to "For either method.")

If mixing AND baking dough in bread machine: Select Basic Cycle on bread machine, set the crust on Medium setting, and press Start.

For either method: During the mixing cycle, if the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not soft to the touch but is very firm, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch.

To shape and bake in the oven: Lightly grease a baking sheet. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or lightly oiled surface. Punch the dough down, and shape it into a round loaf. Place the loaf, with the smooth side up, into the pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, 45 minutes. Brush with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with sunflower seeds.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, until the loaf is golden and a wooden skewer inserted into the loaf comes out clean and dry. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.

  1         Tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/4           Cup  vegetable oil
  2 1/3           Cups  warm water -- (110F)
  1           Teaspoon  salt

                        fresh lemon juice
                        white sugar and ground cinnamon

Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Set aside until creamy.

In a large bowl, mix together oil, 2 1/3 cups water, salt, and 4 tablespoons sugar. Add yeast, and gradually mix in flour. Place dough in a buttered bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with a damp tea towel, and place in a warm place to rise for 1 1/2 hours.

Form dough into balls about the size of eggs, then roll flat to making ovals about 1/4 inch thick.

Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep fryer, pot, or electric frying pan. Fry beaver tails one at a time, until light brown on both sides. Place on paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with white sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice while still hot. Makes 3 dozen

Note: If you ever visited Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in the winter months on the Rideau Canal, which is the longest skating rink in the world, they serve what is called Beaver Tails. This is a pastry with sugar on top. I could not get the authentic recipe since it is their trade secret, but I do have a replica of what they serve. The beaver is the national animal of Canada.

Set your bread machine on manual

Poke the start button and "let 'er rip" When the machine shuts off divide the dough into 3 pieces, roll each piece into a round ball and place approx. 4" apart on flat pan (I used a baking stone and the bottom comes out crusty too). Bake about 8 minutes at 375 and test for doneness. Cool on rack. When ready to use simply cut off the top and scrape out some of the insides, leaving approx 1/2" all around. Make sure the kids are around when you do this as none of the bread will go to waste!! Fill with soup or chowder and enjoy!!

** This same recipe can also be made on the french bread setting of your machine and let
it bake in the machine.

                        dry ingredients for 1 1/2 lb loaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry yeast

This approach allows prepackaging of dry ingredients for bread machine baking. Storage may be in canning jars or in other containers such as zip lock bags. I print address labels with the "at time of baking" ingredients and place them on the container.

The 1 1/2 pound loaf dry ingredients fit in a 1 quart canning jar or in a 1 quart zip lock freezer bag. I have white plastic screw caps for the canning jars for sealing the jar (from grocery store). A canning funnel helps for filling the jars (green plastic from grocers but also have aluminum version from years past). I have found that filling a mason jar and then using the canning funnel at the mouth of a 1 quart zip lock bag allows transfer to the bag with minimum of mess and hassle. I make 6-10 bread mixes at a time.

For 2 pound loaf, larger jars or larger bags are needed.

This bread has a good high texture with a lot of "spring" from the gluten. Depending on the moisture of the flour, an additional tablespoon or two of water may be needed during the initial kneading in the bread machine.

Variations:
Replace the whole wheat with spelt flour or triticale flour in the dry ingredients
Replace the whole wheat with rye flour in the dry ingredients and and add either orange peel or caraway seeds with a tablespoon of molasses when loading the bread machine.
Add a package or two of instead oatmeal to the measuring cup before filling it with whole wheat flour.

Getting more for your dough: Baking bread in the bread machine is only part of the story. The untapped and unpromoted potential as well as sheer magic of the bread machine is in its ability to provide batches of proofed yeast doughs with which to become creative. How might this differ from a traditional mixer with dough hook, you ask? In a couple of ways: firstly, the bread machine is an enclosed container so a floury, messy kitchen is never a deterrent to an afternoon's baking. Two, a bread machine is the perfect proofer for doughs: a warm, moist environment, covered and draft-free, cradling the multiplying yeast and attracting the odd wild yeast as well.(Incidentally, the more you bake - bread machine style or otherwise, the more wild yeast begin to congregate in your kitchen, attracting to what is perceived as a conducive atmosphere. Over time, straight doughs, sour dough based or sponge-initiated, take on more flavour as they mingle with these visiting spores).


Mixer or handmade doughs require the oiled bowl, wet kitchen towels and an environment such as a oven with the oven light on - more work and more clean-up. No, I wouldn't chuck my adored stand-up mixer. It does larger batches of dough and can also make cake, cookies, and pie crust but.... sometimes it's nice to produce scads of Parker House Rolls or a small Sally Lund without it being a whole production number. Bagels (and yeast doughnuts too) in particular, take a lot of handling (ring-forming, boiling and baking) so getting a head start by having the dough made for you is a real plus.


Pizza dough, destined for calzone, focaccia, bread sticks and hard rolls, emerges regularly from the bread machine. At a certain point in my schedule, I just don't need to prepare each and every "utilitarian" dough by hand. Finally, in bread machine baking you are usually dumping in ingredients - no spatulas and wooden spoons to contend with and the non-stick mixing-cum-baking pan takes seconds to clean. Hot water simply sluices gummy batters right off the slippery surface.


Bread machine baking for slicing loaves: I often allow my bread machine to mix and bake one loaf of dough (particularly good for producing an airy white slicing loaf for sandwiches that kids - bless 'em - prefer) while maneuvering some other batch of dough nearby into a pan of rolls, a sheaf of wheat or free-form length, and bake in a regular oven. Doughs made in the machine but baked in the oven have an entirely different texture and crust, not to mention shape (in the bread machine the shape is necessarily restricted). Most recently, my machine is the mother ship for bubbling sponge starters (Check out La Technique, French Bread At Home).


A flour-water-yeast slurry are permitted to sit overnight and froth in the bread machine - cover down. The next day I continue on with a recipe, adding in more flour and yeast. Once the dough has had a short rise, it is plucked out of the machine. Then I proceed with more conventional methods to produce crusty French country breads. These are the result of several long rises on the counter or even longer rises in the fridge (if my schedule includes a gamut of car pools or other interruptions) and a brisk, hot bake in an steamy oven on terra cotta tiles.


Sourdough breads, cinnamon scented sweet doughs, herb breads, English muffins - you name it - all begin as bread machine doughs and graduate into the exotic with a hands-on finish. Having the machine do some intermediary steps in an unobtrusive way (when the machine is on my hands are free) encourages an upgrade in both the quality and quantity of home bakery. Too often home bakers get bogged down by the rigors of each and every loaf that they cannot progress beyond basics or get worn out thinking about a larger bread project. As bread machine owners begin to de-program themselves from the thrill of overnight bread they begin a baking journey that starts with dough and is only limited by a baker's imagination.


Recipes: Most bread machines come with recipe books that range from outstanding and dependable to limited recipes with ambiguous results. If you are having difficulties with a machine recipe booklet, do take advantage at the many other very creative, bread machine books on the market. It's just a matter of time until you achieve your goals. No one recipe works exactly for each machine the same way and some user flexibility is a pre-requisite. Some books imply that they are the final word on "perfect" bread machine baking - but never forget, this is baking, not engineering - there is no one-size-fits-all recipe when you're dealing with flour and yeast.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2           packages  yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  6               cups  flour
                        butter -- melted

In a saucepan, heat milk, sugar, salt, and butter. Cool to lukewarm.

In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Combine milk mixture, yeast, and 1 1/2 cup flour; beat till smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes.

Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.

Punch dough down. Pinch off dough, and roll into long strips. Place strips on greased baking sheets 1" apart. Brush with melted butter. Cover and let rise 15 minutes.

Bake at 400F for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

*For a milder flavor and golden color try white whole wheat flour and berries (kernels).

**To cook wheat berries (kernels): Place 1/2 cup clean, uncooked wheat berries in small saucepan; cover with two cups water. Let stand overnight. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 to 45 minutes or until berries are tender. Rinse with cold water; drain thoroughly. Place cooled berries in sealable bag and store in the refrigerator. Use as needed. Berries will keep up to one week in the refrigerator. Or, bring berries and water to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 60 to 90 minutes, stirring occasionally, until water is absorbed and berries are tender.

If you bake it in the oven, you can brush an egg wash on it (1 egg yolk, 2 tsp water) right before putting it in. This makes for a softer crust, so my kids eat it, whereas the machine-baked crust is harder, and they don't eat it!

NOTES : My kids didn't really like any of the recipes I was trying, until I started making Challah, an egg bread. I usually make the dough in the machine and then braid it and bake it in the oven, but I've also baked it in the machine, and it's good that way, too. I don't know where I got the recipe -- it may have even been in the Digest. Anyway, here it is:

Bread machine on 'dough' cycle: add all ingredients except for melted butter and sesame seeds. (You may wish to add the cheeses later in the cycle if your machine - like the Black & Decker - has a beeper for adjuncts).
At the end of the cycle, gently deflate dough. Cut into four random slabs. Place in a greased 12 by 5 inch loaf pan or a 10 inch springform pan. Cover and let rise 30-40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 F. Drizzle on melted butter then sprinkle on sesame seeds.

Bake until golden brown (30-35 minutes). Let rest in pan before removing to
a rack.

NOTES : Buttery, cheesy, crusty. This bread is cut into rough slabs before rising. Once it rises, it merges into a unique loaf. Perfect for a caesar salad break or an omelette supper. This bread is bigger than the sum of its parts.

  2               cups  unbleached flour

Combine the flour, dry mustard, paprika and baking powder in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, either by hand or with an electric mixer at medium speed, until light and fluffy. Slowly beat in the cheddar cheese and Worcestershire sauce. Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring with a fork, until well blended. On a lightly floured surface, shape the dough into a long roll about 1 3/4-inches in diameter. Wrap in plastic wrap or foil. Place on a platter and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, better overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Slice the dough about 1/3 inch thick. With your hands, roll each slice into a ball. Flatten slightly and place on an ungreased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake 8 minutes in the preheated oven. Biscuits will only brown slightly on the bottom.

                Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour -- unsifted
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast -- bulk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  unbleached flour -- unsifted
     1/4           cup  butter
  1           teaspoon  milk
  1            package  active dry yeast -- or
  3          teaspoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
  3          teaspoons  butter
  1                cup  cheddar -- sharp, grated
  1                     egg yolk -- lg

Place the grated cheese in a small bowl and cover to prevent drying then set aside. Combine 1 1/2 cups unsifted flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large mixer bowl, blending thoroughly. Measure 3/4 c of milk, water, and butter into a saucepan and heat until the liquids are warm, 115 to 120 degrees F.. Gradually add the liquids to the dry ingredients in the mixer bowl, beating for 2 minutes at medium speed of the electric mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally. Add and beat in 1 cup of unsifted flour at high speed. Beat for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally. Mix in enough additional flour (1/2 to 1 cup unsifted) to make a soft dough. (Dough will be slightly sticky.) Put the dough into a greased deep bowl. Cover with waxed paper and a clean towel and let stand in a warm place until the dough has doubled, 45 to 60 minutes. Generously grease several baking sheets. Melt the butter and set aside. Punch the dough down wit a fist and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal portions. Set one portion aside. Roll the dough into a rectangle 16 X 8-inches. Brush with about one-half of the melted butter. Sprinkle with about one half of the grated cheddar cheese. Cut crosswise into 8 equal portions. Cut into halves lengthwise. Fold each strip into thirds, lapping each side portion over the center third. Place the rolls on a baking sheet. Repeat for the other half of the dough. Beat the egg yolk with the tbls of milk, slightly. Brush the tops of the rolls with the egg yolk mixture. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 425F. for about 8 minutes or until rolls are golden brown. Serve rolls hot.

Soften yeast in warm water and stir in sugar. Scald milk in medium saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and add 1/2 cup butter and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Stir beaten eggs and yeast mixture into lukewarm milk mixture. Gradually beat in 3 cups flour and cheese with wooden spoon to make soft dough. If dough is too soft, gradually add more flour until desired consistency.

Transfer dough to greased bowl and turn to grease all over. Cover and let rise in warm place free from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Divide dough in half and roll out each portion on floured surface into rectangle 1/3-inch thick.

Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter. Cut dough into 3-inch diamond shapes. Dip each piece of dough into melted butter and layer in greased 10-inch ring mold, overlapping points. There should be 3 layers, but pan should be no more than 3/4 full or dough will pop off while baking. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Bake at 400 degrees until lightly browned, about 35 minutes.

Cheese Monkey Bread was a rage in the '60s and '70s, when bakeries in Los Angeles began selling it. Clever readers reconstructed this recipe, and we've been printing it ever since. See also, Short-Cut Monkey Bread - LA Times, a recipe we developed at the Times. It uses refrigerator crescent rolls.

  1                can  sliced ripe olives -- (2.25 oz.) well
                        drained
                        ---
  2       tablespoons.  bread or all-purpose flour

* (I like to use a mixture of oregano, basil, and thyme -- you can use fresh, chopped herbs or dried herbs)

Makes:  2 loaves

Sponge:
Blend ingredients together thoroughly in medium bowl.  Cover; place in
refrigerator for 12-24 hours, or up to 1 week.

Bread:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (400 if using convection).

In a large mixing bowl, combine all bread ingredients (sponge through ripe olives) and knead for 7-9 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into two equal portions (you may also make 4 individual-sized bread loaves). The dough will be sticky and soft, so you may wish to flour your hands before working with the dough.

Roll each portion into a roughly oval shape approximately 3/4" thick. These breads are more beautiful if they are shaped irregularly. Dust loaves lightly with flour. Place loaves on a baking sheet sprinkled lightly with cornmeal. Let rise for 20-30 minutes until doubled in thickness and puffy.

Bake for 25-27 minutes until loaves are slightly browned on top and sound hollow when tapped. Remove from oven; cool on wire rack.


NOTE: these loaves are excellent when used for sandwiches or "quick" pizzas.

For sandwiches: slice loaf in half horizontally; toast lightly. Top one half with sandwich filling, place other half on top. Serve.

For quick pizzas: brush very lightly with olive oil and other pizza toppings (cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni, chopped fresh vegetables, herbs) and place under broiler until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve immediately.

NOTES : Recently I've been extremely busy with work, studies, etc., and this bread has become one of my "easy favorites" to make. The sponge can be made ahead of time, and I've left it in the refrigerator for as long as a week and had great results. It is super-easy to make, requiring a single rise before it gets popped into the oven.

I highly recommend a baking stone for this bread, because it gets a wonderful crust and puffs up very nicely when baked directly on the stone.

The shaping of the bread is also relatively freeform, and I've divided the dough into 2-4 portions, resulting in round, oval, or squarish shaped "loaves".

If you want to make a kind of "plain" bread that's good for toast and jelly, butter, honey, etc., you can simply omit the herbs, onion, and olives.

NOTES : I found a recipe in a Land O'Lakes brochure that promised to make a loaf of bread that tastes just like a commercial cinnamon bun. Well, it doesn't, but it is extremely good. Warm with sweet butter, it's darned close to a cinnamon roll in flavor, albeit not in texture.

NOTES : I kind of put this recipe together myself, and after allot of trial and error, have come up with a very moist, soft, and beautiful Cinnamon Raisin Bread.....it turns out just right every time!!! And it stores for days too!

Sometimes I double the recipe, and run it through the dough cycle, then divide the dough into 4 small loaf pans, let rise and bake in my oven (350=BA 30-35 minutes). It works great that way too.

I took some of it to a Baby shower for my daughter today, and was surprised at the "wows" and rave reviews! Everyone asked for the Recipe (thank goodness I had a copy with me).

Basically, if your recipe calls for 6 - 7 cups of flour, divide the recipe in half for a 1 lb loaf. Your ingredients will be approximately:

7/8 - 1 cup liquid
2 - 2 2/3 cups flour
1/4 - 1 tsp salt
2 tsp - 3 T fat
2 tsp - 3 T sweetener
1 1/2 - 2 tsp yeast

You may have to experiment a few times to get it just right. Watching the dough as it mixes helps to produce good results. It should form a smooth, pliable, slightly tacky ball of dough about half way through the kneading cycles. If it appears too wet or too dry, add more liquid or flour a tablespoon at a time, as needed.

Any recipe calling for approximately 6 cups of flour (which can include cracked wheat, old fashioned rolled oats, etc.) can be converted for us in bread machines. 6 cups in the magic number because it can be easily divided by 3 or 2. Every cup of flour represents 1/2 lb. of bread. The math is easy, although the formula does NOT apply to yeast. And the amount of yeast makes a significant difference in the outcome of the bread. Take my word for it ~~ my calculations for the yeast conversions work.

FOR A 1 LB LOAF; Divide all the ingredients in your
 6 cup recipe by 3 except for the yeast. Put the ingredients into the machine in the order specified in the manual. Use 1 tsp. of yeast for white flours breads. For breads containing whole wheat flour, increase the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp. If you find that the finished bread is dense, next time increase the yeast by 1/2 tsp.

FOR A 1.5 LB. LOAF; Divide all ingredients in half,
 except for the yeast. Put the ingredients into the machine in the order specified in the manual. Use 2 tsp. yeast for white flour breads. For breads containing whole wheat flour, increase the yeast to 2 1/2 tsp. If the baked bread is dense, next time increase the yeast by 1/2 tsp.

NOTES : I used to work with a wonderful lady who was a school cook in Eastern Colorado. Every day she made fresh bread, in some form, for their lunch. She gave me a recipe for cream buns, which she said was her family's favorite. They are now my family's too! I made them one evening for a group of college students' breakfast. Came back after shopping, and they were gone...they couldn't resist the buns. They suggested I make more for breakfast...<g>

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               Tbsp  Corn Oil
  1 1/3           Cups  White Cornmeal
     2/3           Cup  All-Purpose Flour
  2                Tsp  Baking Powder
  1                Tsp  Salt

  1                Cup  Buttermilk
  2                     Eggs -- Beaten

Preheat oven to 400F. Pour the tablespoon of oil into a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, and place the skillet in the oven. Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add 1/3 cup oil. Add buttermilk and beaten eggs. Stir with fork until blended. Slide skillet out with a rack (use a mitt, Cunningham reminds), and pour in mixture. Bake for 25 minutes or until brown on top.
Cool 5 minutes before turning out on plate.

Note: Arlene D. Johnson of San Jose sent her family's version, from Mississippi, and the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons bacon grease to grease the pan. That makes for a down-home, Southern taste. Robert Vogel of San Jose advised adding the grease to the skillet and heating ``until it pops and crackles when the pan is wiggled.''

When making pancakes, always do a test pancake first. If the batter is too thick to spread on the griddle, thin it with a very small amount of milk.

Mix cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda in a large bowl. Add plain yogurt (or buttermilk), oil, eggs. Beat briskly with a wooden spoon just until well mixed; batter will be thick. Heat griddle or large nonstick skillet over high heat. Reduce heat to med and oil griddle very lightly. For each pancake, pour a scant 1/4 C on griddle. Cook 3 - 4 min until lightly browned on bottom.

Makes 24 - 26.

Add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture in mixing bowl. Stir in egg substitute, vanilla and salt. Beat in 1 cup flour. Beat in enough remaining flour to make soft dough.

Knead about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Put dough into greased bowl. Let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over chopped cranberries. Let stand while bread rises. Drain excess liquid off cranberries. Knead cranberries into dough. Shape into round. Spray baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly. Place dough round on baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool to warm. Makes 8 servings.

NOTES : I used to work with a wonderful lady who was a school cook in Eastern Colorado. Every day she made fresh bread, in some form, for their lunch. She gave me a recipe for cream buns, which she said was her family's favorite. They are now my family's too! I made them one evening for a group of college students' breakfast. Came back after shopping, and they were gone...they couldn't resist the buns. They suggested I make more for breakfast...<g>

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1                cup  warm water
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  honey -- liquid
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (approx)
     3/4           cup  whole wheat flour
     1/4           cup  rolled oats -- quick-cooking
     1/4           cup  cornmeal
     1/4           cup  bran -- natural
     1/4           cup  millet -- or sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  salt

In large bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle in yeast; let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy. Whisk in honey, butter and egg.

With wooden spoon, stir in 2 cups of the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, cornmeal, bran, millet and salt until smooth. Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to form slightly sticky dough.

Turn out onto floured surface; knead for 8 to 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic, dusting with as much of the remaining flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease all over. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in warm draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1-1/2 hours.

Punch down dough; turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead into round loaf, stretching dough down all around and pinching underneath to shape. Dust top with flour; place on greased baking sheet. Cover with clean towel let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 to 60 minutes.

Using serrated knife, slash shallow grid pattern on top of loaf. Bake in centre of 375F oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped on bottom. Remove from pan; let cool on rack.

Makes 1 loaf, 24 slices.

NOTES : I made the dough for this bread today in my bread machine on the dough cycle and then shaped it and baked it on my pizza stone. I did not have millet or enough sesame seeds, so used equal amounts of seven grain cereal since it contains millet.

I would suggest starting with only 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour and adding more if necessary.

Delicious and gorgeous to look at!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

                        -- Poolish (Starter):
  1                cup  cool water, about 65F
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
     1/4      teaspoon  (a pinch) SAF Perfect Rise Yeast
                        -----
                        Dough:
     1/2           cup  cool water -- about 65F
  2               cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- (2 to 2 1/2)
  2          teaspoons  SAF Perfect Rise Yeast
                        -- (remainder of yeast packet if using
                        one)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt

Starter:
Combine all poolish ingredients, mixing just till a cohesive dough forms. Allow the dough to rest, covered, for 12 to 16 hours at room temperature. When the poolish is ready, it will be filled with large holes and bubbles.

Dough:
Add the water to the poolish, and mix till smooth. Add the flour, yeast and salt, and knead the dough till it's fairly smooth but not necessarily elastic, about 3 minutes by machine, or 5 minutes by hand. (The gluten will continue to develop as the dough rises, so you don't want to develop it fully during the kneading process.) Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, for 1 1/2 hours. To help develop the gluten and distribute the yeast's food, turn the dough twice during the rising time: gently fold all four sides into the middle, and turn the dough over. Divide dough in thirds, and roll each third into a 20-inch-long rope. Braid ropes. Set braid on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until just puffy. Gently brush braid with beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake bread in a preheated 425°F oven for 25 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
Yield: 1 loaf

                 *****

In answer to your question about prefermented dough, this would be a sponge, or part of a bread dough recipe that is mixed with yeast and allowed to begin fermenting before all the dough is mixed - i.e., pre-fermenting. A natural leaven (sourdough) starter could also be considered a preferment but more generally the term is applied to a yeasted sponge. It's sort of "commercial baker's" language but is becoming popularized through some of the new bread books such as Brother Peter Reinhart's "Crust & Crumb".

                        ***INGREDIENTS***
  1            package  hot roll mix -- (16 oz.)
  1                     egg -- (for egg wash)
  1                     orange -- zest of
     1/4           cup  chopped almonds
                        mix
                        ***TO COLOR EGGS***
  9                     raw eggs
                        wilton icing colors
  1                cup  boiling water
  1           teaspoon  vinegar

Directions for Loaves: Line pan cavities with baking cups. Prepare dough as directed on mix package, adding the almonds and orange zest. On lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12 x 9 in. rectangle. Cut into nine 1 in. strips. Cut each strip in half. Lightly roll each half into a rope and twist. Wrap one rope around inside of baking cup. Place colored Easter egg in middle of dough. Repeat with second rope of dough. Preheat oven to 375F. Set breads in warm place and allow to rise 20-30 minutes or until doubled. Brush dough with egg wash (egg mixed with 2 tablespoons water). Do not brush on the colored Easter egg. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 9 petite loaves.

Directions for coloring eggs: Mix all ingredients together and let stand 5 minutes (Wilton Icing Colors, boiling water and vinegar). Dip eggs in solution; remove eggs and let dry. Eggs are placed in bread raw, they will be hard cooked when bread is done.

My suggestion: I find that only white shell raw eggs give you the desired true colors of the favorite Easter Eggs. To each their own.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast -- (1 Tbs, 15 ml)
     1/4           cup  lukewarm water -- (60 ml)
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  honey -- (125 ml)
  1        tablespoons  ground coriander -- (15 ml)
     1/2           tsp  ground cinnamon -- (2 ml)
     1/4           tsp  ground cloves -- (1 ml)
  1                tsp  salt -- (5 ml)
  1                cup  lukewarm milk -- (250 ml)
  6                Tbs  melted butter -- (90 ml)
  4               cups  all purpose flour -- (1 to 1.25 L) (4 to
                        -- 4 1/2)

Dissolve the yeast in the water and allow to "proof" in a warm place for 5 minutes, until it is frothy. Combine the egg, honey, spices, and salt in a deep bowl and stir to combine the ingredients. Add the yeast mixture, milk, and 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the butter, stirring to thoroughly combine. Stir in the flour 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time, adding only enough flour to make a dough that can be gathered into a ball. When the dough becomes too stiff to use a spoon, mix in the additional flour with your hands. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a dish cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Using a pastry brush, spread the remaining butter on the bottom and sides of a round 3 quart (3 L) baking dish, about 3 inches (8 cm) deep and 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter. Punch the dough down and knead for 1 or 2 minutes. Shape the dough into a round and place it in the baking dish, pressing it out so that it covers the entire bottom of the dish. Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in volume. Bake in a preheated 300F (150C) oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until the top is crusty and light golden brown. Turn the loaf out of the baking dish onto a wire rack to cool. This bread may be eaten while still warm or completely cooled, and is traditionally served with butter and honey. Makes one 8 inch (20 cm) round loaf.

  1            package  Active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  Warm water (105-115 deg)
     1/2           cup  Warm 1% lowfat milk
     1/4           cup  Granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  Margarine
  2          teaspoons  Ground cardamom
  1           teaspoon  Dried orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  Salt
  1                cup  Rye flour
  2              large  Eggs, room temperature -- lightly beaten

  1              large  Egg white
     1/4         ounce  Sliced almonds for garnish -- (Optional)

Stir yeast into warm water until dissolved; set aside. In a large bowl combine milk, sugar, margarine, cardamom, orange peel and salt; stir in the rye flour, mixing well. Add yeast mixture to dough; gradually add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, until dough forms a ball. Sprinkle clean work surface with 2 tablespoons flour; turn out dough and knead, gradually adding the remaining flour, for 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic (dough will be stiff). Coat a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Place dough in bowl and turn to coat surface. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Spray clean work surface with nonstick cooking spray. Punch down dough and divide into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 16-inch rope. Coat jelly roll pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line up ropes on prepared pan; braid ropes lightly, starting at center and working to ends. Press each end firmly and tuck under. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 475F. Bake for 15 minutes; tent with foil and bake for 15 minutes longer, until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on rack.

Makes about 16 servings.

                 *****

Bernard Clayton, in an Appendix to his "New Complete Book of  Breads" gives the equivalence for flour (unsifted),

3 1/2 cups = 1 pound

However, he also, in the same appendix, gives

1 cup = 4 3/4 ounces,

which would yield 3 1/2 cups = 1 pound + a bit more than half an ounce.

For fun, I weighed the flours in my cupboard without sifting using a good metric balance scale. One cup varied from 144 to 156 grams depending on the flour. This is about half an ounce higher than Clayton's equivalence (1 ounce = 28.5 grams). When I sifted, the weights dropped by about 7% on average.

I conclude that these equivalences are not exact, and bread bakers seem to go largely by feel of the dough anyway. You probably should use them as a first try. Maybe a precise standard is not possible given the differences that exist among flours. On the other hand, weighing probably does give more consistent results.

By the way, if I am giving more detail than you like, blame breadmaker/author Peter Reinhart. His classes and books stress both precision and feel. For example, he tests bread for doneness by measuring internal temperature with a probe thermometer. What a simple idea, yet how well it works! I for one have never been able to rap on a loaf with my knuckles and decide whether a hollow sound is produced, the usual test for doneness.

  1         Tablespoon  sugar

Sized to make dough in a Breadman 2 pound bread machine -- This is a maximum load on the bread machine.

This is a nice size for a kitchen aid mixer with a dough hook. Put ingredients into pan and run dough cycle.

Check as kneading to assure the dough is soft enough to not overload the bread machine. Add a tablespoon or two of water as needed. ( different moisture contents in flours will change the amount of water needed for a batch)

After the dough cycle finishes, press the dough out on a pizza pan (either flat or Chicago deep dish style) that has been lightly oiled. allow to rise until doubled. bake at a 375 degree oven until browned about 20-25 minutes -- cool for at least 10-15 minutes before cutting into wedges and serving.

This is a large flat loaf about an inch to inch and a half thick 14-16 inches in diameter..

This is a good bread with lots of flavors -- it is good served with a meal or for sandwiches. Bread and spreads form a good supper on nights were all are tired. Good sliced

Options:

Brush the top with olive oil before baking Brush the top with olive oil from dried tomatoes before baking Push small indentations into the top and put dried tomato strips (from dried tomatoes in oil) into indentations before baking. Push small indentation into the top and put black olives into the indentation before baking

Slice horizontally and fill with sliced tomatoes, cheese, and peppers

NOTES : The focaccia is popular with the family members with the flavoring added.Leave all but the pepper and garlic out and you have a great pizza crust for flat pans, screens, or a Chicago style pizza pan.  Leave out the pepper and garlic and it makes a good plain italian style loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              heads  roasted garlic -- pureed
  2        tablespoons  dry yeast -- (2 pk)
  2 1/2           cups  warm water
  3 1/4           cups  whole wheat flour
  1                     cornmeal
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (115-120 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  3 1/4           cups  unbleached all purpose flour

Cream together the garlic puree and butter. (This may be done days in advance and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before using). Combine the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water in large bowl. Stir with a fork or small whisk. Add an additional 2 1/2 cups water. Add salt. Stir in the flour, 1 c at a time, beginning with the whole wheat. Use a whisk until the dough becomes stiff, then switch to a wooden spoon. Turn the dough onto a well floured work surface. Knead rhythmically for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth, springy, nonsticky, and elastic. Add more flour as you knead if necessary. The dough is ready if you can poke to fingers into it and the resulting indentations spring back. Cover the dough with a cloth and let rest while you wash, dry and generously butter the bowl. Knead the dough a few more turns, then form it into a ball and place it in the bowl. Turn it to coat with butter. Cover the bowl and put it in a warm, draft-free place until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. It has risen sufficiently when you can gently poke a finger into the dough and the hole remains. (Don't poke too enthusiastically or the dough will collapse.) When doubled, flour your fist and punch the dough down. Knead it a few times and then let it rest. Sprinkle 1 large or 2 small baking sheets with a liberal amount of cornmeal. Divide the dough into 3 equal parts. While you work with 1 piece, keep the other 2 covered. Flour your work surface. With a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a rectangle approximately 14-inches long X 7-inches wide. Spread it with softened garlic butter. Roll the long edge toward the opposite long edge, as if you were rolling up a rug. Pinch ends closed. Place loves on the baking sheets. With a sharp knife or razor blade, slash the loves lightly at 2-inch intervals. Cover with a cloth and place in a warm draft-free place to rise until doubled, about 1/2 hour. Meanwhile preheat oven to 400F. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes with a pan of boiling water on the oven floor. Spray loaves with water several times during the baking process. (This helps the bread form a thick crusty shell.) To test for doneness, rap the loaf with your knuckles. The loaf should sound hollow. Cool on wire racks, but the loaves are delicious eaten warm right out of the oven.

  1                 pk  Yeast
  1        tablespoons  White sugar
  12              cups  Bread flour
  12              cups  Medium rye flour
  2               cups  Whole wheat flour

  2        tablespoons  Cider vinegar
     1/2            oz  Unsweetened chocolate

(I would cut back on that a bit) Cool the mixture to 105-115 degrees and add to dry ingredients. I suspect the exact ingredients don't really matter all that much. As long as the flour-to-liquid proportions are such as to make a dough of good consistency, the result will probably be highly edible.

Cream 1 pound (450 g) butter and 1+1/2 cups (375 ml) sugar until fluffy. Stir in 5 cups (1.25 L) flour and the yeast mixture. Blend 1 cup (250 ml) flour with the fruits and nuts. Add the flour and fruit mixture, the spices, the lemon peel, and the remaining flour, mixing well to form a firm dough. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead thoroughly. Place in a large greased bowl, cover with a dish towel, and allow to rise until it has doubled in volume. Punch the dough down and turn onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 3 or 4 sections and shape each section into a thick oval shape. Fold one of the ends of the dough about 3/4 of the way over the other and gently press the edges together. Place on greased cookie sheets and allow the loaves to rise until doubled in size. Brush the loaves with melted butter and bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes, depending on the size of the loaves, until golden brown. If the loaves brown too fast, cover with aluminum foil. When loaves are done, brush with melted butter and spoon a little rum or brandy (optional) over the loaves and allow it to soak in. Sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar. Allow the bread to mellow for 2 or 3 days before cutting. Slice thinly and serve with whipped butter. Keep tightly wrapped.

Makes 3 or 4 loaves.

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               tbsp  dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  warm water -- (105-115 F)
  2               tbsp  solid shortening
  1               tbsp  sugar
  2                tsp  salt
  6               cups  all purpose flour -- (6 to 7)
                        -- [I had to use 7-8 cups]
  3                     egg whites -- stiffly beaten
  1                     egg white -- beaten with cold
                        milk for egg wash
                        optional: poppy seeds -- for tops
                        caraway seeds
                        or sesame seeds

Add yeast to water and proof. Add shortening, sugar, salt & 3 cups of the flour. Beat with dough whisk or heavy spoon for 2 minutes.

Fold egg whites into yeast mixture. Gradually add flour 1/4 cup at a time, until dough forms a mass & begins to pull away from bowl. Turn onto a floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as necessary, for 8-10 minutes, until smooth & elastic w/ bubbles.

Place in oiled bowl, turn to coat, and cover with damp towel. Let rise until double, about 1 hour.

Punch down, cover & let rise again until double (about 45 minutes.)

Punch down & turn out onto lightly oiled surface.

For Kaiser or Weck: Divide dough into 18 equal pieces. Use rolling pin to flatten each piece into a 7 inch circle. Fold left side to center to form a flap. Halfway down flap fold again to center to form another flap. Repeat all the way around to make over- lapping flaps. Lift the first flap to ease the last flap underneath. Press center to seal the dough. This design takes practice, but is easy once you get the hang of it. Place rolls upside down on a well-greased baking sheet, 3 inches apart. This helps them keep their shape. Let rise 30 minutes, turn right side up, let rise 15 more
minutes.

For Brotchen: Divide dough into 24 pieces. Shape each into an oval about 3 1/2 inches long. Place on well greased baking sheet. If your oven will not fit all at once, prepare half at a time, keeping rest covered for 15 minutes. Flatten tops slightly. Cover & let rise 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425. Put a shallow pan on the bottom shelf of oven.

Lightly brush the rolls with egg wash. Sprinkle with seeds or coarse salt ,if desired. Place 1 cup of ice cubes in the heated pan in oven. Immediately put the rolls in and bake 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown (internal temp will read 190). Remove & cool on racks.

NOTE: I made 16, rather than 18 rolls...that allowed me to easily space 4 per cookie sheet. I left half the dough covered while I formed the first 8. After 15 minutes I started on the second half -- this worked out well. Shaping them wasn't as easy as it sounds (I'm visualizationly challenged!), but the rolls puffed up a lot as they rose and even though they looked like a convention of amoebas to begin with, expanded a lot and when baked were fine. Crisp crust, airy interior, best Kaiser recipe I've found!

NOTES : I understand how Thomas Denny O'Neal feels about being far away from great Kaiser rolls...I'm an transplanted New Yorker in eastern North Carolina and biscuits just don't cut it for me. I have tried many Kaiser roll recipes and here's the best one I've found.

"Kaiser & Brotchen are made from the same dough, but shaped differently. Kaiser has the 5 sided pinwheel design, Brotchen are smaller & oval shaped. In Buffalo, NY Kaiser rolls are glazed & sprinkled with seeds, called Weck Rolls."

  10            ounces  cheddar -- sharp, grated
  4                     egg yolks -- lg
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

  4                     egg whites -- lg

Thoroughly grease a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Place the cheddar in a small bowl and set aside. Scald the milk in the top of a double boiler. Meanwhile beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored then set them aside. When the milk is scalded, add the corn meal very gradually, stirring constantly. Stir until the mixture thickens and becomes smooth. Remove the top of the double boiler from the simmering water and gradually add the beaten egg yolks, stirring constantly. Mix in the grated cheese, butter, sugar and salt. Beat the egg whites, in a small bowl, until round peaks are formed. Gently spread the beaten egg whites over the corn meal mixture then carefully fold together until just blended. Turn the mixture into the greased casserole dish. Bake at 375F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until a wooden pick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center of the dish. Serve piping hot with butter and maple syrup or honey.

NOTES : 'Graham flour' and Graham meal', invented by Sylvester Graham, an American doctor of the last century, are wholewheat products, containing the whole content of the wheat grain. Zofia Czerny's Polish Cookbook used 'ground wheat' and flour to make these rolls, and Lesley Chamberlain has had excellent results interpreting her instructions to mean a mixture of bulgur wheat and unbleached white flour, with or without a little extra bran. Whole wheat berries could also be used, though they need long soaking and chopping compared with bulgur, which is ready to go.

NOTES : Unique is the word for this loaf. Don't let the combination of ingredients scare you off, the texture created by the feta cheese combined with the smallest hint of cucumber makes this a wonderful bread. This is definitely a bread to accompany a hot meal. It's recommended with char-grilled marinated lamb chops or your favorite lamb kabobs.

Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Knead on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and satiny. Form the dough into a ball and place in an oiled bowl, rotating the dough to grease the surface all over. Cover with a dish towel and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in volume. Punch the dough down and allow to rise again. Punch the dough down again and form into a 9-inch (25 cm) round, placing the coin in the dough. Place on a greased baking sheet, cover with the towel, and allow to rise again until doubled in size. Brush with the egg and water mixture, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and decorate with the blanched almonds. Bake at 375F (190C) for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Makes one 9-inch (25 cm) loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sweet butter
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  grated orange rind
                        butter -- melted
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
  1                cup  milk
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  orange juice
  5 1/2           cups  sifted flour
                        red-dyed -- hard-boiled eggs
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar

In a small saucepan, combine the milk and butter over medium heat and scald. Stir until the butter melts, then pour into a mixing bowl. When lukewarm, sprinkle in the yeast, and with fingers or a heavy spoon gradually stir in the 1/2 cup sugar until it dissolves. Then add the salt, eggs 3 tablespoons of the orange juice, and the orange rind, stirring continuously, and gradually add half the flour until the mixture begins to bubble. Continue adding flour gradually by hand; the dough will be sticky, but should not be stiff. Flour your fingers lightly and knead for 15 minutes. Place the dough in a large buttered bowl, brush the dough with melted butter, cover, and place in a warm area to rise until doubled in bulk (approximately 2 to 3 hours).
Punch the dough down and divide into 2 parts. Divide each half into 3 parts and roll each into a long rope about 10" x 2". Braid the three ropes together; pinch to seal the ends if leaving long, or join together to form a long round loaf (see note below). Repeat with the other half of the dough to make a second tsoureki. Place in large baking pans or on a cookie sheet, cover, and let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2 hours).
Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by mixing the remaining orange juice, remaining sugar, and the almonds in a small bowl. Bake the tsourekia in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and with a pastry brush glaze the tops and sides of loaves. Return to the oven and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the color is a rich and shiny chestnut.
Note: If using the Easter eggs, tuck them into the center when you shape the loaves, leave until loaves have doubled and bake them with the loaf. After baking, though lovely, the eggs will be inedible. Also in some provinces, the tsoureki is formed with a large braid and a smaller one over it, making a much larger loaf requiring a longer baking time.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6       fluid ounces  water -- 105-115F
                        -- (40-45C)
  2 3/4           cups  bread flour -- more as needed
     1/4         ounce  active dry yeast
     1/4      teaspoon  granulated sugar -- or honey
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt -- plus more, to taste
  24                    calamata olives -- pitted and halved
  1           teaspoon  rosemary -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper -- fresh cracked, to
                        -- taste
  2             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil

1. Make a sponge by thoroughly combining the water, 1 3/4 cups of the flour, the yeast, and sugar or honey in a large bowl, or the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with a dough hook.

2. Cover and let sit in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The sponge should be thick, foamy, and bubbly with a strong yeasty aroma.

3. Blend in the remaining 1 cup flour and the salt.

4. Knead the dough until a smooth, elastic dough is formed.

5. Shape the dough into a ball and rub it lightly with olive oil, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size.

6. Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape into rounds and let rest while preparing the pans: Lightly coat two 8-inch round cake pans with olive oil and sprinkle generously with cornmeal. Gently tap out the excess.

7. Place a ball of dough in each pan. With your fingertips, push the dough out, working from the center, until it covers the pan. (If the dough sticks to your fingers, dip them in some olive oil.). Press the olives into the dough. Sprinkle with the rosemary and pepper.

8. Cover the pans with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

9. Preheat a grill to high heat. Place the pans on the upper shelf, cover the grill and cook the focaccia until done. While still warm, brush generously with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Cool on wire racks.

10. Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.

Although focaccia is traditionally baked in an oven, this recipe employs the use of a grill, enabling the bread to take on a hint of smoky smell and flavor.

Add ingredients to your bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Adjust liquid to give a medium dough in your machine. Too moist it might fall, too firm makes it hard to mix properly in the machines. Bake in normal mode, regular crust. This recipe can also be used for Rapid Bake or Timer modes. It is a good riser at this ratio.

~HISTORY~
An interesting grain to consider for bread use is called *Kamut*. It was brought to the US in '49. Plantings were gradually increased until 60 acres were planted in '88 in Big Sandy, Montana, when it received the registered trademark name Kamut, identifying the organically grown, pure, uncrossed strain. The '92 harvest produced on 4000 acres in Montana and Canada yielded 5 million pounds.

Genetically, Kamut belongs to the wheat family. Its slightly yellowish grains are larger and longer than wheat kernels. Kamut contains gluten and can be substituted in recipes calling for wheat. It has three advantages over wheat:
-Many with wheat allergies are enjoying Kamut without negative effects. -Whole grain Kamut flour produces lighter, more tender baked goods than whole grain wheat flours.
-Kamut has 3-5% more protein by weight than wheat.

More information can be found at the Kamut Association of North America's home page: http://icstech.com/~kamut/index.html

NOTES : Kamut makes this makes a slightly heavier loaf with a buttery, rich flavor. This is a moist, highly nutritional bread. It is moistened by the potato flakes and and flavored by the yogurt in addition to the spices.

Pharaoh's Phlour is Kamut (R) grain ground and used in a whole wheat manner. It has a higher protein content but is a bit lower in gluten than our regular wheat. It works well in yeast breads. It has a tender crumb and is lighter than a regular whole grain flour. It is available from Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods, 5209 SE International Way, Milwaukie, Oregon 97222. We find it in our health food section of various stores.

Legend says that Kamut grain was found in the pyramids of Egypt.

This one was developed in the Panasonic, I make it with or without herbs.

NOTES : I swore I wouldn't get another bread machine cookbook. Well, at $0.99 I couldn't resist, also name intrigued me. "Bread Machine Magic & More" No it's not from our favorite "Magic gals" Lois and Linda. But from a Rob & Holly Wanless. This is a supermarket special private press publication from "The American Cooking Guild" Haven't tried any of the recipes. Most are same old, same old. But one really caught my eye and want to try it. (I'm trying to get more soy into my diet)

I have a few variations in mind, one being a substitution of equal parts applesauce and lecithin granules for the shortening. Any other adjustments would be made after the first trial.

     1/4           cup  Honey
  1           teaspoon  Lemon juice

Granola cereal adds an interesting crunch to this bread. For best results, use either homemade granola or a store-bought brand that is low in fat and sugar.
Since there are so many different types of granola, the amount of water required in the recipe may vary.
Check the dough during the first kneading cycle to make sure it is not too dry.
All ingredients must be at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Add ingredients in the order specified in your bread machine owner's manual. Set bread machine on the basic/standard bread making setting. If possible, select light baking cycle.
If not, use the medium or normal setting. Do NOT use the programmable timer when making this bread since the recipe contains ingredients that can absorb the water prior to the start of the bread making process.
HINT: If dough appears too dry after kneading for the first couple of minutes, add additional water, no more than 1 tablespoon at a time, just until dough appears elastic Do NOT add too much water.

  1                cup  warm water
     1/4           cup  honey -- (I like clover here)
  2        Tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3               cups  white bread flour

  1               cups  Milk
  1               cups  Sugar
  6        tablespoons  Unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  Active dry yeast
  1              pinch  Sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115~)
  6               cups  unbleached -- (6 to 6 1/2)
                        -- all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Salt
  2          teaspoons  Baking powder
  4                     Eggs
  2        tablespoons  Pure anise extract
  1                     Egg -- beaten, glaze
  1        tablespoons  Fennel seeds -- sprinkling

*Anise extract, or anise flavoring, can be purchased at most health-food stores. Or rum can be substituted. In medium saucepan or microwave-proof bowl, combine milk, the 1 c sugar and butter. Heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Let mixture stand until warm, 105-115~. In small bowl, sprinkle yeast and pinch of sugar over warm water. Stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. In large bowl, with whisk, or in work bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, place 3 cups of the flour, salt and baking powder. Make a well in center and break the 4 eggs into the well. Gradually mix a few tablespoons of the flour into the eggs, add the anise extract and yeast and milk mixtures, and mix until a soft, smooth, sticky dough is formed, about 2 minutes. Add remaining flour, 1/2 c at a time, until a soft dough is formed that just clears the sides of the bowl, switching to a wooden spoon as necessary if making by hand. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 2 to 3 minutes, adding only 1 tb flour at a time as necessary to prevent sticking. It is important that this dough remain very soft, and springy. Place in greased deep container, turn once to coat the top and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise at cool room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 12 hours or as long as overnight. Gently deflate the dough and let rise again at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Gently deflate and divide the dough into 9 equal portions. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each portion into a rope 12" long. Using 3 ropes for each braid, braid ropes together, tuck under the ends and place each braid into a greased 9x5 loaf pan. Alternately place loaves on greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk or 1" above the rims of the pans, 45 minutes to 1 hour. 20 before baking, preheat oven to 350~. Brush tops with the egg glaze, taking care not to let it drip down the sides of the pan. Sprinkle with fennel seeds. Bake in center of the preheated oven until deep golden brown, 35-40 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately turn out onto a rack to cool completely. This bread freezes well. Yields three 9x5 or free-standing braided loaves each serving 10). 150 cal; 4 gr fat; 22% fat.

*  ( the original called for 4 Tbs. of extra-light olive oil: I use only 2 of whatever kind I have, and it's always come out perfect, but it's your call )

I love to add garlic ( I usually use chopped or minced though)!!

For "instant" garlic bread, you can add 1/2 to 1 Tsp. garlic powder, (or the same amount of garlic paste, if you have any) and a Tsp.or so of dried parsley ( go easy- unless it's St. Patrick's Day!) Bake on French bread cycle, medium , for an authentic style crisp crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
                        plus 2 egg yolks,
                        plus water to equal 1 cup
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rapid-rising or active dry yeast
     2/3           cup  golden raisins
                        Olive oil
                        Rosemary leaves

Makes 8 buns.

These are called pan de ramerino and are served on Maundy Thursday before Easter. Typical of Easter breads, these are rich with eggs. But they are also atypical in that they are rich with olive oil rather than butter. The oil gives the buns a beautiful texture to the crust. For this recipe, the buns must be shaped by hand and baked in the oven.

To mix the dough in the bread machine: Place egg and egg yolk into the measuring cup and add water to equal 1 cup. Pour mixture into the bread machine pan. In the order listed, add the olive oil, sugar, salt, 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, whole wheat flour and bread flour. Make an indentation in the dry ingredients and add the yeast.

Select Dough setting on bread machine, and press Start. If the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not soft to the touch but is very firm, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch.

Add the raisins when the machine signals it's time to add ingredients or when the cycle ends. The machine will stop when the dough is ready to shape and bake.

To shape and bake in the oven: Lightly grease a baking sheet or cover it with parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or lightly oiled surface. Punch the dough down, and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape each part into a ball, and place into the pan. Let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, 45 to 60 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Flatten each ball with your hand, and brush the tops with olive oil. Sprinkle with rosemary. Using a sharp knife or razor, slash each bun deeply in a tick-tack-toe design. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until the buns are golden. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.

(Should be butter). (J: Probably was unsalted - If you use salted butter, you could omit the salt called for in the recipe)

Knead all the ingredients into a smooth paste, keeping half the beaten egg for decorating.

Butter a pie pan (8 inches diameter) and press the dough into it. Brush the remaining egg on top. Decorate the top in squares with the back of a knife.

Bake 30 minutes in a moderate oven (350F) until golden brown. While still hot press the middle of the cake down with the back of a spoon. Cool and when firm to the touch turn out onto a wire rack. This cake should be soft inside (but done!) and hard at the outside.

NOTES : We spent most of the '70s in Holland. At that time most home cooking was done on a four burner stove-top as few Dutch houses had ovens. Cakes were bought from the baker, or grocer in the case of ontbijt koek.

An English-language book bought early in our stay was 'The Netherlands Cookbook' by Heleen A M Haverhout, and it includes the following recipes for ginger flavoured cakes - I hope they are similar to the ones you are looking for.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
                        -- PLUS water to equal 1 c.
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  4          teaspoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour
  1           teaspoon  rapid-rising or active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened

Makes 1 lb.  loaf.

The classic shape of this bread is a top hat with a fluted base. It's a showy one to include in a basket of breads. The brioche is definitely worth shaping by hand.

To mix the dough in the bread machine: Warm the eggs under hot tap water and crack into a measuring cup. Add the water (at room temperature) to the eggs; pour the mixture into the bread machine pan. Add the salt, sugar, whole wheat and bread flours. Make a small indentation in the dry ingredients, and add the yeast.

If only mixing the dough: Select the Dough cycle and press Start. (Then read on to "For either method.")

If mixing AND baking dough in bread machine: Select the Basic cycle and press Start.

For either method: Add the butter about 20 minutes into the cycle. If the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not soft to the touch but is very firm, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch.

To shape and bake in the oven: Lightly grease a fluted brioche pan, a 9-inch round cake pan or a 5-by 9-inch loaf pan. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or lightly oiled surface.

For the traditional brioche shape, punch the dough down and pinch off 1/4 of the dough. Shape the remaining dough into a round loaf. Place the loaf, smooth side up, in the brioche or cake pan. Make an indentation in the center of the loaf. Form the pinched-off portion into a teardrop shape, and place, pointed side down, into the hole in the loaf. Or press all of the dough into the loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush or spray the loaf with water. Bake 45 to 50 minutes, until a wood skewer inserted through the loaf comes out clean. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.

TESTED* by Sheri Beronja-Schlitt. "I was afraid the texture would be bad because of the lack of fat," she wrote. "I was wrong. The bread was flavorful and richly textured. The top was flat, rather than rounded. The crust was wonderful, lightly crispy. Our kids do not like the thick crust that develops in a bread maker -- this crust they ate. It was easy to prepare and tasty. Our family gobbled up the entire 1 1/2 pound loaf at one meal."

               Mature Flours, Bleached And Improved Flours

Excerpt from Madeleine Kamman's "New Making of a Cook"

>> One of my many great aunts, who lived on an isolated farm in Lorraine, France, made her own breads from flours produced by a rural miller and baked in the communal oven of her village. Every third month, she bought flour which she stored in huge barrels, lined up in order of purchase from left to right and stored in her cool, dry pantry. When the flour arrived from the miller it was almost as yellow as our present semolina. To aerate it, she would take a long paddle and stir the flour in each and every barrel once a week; until it had turned a wonderful, soft, and luminous ivory-white she would not use the flour. When a flour had reached the correct colour, she made a test loaf. If the loaf was compact and somewhat sticky when cooled and sliced, it was promptly relegated to the toasting tray and finally ended up in the crumb box. The flour had failed examination and had to wait longer to be used, until it could make "a true loaf of bread with big holes". Such flour, which is too young and not oxidized enough to develop a solid gluten structure, is called "bucky and was as much a feature of Colonial and Federral America as it was of the early twentieth-century French countryside.

"Aerating the flour" is an old-fashioned country expression for what we call nowadays letting the flour proteins oxidate. As my aunt's flour rested for weeks, often months, after going through the milling process, the yellow carotene-xantophyll pigments in the new flours were naturally bleached by light and oxygen to that lovely ivory-white and the sulfhydryl groups in the flour decreased appreciably, resulting in a bread dough that did not stretch and produced honest solid loaves of bread with big holes. The holes could be so big that I remember vividly passing one or two of my young fingers into them to see whether there was something in there; one day I found a small medal of the Holy Spirit.

The unbleached flour that we can buy in markets have been aged with the help of potassium bromate which accelerates their aging process. I prefer them to the bleached flour because their color is more natural and they really can bake a true loaf of bread, even if the holes in the bread are not as big as they need to be to host the Holy Spirit.

By law only benzoyl peroxide is allowed for the bleaching of flours in the US. It modifies the yellow color of young flours to that pallid white that is--say the flour people--desired by modern bakers.

Other improving agents can be used to accelerate the maturing of flours; most are gases which act immediately upon contact with the flour. Among them are chlorine gas used for cake flours, chlorine dioxide, nitrogen di- and tetra-oxide, and nytrosil chloride. Yet other conditioning agents are added to doughs in the making of commercial baked goods. The functions of these chemical may vary, but basically most of them bring on a reduction of thiol groups and encourage protein cross-linking.(For a more detailed explanation of thiols--check Harol McGee's "On Food and Cooking")

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water
  1              large  egg -- at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  bread flour
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa -- preferably
                        Dutch-process cocoa
  1         tablespoon  gluten
     3/4      teaspoon  instant espresso powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  dried orange peel
  1 1/2         ounces  bittersweet chocolate chips
  1 1/2      teaspoons  bread machine yeast

1. Place all ingredients in a bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Set crust on light, if your machine has options for crust settings, program for sweet bread and press the start key.

2. After the baking cycle ends, remove the bread immediately from the machine to a cooling rack. Cool to room temperature before slicing. Yields 1 loaf, about 10 slices.

Editor's note: Because of the inclusion of egg and milk, it is not advisable to use the delay cycle of the bread machine. Bread dough enhancers sold in many cookware shops work as well as gluten to ensure a light, fluffy loaf. Leftovers make great toast or positively sinful French toast. -- Karola Saekel, San Francisco Chronicle 02/10/99(Wed)

* Her Mexican Chocolate Bread, made start to finish in the bread machine, is an utterly delicious loaf, every bite and bit as good as the much more labor-intensive Bread With Three Chocolates made the conventional way. This melding of tradition and innovation is one of the strong points of this book, which does an admirable job of convincing readers that they can create a sturdy loaf of cracked-wheat bread for everyday sandwiches or zucchini madeleines, a sophisticated snack/ appetizer that begs to accompany a bottle of crisp Chardonnay.

     1/2           cup  Dried fruit -- (see notes)
                        -- (1/2 to 3/4)
     1/3           cup  Chopped Nuts -- (see notes)
  1 1/2            tsp  Salt
  3               TBSP  Milled Oats
  4               TBSP  Cracked Wheat cereal
  1 1/2            cup  Unbleached Bread flour
  2                cup  Whole grain wheat bread flour
  1               TBSP  Lecithin granules
  1 3/4            tsp  dry yeast -- (in dispenser)
                        ---
  2               TBSP  Molasses (unsulfured)
  1               TBSP  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
  14 1/2            oz  Filtered Water

Ingredients are for the largest loaf (usually fills the pan).

As in all Panasonic Bread machine recipes I've seen, the instructions I have followed say to put all dry ingredients other than the yeast in the "pan", add the liquids, install the "pan" in the machine, put the yeast in the dispenser, set the controls, and come back when kneading starts so you can adjust the water/flour balance as needed to ensure the correct dough consistency.

1. For fruit I have used raisins, zante currants, blueberries, cherries, cranberries, figs (diced), and combinations of several of those - all with equal success.

2. For nuts I have used chopped walnuts, slivered almonds, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, and mixtures of all of those - all with yummy results. Be careful of sunflower seeds and walnuts - many stores don't have enough turn-over in their stock and the seeds can develop a rancid taste if they are old.

3. For cracked wheat cereal I have also used 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10 grain cereals.

4. To add some more protein, you can replace any of the 2 TBSP flour ingredients with a like amount of any bean flour or you can just add bean flour if you ensure that you check the water when it starts to knead: I have used both white bean, garbanzo, and black bean flours up to as much as 4 TBSP per loaf. At 4 TBSP per loaf you get a detectable bean flavor, but at 2 TBSP level there's hardly a hint of bean flavor.

5. In attempts to produce a bread with a more pronounced anise flavor (especially good when using figs as fruit) I have also experimented with fennel seed and with adding 2 to 3 oz of some anise flavored liquor such as French Pernod or Greek Ouzo (mix with water to make the specified total amount of liquid). All of them give about the same level of a rather subtle flavor of anise in the baked bread. If you don't like anise flavor at all, just omit the anise seed.

6. I have experimented with malted barley and dry powdered milk: either or both of those ingredients give a loaf that is somewhat soggy (in my naivete I call it cake-like) and doesn't rise as well as when the ingredients are omitted.

Yeast can feed perfectly well on flour, and do not "require" refined sugar. They like Barley Malt very well; you can use the gooey crap or you can buy Barley Malt as Malted Barley flour. It is a dark-cream colored powder because it is an unrefined flour made from the sprouted (malted) barley grain. I use about 1 tsp. per loaf, pitched in right on top of my dry yeast. (However, I also use honey, so you may wish to experiment with more of the powder.)

If you are concerned about your yeast becoming sluggish and not lifting the heavier whole-grain loaves because they are working without the "supercharge" of sugar, you may find it effective to begin to experiment with "sponge" cookery. Take about 1/2 c of your water and about 1/2 c of your flour, (plus 1/2 tsp. of your barley malt, if desired) and stir this into a sponge--a separate "starter" for your bread. Inoculate this sponge with about 1/2 tsp. of your total intended yeast. (Most of my loaves use 1 or 1.5 tsp. TOTAL). Let this sponge work for an hour or 4 in a warm draft-free place, such as your oven with a pilot light, or with the electric bulb turned on. This will give even the most wimpy yeast a nice "head-start" on a heavy-grain loaf.

A special note, I have explicitly stated that you should not use ALL your yeast in your sponge. This contradicts the "old-fashioned" methods of sponge-making. I have done so because I have found that the newer yeasts, which have been recently created to respond to the comparatively brief rising times of bread-machines, will sometimes exhaust themselves before they have done their "real" work of raising the actual loaf in the machine. Again, *Sometimes*, but not always. By holding back some of the yeast and adding it to the machine along with all the remaining ingredients--after your sponge has developed--you work your machine-cycle from a "known" starting point. The yeast are working from two different starting points. The new yeast work with their customary explosive vigor, while the slightly older yeast have moved into a "steady-state" population which is reproducing constantly, but perhaps not explosively. Your newer yeast give the required ABM "shove" but the older yeast give you a larger basic yeast population and a more even distribution of the CO2. If you aren't using an ABM, my method is unnecessarily complicated.

I recommend sponge cookery over the simple expedient of adding more yeast because the flavor of the two sorts of loaves is very different; less yeast grown over more time gives a nicer texture and a richer flavor to the bread, while more yeast pitched in suddenly tends to give a flatter flavor with a distinctly less pleasant "yeasty" or "musty" taste and smell. I suspect that if you are eliminating refined sugar, the flavor of your loaves is going to become more important to you very soon.

Some folks keep a sponge going in the refrigerator all the time, and use that as a "helper" but you may not wish to do this. Yeast mutate rather quickly, and move away from the lovely basic strain we now know as commercial bread yeast. Also, wild yeasts can creep in (contaminate), and then you must basically have the luck of a lottery winner to have a good taste. This is the foundation of sour-dough cookery, and not all wild strains are equally desirable. So, if you start your sponge fresh every time, and give it an hour's "head-start" you can accomplish much of what is desirable in a starter without the difficulties of what is not desirable in a starter.

I also strongly recommend you experiment with varieties of yeast. I find SAF yeast (available through King Arthur) is very different from Fleischmann's or RedStar. It gives me a much better rise. This may be because they have already added ascorbic acid. If I can't get SAF I will take RedStar over Fleischmann's every time. I experimented with these and several other yeasts, and found Fleischmann's had a tendency to fail completely more often than I will tolerate. It just plain arrives dead from the grocery store--if you proof it side by side with other yeasts you see it has a very different vigor.

Increasing the gluten content of your loaf may improve structure and so, give you a better lift on a heavy loaf as well.

Finally, if you still find that your yeast must be stimulated more than barley malt will provide, add some lemon-juice (1/2 to 1 tsp.) to give them ascorbic acid, and add just a pinch of ground ginger. Both of these are well-known as yeast stimulants.

I received many replies to my plea for help with using alternate sweeteners in breads.

Here's a summary of what I learned:

1) Yeast breads work just fine without the use of any sweetener; however, you do need to allow more rising time so the yeast can grow. Several suggested using the "sponge" method or sticking with sourdough starters.

2) Some reported much success using barley malt , brown rice syrup, or maple syrup in place of refined sugar. As suspected, yeast seems to thrive on these sweeteners just as well as on sugar and honey.

3) The herbal sweetener, Stevia, won't offer any good food source for the yeast, but it is fine to use if you want sweeter bread. It will hold up in cooking. If you use it, then treat the dough as if you added no sweetener.

4) Concentrated fruit juices work well, too.

                        Late evening first day:
  1                cup  oatmeal -- blended until
                        coarse meal
  1                cup  wheat germ
                        -- raw or toasted -- (your preference)
  6               cups  flour
                        -- (1/2 all-purpose
                        -- 1/2 whole wheat is a variation)
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  active dry yeast
                        -- (this is not an error
                        -- this is all you need)
  3               cups  tepid water
                        -- (should barely feel warm)
                        ---
  1         tablespoon  medium-to-hot pepper powder -- (1 to 3)
                        -- or flakes -- etc.

* put a cup of oatmeal in blender and blend till it is like coarse meal, dump it in a large bowl

Note: if you use a high gluten flour and have smaller loaf pans, divide the dough into thirds. I use King Arthur flour 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 white whole wheat which does not rise quite as much. The flavor of this bread is enhanced by the lengthy proofing. Also, it is very handy for people who do not have a warm place to proof the dough,(for instance have an electric oven) it works very well at temps around 65-70 which is the way I keep my home.

Mix well, scrape the dough out onto floured board, knead for a few minutes or so, till the dough feels silky. (3 minutes ought to do it) Wear latex gloves if you have added pepper powder.Roll in flour, put back into the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave it setting anywhere, it doesn't have to be in a warm place,

go to bed.

Next morning punch the dough down, divide in half. put each half into a greased loaf pan (large) or shape into rounds or long rolls and place on a greased baking sheet. You can add dried fruit, nuts or spices at this point, pat the dough out flat, sprinkle with the additions, roll, pinch along the seam, tuck in the ends and place in pan or on sheet with the seam side down.

Cover the pans or loaves with a cloth and forget about them for the entire day. Go to work, go shopping, read a book, whatever. When you get home, turn the oven on to 400 degrees F. Brush the top of the loaves with milk or spray with one of the aerosol oils, plain or flavored.
At this point you can also sprinkle seeds over the top. place in the oven and bake for about 40 minutes.

for a crustier loaf you can spritz water on the floor of the oven for steam.

  3          teaspoons  Active dry yeast

SUCCESS HINTS: For added texture, add the oats after the first knead
 or at the beep on the fruit and nut cycle. For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats on top of the loaf after the final rise. Instant oatmeal doesn't work, but quick-cooking oats do. This recipe can be made with the regular, rapid, or delayed time bake cycles.

You can add the raisins and nuts at the beginning of the cycle or at the "beeps" You may need to add more water. If the machine seems to strain to knead the dough, add a little more water. Use the SWEET BREAD cycle, as the sugar and raisins make the crust brown quickly. You can place a piece of foil on top to brown the top crust a bit more.

NOTES : We spent most of the '70s in Holland. At that time most home cooking was done on a four burner stove-top as few Dutch houses had ovens. Cakes were bought from the baker, or grocer in the case of ontbijt koek.

An English-language book bought early in our stay was 'The Netherlands Cookbook' by Heleen A M Haverhout, and it includes the following recipes for ginger flavoured cakes - I hope they are similar to the ones you are looking for.

Mix dry ingredients in large bowl. Chop in butter until fine crumbly texture. Mix liquids together separately then add to flour mixture and form a dough, not dry but not too moist (you may need a little flour or a little orange juice if needed). Knead dough gently until smooth - only for 2-3 minutes, at most. Dough will get tough if over kneaded.

Roll out on floured surface to generous inch-thick, cut out with round pastry cutter (about 8) or slice wedge style (6) out of a round. Top with cream (dab) and sugar.

Bake at 375F for 20-22 minutes or until lightly golden brown and firm in center. One wedge: 417 cals, 19g fat, 41% cff.

  4               cups  all-purpose flour

  1              large  egg yolk -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream -- for egg wash

(Italian fruitcake  Makes 3 small loafs)

1. To make the sponge, warm a small bowl by rinsing it with hot water. Pour in 1/3 cup warm water, and sprinkle 1 package yeast on top. Let stand until yeast has dissolved. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand for 30 minutes, or until doubled.

2. Sprinkle remaining yeast over warm milk. Let stand until dissolved.

3. Beat together sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla. Mix in yeast-milk mixture. Add sponge, and stir until well-incorporated.

4. Combine butter and remaining 3 1/2 cups flour until crumbly. Slowly pour in egg mixture, and beat on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until dough is elastic-looking and long strands form. Beat in fruit and zest. Turn dough into an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled, 2 to 3 hours.

5. Fold down bags to form a 3-inch cuff. Brush inside and out with melted butter.

6. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured board, and knead a few times to deflate. Divide dough into 3 pieces. Roll each into a ball, and drop into prepared bags. Place bags on a baking sheet about 4 inches apart, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Leave in a warm place to rise until doubled again, about 2 hours.

7. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Carefully cut an "X" in the top of each loaf with oiled scissors. Brush tops lightly with egg wash. Place baking sheet in bottom third of oven. After 10 minutes, lower heat to 375 degrees. Bake for 30 more minutes; if tops get too brown while baking, cover with foil. Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into centers comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.

                        -----FILLING-----
  6        Tablespoons  Unsalted butter -- cut into 1"
  1 1/2           Cups  Dark Brown Sugar
     1/3           Cup  Corn Syrup
  3        Tablespoons  Molasses
     1/4           Cup  Heavy Cream
  2               Cups  Pecan Halves -- toasted

Place all dough ingredients in the machine. Program for knead and first rise and press start. At the end of the final cycle, transfer the dough to a well-oiled bowl, cover it with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours. Generously butter a 12 cup bundt pan. Place the butter, sugar, corn syrup and molasses in a 2 quart saucepan set over medium heat. Allow the mixture to come to a boil. Cook 2 minutes at full boil. Remove from the heat and add the cream. Stir in combine and then immediately stir in the pecans. Continue to mix until all the pecans are covered.

Pour a third of the filling into the prepared pan and set aside the rest to cool while you prepare the dough. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 20 x 9 inch rectangle. Place the prepared pan nearby. Pour the rest of the filling down the length of the dough and use a metal spatula to quickly spread it to within 2" of the edges. Flip one long side of the dough over the middle, then the other, to form a long roll. Quickly lift the roll and place it in the pan so that the ends overlap slightly.

Cover the pan with lightly oiled plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375F. with the rack in the center position. Bake for 20 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350F. and bake it another 20 to 25 minutes. If the top is getting too brown, cover it loosely with foil. Put a cake rack over a large plate. Remove cake from oven and turn over onto the rack. Scoop up any filling that drips off and place it back on cake. Once filling has cooled, remove the cake to a serving plate.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     extra large egg
     1/4           cup  dry vermouth or dry white wine
  1              clove  garlic
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  pesto sauce
     1/3           cup  plus 2 tbs water
  3               cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2 1/2      teaspoons  yeast
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- (see note)

NOTE: Place all the ingredients except the pine nuts in the machine, program for RAISIN BREAD, and press start. When the beeper sounds, add the nuts.

Pesto is a pungent Italian sauce made from ground-up basil, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese. It used to be available only in the summer when fresh basil is plentiful. Now you can buy it in most grocery stores bottled, in the refrigerator case, or even in a tube. Home made may be the best, but store bought is just fine.

                              Pizza Dough #8

                Dough Cycle                     Pizza And Calzones


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Water -- (3/4)
  2               Tbsp  Olive Oil -- (1 Tbsp)
  2                tsp  Salt -- (1 tsp)
  2                tsp  Sugar -- (1 tsp)
  4               cups  Flour -- (2 cups)
  4                tsp  machine yeast -- (2 tsp)

Here's the recipe: Measurements are for a large batch, with small in brackets. The Oster makes a 2 pound loaf, so you might want to go with the small, depending on your machine:

Add ingredients according to your machine's specifications; using dough cycle If you will be using right away, let rest for 5 minutes under plastic wrap before shaping
If freezing, simply remove dough from pan, divide as necessary, wrap well or use a good freezer bag, squeezing out all the air before sealing.

A large batch will make two 12-14 inch pizzas, a small batch will make one.

Option: Add 3-4 Tbsp dried onion and/or 1-2 minced cloves of garlic to make focaccia. Brush with additional olive oil mixed with more garlic and some dried rosemary and basil, sprinkle with parmesan. You can also press olives or sun-dried tomatoes into the crust before baking - at 400 degrees F. for about 15 minutes.

NOTES : I have had great luck with the pizza dough recipe that came with my Oster: I make a large batch, cut it in half and freeze the dough until I need it. Defrost the dough in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before shaping - knead it, then let it rest, then shape it, and, depending on how thick you like your dough, let it rise in the pan. (I like mine thin, so add the topping as soon as it's been shaped). A couple of things that I've learned about home-baked pizza: get your oven good and hot, and don't overdo the toppings. 10 minutes later you'll be thinking about starting your own pizza business, the results are so good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
  1               tbsp  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  italian seasoning
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  parmesan cheese
  1                cup  semolina flour
  2               cups  flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  SAF yeast

Place all the ingredients in bread machine according to your directions. Put on dough cycle. If you'd like to make up the dough ahead of time (like a boboli type crust), shape on pizza pan, sprinkle with some more parmesan, and bake at 375 for 8-10 minutes until very lightly browned. Let cool and freeze for later use. When you put the toppings on you only have to bake until the toppings are bubbly and hot. I have made this recipe in the Zojirushi machine. Yours may use different amounts of liquid/flour measurements.

                        Overnight sponge:
  1                cup  water
     3/4      teaspoon  dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- approximately
                        -----
                        Dough:
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                     generous tablespoon honey
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  stoneground cornmeal
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour

Sponge: In a small bowl, mix water and yeast and let stand a minute. Add flour to make a thick glop. Dump this mixture in the bread machine and close the cover.

Dough: The next day, add water, salt, sugar, olive oil, cornmeal and flour.

Bread machine: Add ingredients to machine bread pan in order given or as per manufacturer's instructions. Set to 'dough' mode. Remove from machine.

Food processor:
Place water, sugar, salt, shortening and olive oil in bowl of food processor and pulse to dissolve sugar and salt. Add yeast, bread flour and all purpose flour. Process until a soft ball forms. Remove from machine.

Dough hook:
Place water, sugar, salt, shortening and olive oil in bowl of mixer and dissolve sugar and salt. Stir in yeast, bread flour and all purpose flour and knead with dough hook to form a soft, but not-too sticky dough (about 8 minutes). Remove from machine.

By Hand:
In this case, use only all-purpose flour. Place water, sugar, salt, shortening and olive oil in bowl and dissolve sugar and salt. Stir in yeast, all purpose flour and knead to form a soft, but not-too sticky dough (about 8-l0 minutes).

Let rise all day (6-8 hours). When ready to use, deflate dough gently and proceed with your favorite pizza recipe.

Most bread machines do not have a way to time delay their 'dough' cycle. Wouldn't it be nice to have pizza dough ready when you arrive home from work or at the end of a busy Saturday errand run? If you have ready made dough, pizza is a snap. Here is a special method - a low-yeast, slow-rising dough develops at a leisurely pace while you are away. Hours later, it is ready - and just right. The bonus is that this method gives you better tasting and better textured dough anyway, due to the slow rise.

                        Cabbage leaves
                        oil

The Polish food historian Maria Lemnis wrote in the early 1980s: 'The wheat-rye breads of long ago, baked in leaves of cabbages or horseradish, the so-called peasant breads, are an exquisite delicacy.'

The cabbage-leaf baking method, whereby the dough is contained in oiled cabbage leaves, was practised (sic) as widely afield as Transylvania and Romania. It produces a golden brown crust. The technique can be applied to any firm white (or brown) dough.

Place a large oiled leaf in the bottom of the baking tin, put the dough in a ball on top and cover it with more oiled leaves until it is completely covered. Leave it to rise, then bake at the usual temperature, still covered with the leaves.

* (not pillsbury rye-wheat, but their medium rye or a health food store or king arthur rye)

Raisins should be placed in at the beginning, don't nead to be whole, mostly for
flavor.
Will be a smaller, dense loaf. A t of gluten might help and I definitely add 2 T of lecithin granules to help it stay fresh, it doesn't do too well in that department. But on the other hand, we cut it thick and it doesn't last too long either.

                          Red Sage Quinoa Bread

Recipe By     :Mark Miller - Coyote Cafe

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  quinoa
  2 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  lukewarm water
  2        tablespoons  canola oil -- (or corn oil)
  2        tablespoons  lukewarm milk
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  3               cups  bread flour
  3        tablespoons  dried rubbed sage
  12                    sage leaves, fresh -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chile molido
                        -- (fresh gr pure chili powder)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast

Place the quinoa and 2 1/2 cups water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the quinoa expands and becomes fluffy. Drain the quinoa and place in a mixing bowl; there should be about 2 cups of cooked quinoa. Set aside.

Combine 1 cup water, the milk, and oil in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer or in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture, stir in, and let sit for 2 minutes.

Add the cooked quinoa and dry ingredients. Mix with the dough hook (or knead by hand) for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the dough appears silky and resilient.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until approximately doubled in volume.

Punch the dough down, recover with wrap, and let rise again in a warm place for 30 minutes.

Place a baking stone on the middle rack in the oven and preheat to 400°F. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and cut into 2 equal pieces.

Grease two loaf pans or generously dust a baking sheet with whole wheat flour. Shape the dough into oblong loaves or divide it into 14 to 16 rolls. Place the loaves in the prepared loaf pans (or place the rolls on the baking sheet), cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap, and let rise again in a warm place for 30 minutes.

Uncover the loaves (or rolls) and, using a spray bottle, spritz them with water and lightly dust with rye flour. Make 2 or 3 diagonal slashes in the tops of the loaves with a serrated knife to allow the dough to expand in the hot oven.

Using the spray bottle, spritz the oven walls with water. Work quickly so the oven does not lose heat. Set the loaf pans or baking sheet on the hot stone.

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (20 to 25 minutes for rolls). The bread is done when the crust is crisp and dark brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let the bread cool in the pans or on the baking sheet for 10 minutes.

Transfer the loaves (or rolls) to a rack and cool before cutting. Makes 2 loaves or 14 to 16 rolls.

Poster's note: In the book, the following directions are given for making in the bread machine but since the quinoa, when cooked, amounts to 2 cups, I cannot see how all the ingredients would fit in a normal sized bread machine.

Bread Machine Instructions: Combine the ingredients, except the fresh sage, in the bread pan in the order specified by the manufacturer's instructions.
Process on the sweet or raisin setting. Add the fresh sage at the beeps. Recipe from Mark Miller's Book - Flavored Breads

NOTES : This bread is named after the Red Sage, the Washington, DC, sister restaurant of Coyote Cafe. Red sage really does exist, although it is relatively rare and not easily available to the home cook. It's bright red flowers look like a miniature version of an Indian paintbrush.

NOTES : The following recipe is in the recent edition of Canadian Living magazine. I made them last week and they taste great, just like at the shop where the recipe is from. It makes 8 large rolls. I only scanned the ABM method although there were instructions for making them all by hand.

These classic white rolls shaped into a pretty- ring are inspired by Didier Julien, owner of Julien's Pastry Shop in Chester, N.S., which ranks. among the finest shops in the country.

Use dough cycle. Shape into pan rolls. Bake in a 400F oven until golden brown, about 18 minutes.
Remove and brush immediately with butter for a soft crust. I adapted the following recipe from the 1986 Betty Crocker, using evaporated milk instead.
This has worked well with semolina flour, except the rolls were denser due to lesser gluten.

George: "Here is a bread that you will probably not find on your grocers shelves, though it deserves to be. If it is hearty enough to eat through a Siberian winter we think it will surely ease the chilly months ahead. Very similar to Pumpernickel Bread, Russia Black Bread is a full-flavored, dark bread that stands up to strong flavors such as sardines and smoked turkey. The Postum intensifies the flavor of the bread and is sold in natural food stores and many supermarkets."

>From http://www.mysupermarket.com/Netcenters/Baking/brdmake.html Home Bread Maker

Postum is a coffee substitute, mixture of molasses, bran and wheat. Possible substitutes: ground Grape-Nuts; toasted bran flakes, ground; instant caffeine-free coffee such as Kava or Sanka.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  dry yeast
  3 1/2           cups  bread flour
                        OR all-purpose flour
  4               cups  pumpernickel flour
                        OR medium rye flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  whole bran cereal
  2        tablespoons  caraway seeds -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  instant coffee
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds -- crushed
  2 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
  1              ounce  unsweetened chocolate (1 square)
     1/4           cup  shortening
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch (mixed in 1/2 cup cold water)

Baking Pans or Sheet: Two 8" cake pans, greased; or, if the dough is fairly stiff and will hold shape, use 1 baking sheet, greased or Teflon.

By Hand or Mixer, 20 minutes: In a large mixing or mixer bowl mix the yeast, 1 cup white and 1 cup pumpernickel or rye flour, salt, bran cereal, caraway, instant coffee, onion powder, and fennel.

In a saucepan, combine the water, vinegar, molasses, chocolate, and shortening. Place over low heat. When the liquid is warm (the chocolate and shortening need only be soft), add to the dry ingredients. Beat at medium speed with the flat beater for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally.

Add 1 cup white flour and 1 cup rye flour. Beat for 2 minutes, or about 100 strokes with a wooden spoon. Stir in 2 more cups rye flour and enough white flour to make a soft dough.

Work the flour into the dough first with a wooden spoon or dough hook, and then turn out to work with your fingers and hands.

Rest 15 minutes: Before kneading, cover the dough with the bowl and lest it rest for 15 minutes.

Kneading 8 minutes: Knead by hand or with the mixer dough hook until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is sticky, dust it and your hands with flour. Scrape away any sticky film that forms on the work surface, and dust it afresh. The dough should pull away and clean the sides of the bowl.

First Rising 1 Hour: Place the dough in a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and leave at room temperature until puffy and doubled in bulk, 1 hour.( If prepared with the new fast-rising yeast at the recommended higher temperatures, reduce the rising time by half.)

Shaping 10 minutes: Punch down the dough with the fingers and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut the dough into 2 pieces and let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape each piece into a ball, flatten slightly, and place either in the cake pan or on a baking sheet.

Second Rising 45 minutes: Cover with waxed paper and leave at room temperature until the loaves have doubled in bulk, 45 minutes.

Preheat: Preheat the oven to 350F about 20 minutes before baking.

Baking 350F 1 hour: Bake for about 1 hour, or until a metal skewer inserted in the center of a loaf comes out dry and clean. When tapped on the bottom crust, it will sound hard and hollow.

Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. In a small saucepan heat the cornstarch and cold water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils. Hold the boil for 1 minute, stirring all the while.

When the bread is baked, remove from the oven and brush the loaves with the cornstarch mixture. Place back in the oven for about 3 minutes, or until the glaze has set. (If using a convection oven, reduce the heat 40F.)

Final Step: Remove the bread from the oven, turn from the baking sheet or pan, and place on a metal rack to cool.

  2                Tsp  Ground Sea Salt

In a small bowl, combine water and yeast, let stand 5 min. (yeast will bubble slightly). In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and yeast. With an electric mixer on med speed, knead dough 10 - 12 min, until a soft, smooth dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead dough into an evenly shaped ball. Place dough in mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 - 2 hrs. Preheat oven to 425F. Place dough on a lightly floured surface and press flat to form 1 round loaf. Stretch sides of dough downward and tuck under, rotating the ball to form a tight shape. Transfer to floured La Cloche baker and dust top with flour. Cover with lid and let rise until doubled, 30 - 40 min. Using a serrated knife, make 3 shallow X's on the top of the loaf. Bake about 1 hr. Loaf should be golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.

         Sauteed Garlic Spread (As Alternative To Roasted Garlic)

                        lots of peeled garlic
                        good oil

Bob, another garlic lover, replied:

Below is a copy of a posting that I saved a long time ago. I LOVE roasted garlic, you get the flavor but not the "bite" so you can use MUCH more and get much more flavor. I like it as a spread for bread, but now may try this recipe and use it in the bread. Thanks.

An effective substitute for roast garlic: Peel vast quantities of garlic, put in a pan with tasty oil (we use mid-grade Spanish olive oil, mostly) to cover, bring to gentle boil, simmer until garlic can be pierced with a skewer and is lightly browned.

Drain. The oil can be re-used for several batches, becoming richly garlic flavored oil suitable for salads and light sauteing. The garlic can be frozen, and will keep several weeks in the fridge. If you're feeling particularly industrious, nip off the roots and tips with a sharp knife before cooking, and puree after. Roast garlic puree acts both adds flavor, and acts as a thickener in sauces. We put it in or on practically everything, and have served it, seasoned with salt and either a bit of dried wild mushroom powder or French olive paste, as a dip.

  2               cups  bread flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  yeast -- (one package)

A true sourdough starter is nothing more than the flour and milk or water which sits at room temperature for several days and catches live yeast bacteria from the air. Most starter recipes today include yeast as an original ingredient as it is much easier and less time consuming. In addition, many sourdough bread recipes also indicate usage of yeast itself as it does provide a higher rising, lighter loaf.

A sourdough starter should be kept in a glass or plastic bowl which has a tight fitting lid. Use a bowl instead of a jar as you can "feed" your starter right in the bowl easily.

To make your starter, mix together:

2 cup lukewarm milk 2 cup bread flour 2 1/2 tsp yeast (one package)

Mix the starter with an electric or hand held mixer on the lowest setting. Cover your starter and place in a warm, draft-free location for 4 to 7 days, gently stirring it once a day. You may notice that the mixture bubbles and in some cases it may even overflow the bowl. This is an indication that you have a healthy starter which should simply be poured off and discarded.

If your starter ever changes colors, to purple, for example, discard and start another one.

After allowing your starter to sit for 4 to 7 days it is ready to be used. Take out whatever portion your recipe calls for and put into the machine as you would any liquid ingredient. After removing a portion from the starter, the starter must be "fed". Simply add equal portions of milk or water and flour as was used. For example, if you used 1 cup of starter, replace it with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of bread flour.

Some Hints on feeding your starter: always use the same kind of flour. If you used bread flour in your original starter, use bread flour to feed it. Also, alternate between milk and water for each feeding. Since your original liquid ingredient was milk, the first liquid feeding should be with water. If you forget which you used last, that's okay, but try to alternate at least every other time. After feeding your starter, let it sit at room temperature for about one day and then refrigerate.

Many cookbooks suggest stirring the starter once a day even when being refrigerated; I find that it is not necessary. You must, however, use a portion of the starter at least once a week. If you choose not to bake sourdough breads that often, then remove a cup of your starter and feed it as though you used some during the week. If this is not done, your starter will turn rancid and have to be replaced. Should you be away on vacation or otherwise not able to tend to the starter, freeze it. Upon your return, thaw it in the refrigerator and then remove a portion and feed it as soon as you are able.

You may be thinking that this sounds too complicated, but it really is not, nor is the starter overly fragile.

After allowing the starter to mellow a little by sitting in the refrigerator and using only once a week, it and the breads became more sour.

Another hint is to put the bread in on the timer cycle for early morning baking. The milk put in the night before adds a little more sour taste. If the bread is getting too sour for you, feed with water more often than milk.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         Tablespoon  dry yeast
  2 1/2           Cups  warm water
  2          Teaspoons  sugar -- or honey
  2 1/2           Cups  flour

Combine ingredients. Let it ferment for five days, stirring daily. May be kept indefinitely in the refrigerator, although it's best to use it regularly to replenish the starter. If liquid rises to top during storage, just stir back in. Many sourdough recipes use a sponge method of rising, using the starter as the leavening agent and mixing about 1 cup for every 6 cups flour and 4-6 cups water to make the sponge. This ferments overnight at room temp. You then replace the starter used from the new mixture, add oil, salt and enough flour to make the dough. Knead, cut, form into loaves and allow to rise for two hours, then bake (425=B0 for 20 minutes, turn down to 375=B0 and bake for another 1 to 1-14 hours, brushing loaves with water before each oven entry).

For English muffins, instead of cutting for loaves, roll dough out to @1/4" thick and cut into rounds. Let rise for an hour or so, until doubled, then bake slowly on an ungreased griddle, starting with high heat and reducing heat to brown slowly for each batch, baking 5-6 minutes on each side. I like to roll mine out on corn meal, which gives them sort of a pro finish. They freeze well, but you may want to fork split them first

(CONTINUED) "In a couple of hours you may see tiny bubbles appear on the surface. If so, cheer your brew on by keeping it warm and covered overnight. In the morning, celebrate by making sourdough pancakes (which you'll find ...in our "King Arthur
Flour 200th Anniversary Cookbook"). They are delicious and quick. Give the remaining starter another feeding, let it sit for 12 more hours to ensure its reawakened vigor before you tuck it back in the frig. Then quietly heave a sigh of relief and congratulate yourself on your rescue." How to Decide if You Need to Start Over (groan):

"If your sourdough begins to mold or develop a peculiar color or odor instead of a "clean, sour aroma," give a sigh, throw it out and, if you're patient, start again. Along with the vital yeasts, you may have inadvertently nurtured a strain of bacteria that will not be wonderful in food. This happens very infrequently so don't let this possibility dissuade you from a sourdough adventure."
 Starter Variations:

"Here are some variations on the basic flour/liquid/yeast combination that will produce sourdough starters with different personalities.

*Substitute 1 cup of stone ground whole wheat flour for 1 of the unbleached all-purpose flour.

*For tap water, substitute water from cooking potatoes. It contains nutrients which any kind of yeast loves and along with making the yeast happy, it creates great flavor in bread.

*Substitute buttermilk for tap water.

(CONTINUED) Troubleshooting

Feeding Without Baking: "If you have been busy or away, you can always feed your starter without baking anything. Stir the mixture together, take out and discard 1 cup of starter and replenish as above, stirring in 1 cup water and 1 cup flour. (Or instead of discarding the starter you removed, ask a neighbor if he or she would be interested in adopting a starter of his/her very own.) Let the resuscitated mixture sit at room temperature for 12 hours or so before you return it to the refrigerator."

Treating a "Sluggish" Starter: "If you feel that your starter is just not "up to snuff," dissolve a teaspoon of yeast in the cup of water you mix into the starter when you feed it. (If you live in an area where water is chlorinated, let some sit out overnight to allow the chlorine to dissipate to preclude any interference with the development of the sourdough micro-organisms)."

Sweetening a Starter: "If your starter becomes too sour, take out 1 cup, dispose of the remainder, and add 2 cups of each of flour and water to refreshen it."

Increasing Your Starter: "If you want to grow a large amount of starter to give some to a friend or to do a lot of baking, simply increase the amount you feed it."

Resuscitating a Neglected Starter: "If your sourdough starter has sat in the refrigerator months beyond the point of health, give it a fighting chance for survival before you throw it out. A little warmth and a good meal of strong, high energy carbohydrates may be all it needs to get it off and running again."

"The layer of liquid on the surface will probably be very dark, making it look as if the starter must surely have expired. Quell your fear, wrestle the top off the jar and give it a sniff. If it smells the way it should, though exceptionally sour, it may just be sitting there in a dormant state waiting to be fed. The only way to know is to give it a meal."

"Blend it back together and pour it into a glass or ceramic bowl. (Take this opportunity to give its jar a good wash.) As the starter will probably be quite thin, mix in 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of water to nourish and thicken it. Leave the bowl out on the counter where it will be warm and visible."

The following information comes from King Arthur Flour "A Short Course in Cooking With & Keeping the Elusive Wild Yeast".

What is a Sourdough Starter?

"A sourdough starter is a wild yeast living in a batter of flour and liquid. Yeasts are microscopic fungi related distantly to mushrooms. There are many varieties of these tiny organisms around us everywhere. Wild yeasts are rugged individualists which can withstand the most extreme of circumstances.

Some will make delicious loaves of bread; others will create yogurt and cheese out of milk; still others will turn the juices of grains and fruit into beer and wine."

"Active dry yeast, the kind we can buy in packets at our grocer's, is a domesticated descendant of these wild relatives, one which has been grown for flavor, speed of growth and predictability. But domestic yeasts are much more fragile and can't be grown at home without eventually reverting to their original wild state."

"If you can imagine a world without any packets of active dry yeast, you can imagine how important your sourdough starter would be to you. Without it, you would be doomed to some pretty awful eating. It is no wonder that sourdough starters were treasured, fought over, and carried to all ends of the earth. To the early prospectors, it was such a valued possession (almost more than the gold they were seeking), that they slept with it on frigid winter nights to keep it from freezing. (Ironically, freezing won't kill a sourdough starter although too much heat will.)"

Fermentation (or the Microscopic Magic of Yeast): "As we mentioned above, yeast is a microscopic fungus. As it feeds on the natural sugars in grain, it multiplies and gives off carbon dioxide (just as we do when we breathe). This invisible activity of yeast is called fermentation. When you make bread with wheat, by kneading the long elastic strands of wheat protein (called gluten) into an elastic mesh, you create traps for these carbon dioxide bubbles causing the dough to expand as if it contained a million tiny balloons."

                        *****

(CONTINUED) Storing Your Starter:

"Once your sourdough pet is cold and relatively dormant, it can survive quite a long time between "feedings." It is certainly not as demanding as children, or more traditional pets, but it isn't happy just sitting for months on end like a packet of commercially dried yeast either."

"Freezing: You may be able to ignore your starter for a month or even much longer, but if you know you're going to be away for a time, you can store it (unlike children or pets) in the freezer. You may want to transfer it to a plastic container first as it will expand as it freezes. When you are ready to use it again, give it a day to revive, feed it a good meal, give it another day to build up an armada of fresh, new wild siblings and it will be ready to go to work."

"Drying: An alternative storage method is to dry your starter by spreading it out on a piece of heavy plastic wrap or waxed paper. Once it's dry, crumble it up and put it in an airtight container. Store it some place cool, or, to be safe, in the freezer. To reactivate the dried starter, grind it into small particles with a hand cranked grinder, a blender or a food processor. Pour 1 to 1 1/2 cups of warm water (what feels comfortable on your wrist) into a glass or ceramic bowl. Stir in and dissolve a tablespoon of sugar or honey. This isn't necessary but it gives the yeast an easy "first course." Blend in an equal amount of flour and dried starter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and watch for small telltale bubbles which should begin to appear on the surface within a few hours. Once you see them you'll know it's alive and well. Let it continue to feed and grow for a further 12 hours before you cover and refrigerate it."

How to Remove Some Starter for Baking:

"With a spoon or wire whisk, blend the liquid back into the starter and then measure out the quantity required by your recipe. Replace the amount taken with equal amounts of flour and water. Since many recipes are based on using 1 cup of starter, you would return to your starter pot, 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water. (This actually makes 1 1/3 cups more starter but you can adjust the amount whenever you want.) As you did when you first fed your starter, let it sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to give the yeast a chance to "feed" and multiply before you chill it again."

(Continued) How to Feed & Care for Your Sourdough Starter:

"Keeping a sourdough starter is somewhat like having a pet because it needs to be fed and cared for. But its requirements are simple and not time consuming. Baking with sourdough is also a simple process. All it takes is a little planning and timing. The results are so satisfying, you'll grow to treasure your invisible pet the way our ancestors did."

"When you receive your starter, refrigerate it if you don't intend to feed it immediately (at any rate, starter should be fed as soon as possible after you receive it). To feed it for the first time, snip off a corner of the plastic bag and squeeze the starter into a glass or ceramic bowl (not metal). Stir in 3 cups of lukewarm water (what feels comfortable on your wrist) and 3 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour. Mix until it's well blended and the consistency of pancake batter. Let the replenished starter sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to give the yeast a chance to multiply and become active before you put it in the refrigerator. Ordinarily you would feed your starter when you remove some to bake with it. A good rule of thumb is to replenish it every two weeks or so, preferably because you made a wonderful loaf of sourdough bread, a stack of pancakes or a delicious sourdough cake." (This previous paragraph is for those people who have ordered King Arthur's Sourdough Starter from their catalog.)

"During the time the starter is stored in the refrigerator, it becomes relatively dormant which is why it can survive so long with so little attention.
You'll find that a clear, amber colored liquid will accumulate on the surface of the starter. This liquid contains 12% to 14% alcohol."
 "When yeast is in contact with air, it produces carbon dioxide; when it's not, it produces alcohol. When you blend the alcohol back into the starter, it helps produce the unique flavor you find in good sourdough breads. For milder flavor, you can pour off some of the alcohol if you wish although this will thicken the starter requiring a bit more liquid to return it to its "pancake batter" consistency. (To "sweeten" a starter in another way, see Troubleshooting which follows.) The alcohol itself dissipates during the baking process."

     3/4           cup  Candied Fruit and raisins
                        -- (anywhere from 3/4 to 1 1/2 cups) -- 180-375 ml
  1                     beaten egg for glaze

                        -- (see recipe below)
                        -- to decorate the outside

1. Heat the milk to a lukewarm, 100F (40C) degrees, and stir in the yeast.

2. In your bowl pour in the milk mixture, 2 cups (500 ml) flour and 1/4 cup (60 ml) sugar, blend together. This is called a sponge, and let it sit so the yeast activates. (15 min.)

3. While the sponge is working, assemble the other ingredients.

4. Add the eggs, butter, mace, salt, lemon peel, and the fruit and raisins.

5. Add the flour and mix in one cup at a time. Knead until the dough is smooth and shiny. A little bit more flour is necessary if the dough is too sticky, but don't add too much, that will make it heavy!

6. Place in a greased bowl, or right on your cutting board if you like, and let it rise for 2 hours or until doubled.

7. Punch the dough down and divide into 4 or 6 pieces. 8. Now take a piece and
divide it into 3 pieces.Roll each one into a snake about 1+1/2 inch (4 cm) diameter and about 6 to 9 inches (15 to 22 cm) long.

9. Braid the snakes loosely just a few times and tuck in the end pieces.

10. Place on a greased baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pieces.

11. Allow to rise nearly double. Brush with a beaten egg and top with blanched almonds. Our family painstakingly skins and splits the almonds in halves. Bake at 335F to 350F (170C to 180C) for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.

When cooled I double wrap the stollen in plastic wrap, and then foil. I keep them in the freezer and let them cure till the holidays. They are good right out of the oven as well.

Blanching almonds

Put 1 cup (250 ml) of shelled almonds in a pot and bring to a boil. Turn off heat and allow to stand for 5 min. Drain off hot water and cover with cold water and let it stand for a few minutes. Drain and place on a towel. The skins will slip off easily. Split in half starting at the narrow end. The halves stick well to the dough, where the whole almonds are bulky and fall off when you slice the Stollen.

     2/3           cup  milk
  4                     eggs -- lg

Preheat the oven to 375F. Place eight 6-oz custard cups on a large baking sheet. Spoon 1 1/2 tsp of shortening into the bottom of each custard cup and set aside. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, then gradually stir in the milk and water until well blended. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. Fold in the cheddar cheese. Place the baking sheet with the custard cups in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes until the shortening melts and the custard cups are hot. Fill the custard cups 1/2 to 2/3rds full with the batter. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, without opening the oven door until the popovers rise and turn golden brown. If not golden brown after 45 minutes, bake for an additional 5 minutes. Serve piping hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- bleached
     1/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground nutmeg
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar  plus
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  unsulphured molasses
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1                cup  buttermilk  plus
  3        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1 1/2           cups  wheat bran
  1                cup  raisins

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 375°. Mix flour through nutmeg in medium bowl; set aside.

Beat butter in large bowl of electric mixer or with handheld mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add brown sugar, increase speed to medium high, and beat until combined and fluffy, about 1 minute longer. Add eggs one at a time, beating thoroughly before adding the next. Beat in vanilla, molasses, and sour cream until thoroughly combined and creamy, about 1 minute longer. Reduce speed to low; beat in buttermilk and half the flour mixture until combined, about 1 minute. Beat in the remaining flour mixture until incorporated and slightly curdled looking, about 1 minute longer, scraping sides of bowl as necessary. Stir in bran and raisins.

Spray a twelve mold muffin tin (each mold measuring 1/2 cup) or a six mold muffin tin (each mold measuring 1 cup) with cooking spray or coat lightly with butter; divide batter evenly among molds using spoon or ice cream scoop. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center withdraws cleanly or with a few moist particles adhering to it, about 25 minutes. Set on wire rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove muffins from tin and serve warm.

Note: Wheat bran is available at health food stores or in boxes, labeled Quaker Unprocessed Bran, in supermarkets.

Bran muffins tend to overbake in a flash. A tray of muffins are baked through when they retract ever so slightly from the sides of the cups and the tops spring back very gently. Don't look for an active spring. The muffins will be baked through even though a wooden pick withdraws from the centers with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. These are bakery-style bran muffins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  tomato juice -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried rosemary
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
     1/3           cup  chopped sun-dried tomatoes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rapid-rising or active dry yeast

Makes 2 baguettes.

If you bake this bread on the French Bread cycle in your bread machine, you won't have baguettes, but you will have lots of crunchy crust. Loaves baked on a baking sheet instead of on tiles will not have a classic crunchy crust, but they'll still be delicious.

To mix the dough in the bread machine: Pour the tomato juice into the pan. In the order listed, add the salt, olive oil, dried rosemary, garlic, tomatoes, whole wheat and bread flours. Make an indentation in the dry ingredients and add the yeast.

If ONLY mixing the dough: Select the Dough setting on bread machine, and press Start. (Then read on to "For either method.")

If mixing AND baking dough in bread machine: Select the Basic or French Bread cycle, set the crust on Medium or Dark, and press Start.

For either method: If the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not soft to the touch but is very firm, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. The machine will stop when the dough is ready to shape and bake.

To shape for oven baking: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board; punch it down. Divide the dough into 2 parts, and shape each into a long baguette.

To bake on baking tiles: Leave the loaves, with the smooth side up, on the floured board, and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, 45 minutes. Place baking tiles or a pizza tile on the top rack in the oven, and place a heavy, shallow pan on the bottom rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Using a sharp knife or a razor, slash the loaves; place the loaves onto the preheated tiles. Immediately pour 1 cup water into the pan on the bottom rack. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until the loaf is golden. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

To bake in a pan: Lightly grease a baking pan. Place the loaves, with the smooth side up, into the pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Using a sharp knife or a razor, slash the top of the loaves, and brush them with water. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until the loaves are golden. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

              Too Much Leavening Can Make Baked Goods A Flop

                 *****

Have you ever had a cake that rose beautifully, but five minutes before it was to come out of the oven, it fell in the center? You might think that when cakes or muffins fall or are heavy, they need more baking powder, but often the opposite is true: the problem may be too much leavener.

I get phone calls about overleavening problems every week, and a colleague with a call-in cooking show says this is one of the problems she hears about most frequently. Someday I'll go through a stack of cookbooks to see just how many recipes are overleavened.

Baking powder and soda must be in balance.

By leavening, of course, I mean baking soda and baking powder, not yeast.

Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, which when heated breaks down to form some carbon dioxide gas and sodium carbonate--a salt with a soapy taste. However, the major gas production occurs when baking soda combines with an acid. In this case, a milder tasting salt is left behind.

Baking powder contains baking soda and the exact amount of acid to balance the soda, along with some cornstarch to keep the two active ingredients separate and dry.

When you have too much of either of these chemical leaveners, the gas bubbles in the batter get big, bump into each other, become huge, float to the top, and then pop--there goes your leavening.

So what is the correct amount of leavener? In most recipes, 1 to 1-1/4 teaspoons baking powder per cup of flour provides ideal leavening (see the chart below). Some baked goods with a lot of heavy ingredients, like a carrot cake, may need a little more leavening, but not much.

Chemical leavener needed per cup of flour These ratios are good to remember so you can evaluate recipes before you try them and so you can successfully tinker with or create your own recipes.
For nonacidic recipes:

     1 cup flour
     1 to 1-1/4 tsp. baking
     powder
                       For very acidic recipes:

                           1 cup flour
                           1/2 tsp. baking powder
                           and
                           1/8 tsp. baking soda
(Note: Baked goods with a lot of heavy ingredients, like carrot cake, may need a tiny bit more leavening.)

In most recipes, baking powder is preferred because of its reliability (it contains exactly the right amount of acids to completely neutralize all the soda, leaving no aftertaste) and because of its double action (one acid dissolves when water is added, producing bubbles, and another acid does not dissolve and produce leavening until a higher temperature is reached in the oven). Sometimes you'll see a double-acting baking powder with only one acid in the list of ingredients. This product may use encapsulation, like time-release cold pills, to produce leavening at different times.

Baking soda is normally used in recipes that contain acidic ingredients such as sour cream, buttermilk, brown sugar, or chocolate. You need to remember, though, that the soda isn't just neutralizing acids: it's also making bubbles, and it can easily overleaven.

Muscle-man soda is often the culprit. Frequently, overleavening is caused by an excessive amount of soda. Many cooks and recipe writers don't realize the strength of baking soda. A whole teaspoon of baking powder contains only 1/4 teaspoon baking soda as its major active ingredient.

Solving the mystery of the concave cake

A test kitchen asked me about a cake recipe that called for adding boiling water to the soda, letting it stand, and then combining it with other ingredients. Sometimes the cake worked, and sometimes it fell. What we figured out was that the recipe had too much soda, but if the cook allowed the soda to stand long enough with the boiling water, enough of the gases came off to prevent the cake from falling. If it didn't stand long enough, the cake was badly overleavened and fell. Recipes like this are tricky, to say the least.

  1                tsp  salt
  1 1/3           cups  water

Mix with enough water to form soft dough. Gently knead until smooth. Divide into 4 pieces. Roll or stretch each piece until 10-12" round. Riddle with fork tines. Heat black cast iron pan hot enough so that flour will darken, but not burn. Place disk in pan and let heat one one side - then turn it over. Dough is ready when little charred bubbles form on surface.

Can serve this way or with filler i.e., salami, sauteed greens.

  1                cup  hot water -- (120-130F)
     1/4           cup  molasses
  1         tablespoon  salt
  4               cups  bread flour -- (4 to 4 1/2)

SPROUT THE RYE GRAINS
To grow sprouts, measure the rye berries into a medium bowl and cover with water. Put aside to soak for 8 - 12 hours. Drain. Cover the bowl with tight-fitting plastic wrap and leave to sprout for 24 hours. The sprouts will be small, just peeking out.

MAKE THE SOUR
To make the sour, pour the rye flour and rye flakes into a medium bowl. Add yeast and hot water, mix well and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside to ferment overnight.

MAKE THE DOUGH
To make the dough, pour all of the sour into a large mixing bowl and stir in the hot water and molasses. Add the sprouts, salt and bread flour. Beat to combine thoroughly. Add the white flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a shaggy mass that can be lifted to the work surface. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.

FERMENT THE DOUGH
Place dough in a bowl and allow to rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk (or longer if you really want a sour flavor).

SHAPE THE DOUGH
Divide the dough into boules and let rise until double in bulk, about 40 minutes.

BAKE THE DOUGH
Preheat the oven to 500F while the dough is rising. Just before putting the bread in the oven, turn the temperature down to 400F. Spritz the oven heavily with water three times during the first ten minutes of baking. Bake a total of 35-40 or until done.

NOTES : Rye developed as a "weed" in the wheat fields and would grow under the cold, damp conditions of Northern Europe where wheat would not always do well. As a result, eastern and northeastern countries have developed a fine repertoire of rye loaves. This recipe is adapted from Bernard Clayton's Triple Rye Bread recipe.

  2                     frozen pastry-style pie shells
                        -- (or your favorite recipe)
  2                Tbs  butter or margarine -- (30 ml)
     1/2           cup  chopped onions -- (125 ml)
     1/2           cup  chopped celery -- (125 ml)
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans -- (125 ml)
  3               cups  cooked turkey -- (750 ml) coarsely
                        chopped
                        or chicken meat
  1 1/2            tsp  caraway seeds -- (7 ml)
                        Salt and freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

Roll the pastry dough out and cut into 8 squares, each about 4 x 4 inches (10 x 10 cm) and transfer to a greased baking sheet. Melt the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat and saute the onion, celery, and pecans, until the onions are lightly browned. Add the remaining ingredients, stir to combine, and remove from heat. Divide the filling between the 8 pastry squares, and fold each square in half over the filling, forming triangles. Seal the edges with the tines of a fork. Bake in a preheated 400F (200C) oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until browned.

Makes 8.

                Vegetable & Herb Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  instant potato flakes
  1                cup  water
  6        tablespoons  skim milk
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1            package  dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  skim milk -- (105 to 115F)
  5               cups  bread flour -- divided
     1/4           cup  stick margarine -- softened
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cider vinegar
  1              large  egg
                        Cooking spray

1.  Combine first 5 ingredients; set aside.

2. Dissolve yeast and sugar in 3/4 cup warm milk in a large bowl, and let sugar mixture stand 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, potato mixture, margarine, salt, vinegar, and egg, and beat mixture at medium speed of a mixer until smooth. Stir in 1 cup flour to form a sticky dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes), and add enough of the remaining flour to prevent dough from sticking to hands.

3. Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover dough, and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

4. Punch dough down, and divide in half. Working with one portion at a time (cover remaining dough to keep from drying), roll dough into a 10 x 7-inch rectangle. Cut dough crosswise into 20 (7-inch-long) 1/2-inch-wide strips. Gently twist strips of dough. Repeat with remaining dough. Place dough twists 1 inch apart on two baking sheets coated with cooking spray. Cover dough twists, and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

5. Preheat oven to 350F.

6. Uncover breadsticks. Bake breadsticks at 350F for 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from pan, and let cool on wire racks. Yield: 40 breadsticks (serving size: I breadstick).

Note: To make 2 loaves instead of breadsticks, roll each portion into a 10 x 7-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Roll up rectangle tightly, starting with a long edge and pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seam and ends to seal. Place roll, seam side down, in a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake 30 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pans; let cool on wire racks.

                 *****

In the "Jesuit Bread Book" I discovered that adding a pan of water to the oven to affect the crust on bread doesn't work. What the author has done for years, and now so have I, is to spray well the pre-baked bread with vinegar (and sprinkle on the sesame seeds or poppy seeds or coarse salt etcetera) and bake it for five minutes, spray well again, bake for five minutes, spray a final time and bake for the remainder of the time suggested. The vinegar is supposed to evaporate and leave no taste but I find this isn't so. A taste remains which I feel, and lots of people who have tasted my bread also feel, adds beautifully to the flavour of the French or Italian or herb or rosemary-buttermilk or bread sticks; any kind of plain or savory bread seems to be enhanced by this. I wouldn't try it with a sweet bread. And it makes the sesame seeds stick, too! [dr.baker1@pei.sympatico.ca]
---

I use a simple method of beating one egg in a cup with a fork, then brushing it on the loaf just before I put it in the oven. I preheat a stone at 500 degrees for about 20 minutes, then lower the temp to 400 when I put the loaf in. I find about 45-50 minutes is good to get a nice brown loaf without burning the seeds, but your oven temp may vary from mine. I use this method for Italian bread. You could also just use the egg white. The egg that's left over I nuke on high for one minute in a microwave and with a little salt and pepper it's a little snack for the baker. [Frank Cavalier <fcaval@idt.net>]

---
You can use egg without it burning. I would use one egg white mixed with 1 T. of water (beat it a little), after your bread is formed and just before you place it in the oven, gently apply the wash and the seeds. It will be shiny and very pretty to look at! ["Jo in Minnesota" <josiem@tekstar.com>]

---
In response to the question of how to get sesame seeds to stick to your bread, here's what I do. (I make sourdough bread (in the machine), take it out to let it rise, then bake in the oven.) I have a little spray bottle which I fill with water, and "spritz" the bread (after shaping and scoring the top) with water, shake on my sesame seeds, then let it rise as usual and bake. The extra water on the loaves never seems to make a difference, and the seeds stay stuck! I also sometimes spritz the bread just before putting it in the oven for a nice crust. Good luck.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  fresh Boletus edulis -- (mushrooms)
  16             small  pitted black olives
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  dry milk powder -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  gluten -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  yeast
  1                cup  water

Original recipe calls for 3-4 oz. mushrooms and 12-16 olives

Chop the mushrooms and briefly sear in a frying pan on medium heat, to kill any critters and partially cook. Knead all of the ingredients together, rise for 1 hour, form into a loaf, then rise again for 1 hour or more. Bake in a preheated oven at 350F for 1 hour. If you are using a bread machine, use the dough cycle and wait to put the mushrooms and olives in until after removing the kneaded dough (otherwise the machine will crush them too finely.) Fold the mushrooms and olives into the dough by hand, then form a loaf and let rise for an hour before cooking, as before. Feel free to substitute any mushroom you prefer. Agaricus work very well, among others. For a stronger olive flavor, use green olives instead of black.

Note: This bread recipe uses fresh Boletus edulis because their soft texture blends better with the texture of the bread. Dried porcini become a little bit chewy upon reconstitution, so if you wish to substitute them, be sure to chop them up very small. Substitute about 1/4 cup dry porcini, reconstituted for an hour in 1 cup of water. Drain the water into another measuring cup, and top off to return to 1 cup, which you will then use for the bread.

Yeast: profiles in leavening

This article was found in:http://www.betterbaking.com/baker2/yeast.html

Ah yeast. The baker's soul mate. Show me a baker or pastry chef worth his or her whites who does not love this ingredient. Every cell of yeast is filled with potential. In bread, yeast is everything. How it develops affects just about every facet of the final result. In pastry, it takes on another face entirely. Yeast-based coffeecakes, babas au rum, brioches, croissants depend on yeast for their unique dough and crumb structures.


Know your yeast:
The more you know about yeast, the more you can appreciate the joys of working with it. Many bakers are unconditionally loyal to a particular format or brand. In professional circles, consistency is very important so yeast is chosen carefully. At home, we need a yeast which suits most of our baking needs. But where to start? Fresh, active dry, instant, quick, rapid, 'bread machine' yeast. Sheesh. Read on.

Fresh (compressed) yeast:
Your grandmother probably used fresh yeast. Purists adore it. Doughs made with it are supple and bouncy and the yeast fragrance is subtle. Fresh yeast, usually the choice of professional bakeries, is best for doughs which are not going through exhaustive handling. The strains used to make fresh yeast are different from those used to make dry yeast. Dry strains are selected for their stability under stress (drying, rehydration, poor handling). Dry yeast contains 5% to 8% moisture compared to 70% to 72% in fresh. After rehydration (adding water to proof) or mixing with other ingredients, there is a "lag phase" which the dry yeast requires in order to become active again. Fresh yeast, of course, does not impose this lag.

Fresh yeast does have its drawbacks. It is far less stable a product than dry. Fresh yeast in compressed form or in 'cream' form is delivered every other day to the commercial baker - sometimes by the tanker truck load. Home bakers must rely on a benevolent professional to obtain fresh yeast or purchase compressed yeast in the dairy case (when ever it's available). Since fresh is not proofed like dry, it's more difficult to tell if it's viable. Fresh yeast keeps for 10 to 20 days. If you buy a one pound block (which is what I do, although some bakeries will sell you half a pound) you may wish to freeze it. To do this, wrap it well in waxed paper then in plastic wrap and seal. It is important to keep the yeast from drying. Allow the yeast to defrost gradually in the refrigerator the night before you are planning to do use it. The longer the yeast is frozen, the more it will lose potency. When in doubt, discard.


Active dry yeast:
Most cookbooks still call for 'active dry yeast'. Bakers who honed their skills with this yeast, know what to expect from it. It will eventually be replaced by 'instant yeast'. When 'active dry' is called for, you may confidently substitute 'instant' if you like (see the substitution guide). As with fresh yeast, active dry is a live culture - with one notable exception. It must be proofed or reconstituted with water and a bit of sugar before use (it cannot be added to dry ingredients). Active dry yeast usually comes in a vacuum brick or can. Once exposed to air and moisture, it starts to lose its potency. A container of active dry yeast should be well sealed and refrigerated or frozen. Always take note of the expiration date.

Instant yeast - a.k.a. 'Fast Rising' or 'Bread Machine Yeast': Probably the most confusing thing the yeast companies could have done for was to introduce a new product and call it "Instant" yeast. True, it was developed to shorten fermentation time (a nod to commercial baking), but they should have chosen a more distinctive approach. These so-called "instant" yeasts were invented in Holland and were later replicated by others. Instant yeast is very active and very tolerant. It offers the baker a wide margin for error or experimentation. It activates rapidly in warm water and can be added to other ingredients in its dry state. It's a good keeper - 3 to 4 months in the freezer. Instant yeast is a good choice for rich coffee cakes and sweet breads which you may wish to freeze and for doughs which will see a slow rise in the refrigerator.

Instant yeast's qualities become a detriment - when you use too much of it. How do you know if this is the case? A premature rise and an overt yeasty, 'beery' odor. Problems also 'arise' when you allow a dough to proof too long. Make sure you do not allow doughs to rise beyond double their original size (I go for 1 1/2). You can always opt for more fermentation in the final rise. Over-fermented doughs reduce the shelf life of the final product. The solution is very simple: less is more. Decrease by 15% to 25% increments. You can use too little yeast, but you won't compromise taste and structure if you let it rise (albeit) slowly. This may not work, however, with rich or heavy breads (i.e. rye) which need good fermentation power and mixtures which contain perishables.

A yeast recipe collection:
All recipes call for "dry yeast". This can be either active dry or instant. Both will work. Note that recipes made with active dry will require a slightly longer fermentation time because the yeast is less potent (gram for gram).

Using yeast in scones or kamishbrot, lends a novel texture and crumb. In the pizza dough, you can see how a combination of baking powder and yeast makes for a tender, chewy crust.

Substitution guide:
1 tablespoon active dry = 2 1/2 teaspoons instant = 3/4 ounce fresh yeast

  2               tbsp  ground thyme
  2                tsp  whole dried oregano
  2                tsp  ground savory
  2                tsp  ground marjoram
     1/2           tsp  whole leaf dried marjoram
  1               tbsp  sumac, (optional)
  1                cup  sesame seeds
     1/2           tsp  kosher salt
                        zest 2 lemons, finely minced

For topping: Stir zaatar spices, salt lemon juice and olive oil in small bowl and set aside.

For bread: whisk together yeast, water and sugar. Stir in oil, salt, all purpose flour and most of bread flour - reserve 1 cup. Mix to form a soft dough. Knead 8 - 10 minutes add reserve flour as necessary. Place dough in well greased bowl, cover with plastic and tea towel and let rise till doubled. OR a long cool rise in refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Dough keeps for 3 days.

If refrigerated, let assume room temperature. Break off sections of dough about size of grapefruit. Stretch or roll into irregular slabs. Let rest 15 minutes, cover with damp tea towel. Smear, spoon or brush each with some of olive oil zaatar mixture.

Preheat grill to hottest temperature. Lay slabs gently on grill. Cover for 1-2 minutes, then check to gauge doneness. Allow to bake until tops begin to brown. Brush with additional topping if desired.

To cook over charcoal grill, watch out for hot spots. Start checking slabs of dough after just 1 minute to ensure that they are not burning.
Zaatar Spice:

Blend together both oreganos, both thymes, savory, marjoram, sumac,
sesame seeds, salt and lemon zest.  Use for zaatar flatbread.
