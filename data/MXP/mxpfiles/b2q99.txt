Spring wheat and winter wheat make different types of flours.

Spring wheat is sowed in the Northern United States and Canada in spring and harvested in late summer, said Joe Caron, a spokesman for King Arthur Flour. It is generally the faster-growing ``hard'' variety.

When ground, hard spring wheat yields a high-protein, high-gluten flour well suited for baking bread, bagels and some pastas.

Winter wheat is a slow-growing type that is sowed in the fall, goes dormant over the winter and is harvested in mid- to late spring.

In the United States, winter wheat is grown from Texas to Kansas and may be either ``hard'' or ``soft.''

In general, winter wheat flour has less protein than spring wheat flour. It is best for pastries, cakes and cookies. Many bakers say that it is more flavorful than spring wheat because of its longer growing season.

Although most brands of flour do not indicate the type of wheat, bread flours are almost always made from hard spring wheat and pastry flours from soft winter wheat.

All-purpose flour is usually a mix of several types.

                        Starter:
  1                Cup  Milk -- (room temperature)
  1                Cup  Sugar
  1                Cup  REGULAR Flour -- (room temperature)

  1                cup  sugar
  1 1/2           tsp.  baking powder
  1               tsp.  cinnamon -- (1 to 2)
     1/2          tsp.  baking soda
  1                box  instant vanilla pudding -- (5.1 oz)
     1/2          tsp.  salt
  1                cup  nuts


Starter:
1 Cup Milk, (room temperature)
1 Cup Sugar
1 Cup REGULAR Flour, (room temperature)

Note: do not use Self-Rising flour.

Mix in a non-metallic bowl - glass or plastic is fine

Note: The metal interferes with the chemical reaction that needs to take place. Use a plastic or wooden stirrer. Don't be concerned if you can't get ALL the lumps out. Try to mix until lumps are pea sized, but with none larger than a grape. Pour into a 1 gallon freezer ziplock bag.

NEVER REFRIGERATE OR LET METAL
TOUCH THE HERMAN BABY!

The cold retards the action and the flavor is not as "full".

Note: The finished Sponge will expand to over 2 to 3 times its original volume. Let starter sit in a quiet place, away from drafts or hot breezes.

Attach the following Instructions to the starter that you share:

Day 1: Congratulations on receiving your own Herman baby!

NEVER REFRIGERATE OR LET METAL TOUCH THE HERMAN BABY!

The cold retards the action and the flavor is not as "full".

Day 2: Squeeze Herman

Day 3: Squeeze Herman

Day 4: Squeeze Herman

Day 5 : Squeeze Herman

Day 6 Add 1 Cup Flour, 1 Cup Sugar, 1 Cup Milk, Squeeze

Day 7: Squeeze Herman

Day 8 Squeeze Herman

Day 9: Squeeze Herman

Day 10:  Put Herman in a large glass bowl. Add 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar and        1 cup milk. Stir with a wooden spoon. Take out 3 cups and place 1 cup each into three separate plastic freezer bags.  Give one bag and a copy of Herman's care and feeding instructions to three friends.

To the remaining Herman  (a little over one cup) , add the following ingredients and mix well.
1 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
3 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla

In a separate bowl combine the following dry ingredients and mix well:

2 cups flour
1 cup sugar
1-1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 or 2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1  box instant vanilla pudding, (5.1 oz)
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup nuts

Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients. Mix and pour into two well greased and sugared bread pans. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour.

NOTES : Got this from another list and thought it was cute. I've seen another, but it has baking powder and baking soda in it. The real Friendship bread is made with a sponge, and no yeast. The point is to share the sponge amongst one's friends - ergo Friendship bread. There are several versions circulating, but I thought this one was kind of cute. It's the only one I've seen that has included the instructions for "Herman."

* Use 2 tsp. Red Star Dry or 1-1/4 tsp. Red Star Quick Rise Yeast
** Use one of the flour combinations (A-D)in the basic recipe.

In a bowl, soak the gelatin in water for two minutes. Set aside. Add the yeast to the machine. Add the flours, dry milk, gum, Sure-Jell, and salt to the machine. Sugar is the last dry ingredient added. Warm the water-gelatin mixture to 85 degrees in a microwave or on the stove top. Add to the machine with the remaining wet ingredients. The amount of water is based upon the degree of moisture desired in the finished loaf and type of flour used. There is no problem with overflowing of the loaf with 1 3/4 cups of water. Press start. Multi- logic settings: Kneading - 0, Rising - 20, Baking - 50. The bread can be made in the Model 100's four hour cycle. Allow to cool before slicing.

NOTES : These bread machine recipes were collected and tested by Mike Jones  (mjones@digital.net) and demonstrate the quality of GF breads that are  available with a minimum amount of work.

These recipes were tested in a Welbilt model 150 and will work without modification in the Welbilt model 100, DAK, and Zojirushi BBCC-S15. Recipes for other machines are noted.

This is a wonderful, moist sandwich bread or foundation for other breads. It comes in four variations to accommodate different tastes. It can be made lactose free by using dry milk substitute instead of non-fat dry milk. This bread does not require premixing of ingredients. Sure-Jell from Kraft Foods, is pectin. It is normally used in making home jellies. The dough can be remove from the machine and used to make hamburger buns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 lb loaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Active dry yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Gluten
  3               cups  Whole wheat flour
  2          teaspoons  Salt
  3        tablespoons  Honey
  1               cups  warm water

If you don't like making bagels but want the texture of bagels with the
low-fat nutritional benefits; try this bread. It tastes like a bagel and is
especially good sliced and toasted.

There is one note for the Panasonic/National machines and that is to use 3
tsp yeast for 1 1/2 lb loaf. I believe that this is for the older Panasonics as I do remember Linda Rehberg saying that the newer models came
out after their book was published and that the yeast amounts in her book
were not for the newer Panasonics. Upon re-reading I found I missed one
thing. I did add a few more tsps of water as the dough ball was not forming
to my liking. Let me know if you make this and how you like it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
     1/2          cups  Warm Water
  1               cups  Bananas -- Mashed
     1/4          cups  Sugar

Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1-1/2 hours.

Grease well 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan. Punch down dough. Roll into rectangle, 16 x 8 inch. Mix 1/4 cup sugar with the cinnamon and sprinkle over the rectangle of dough. Roll dough up tightly, beginning at narrow side. Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal well. Place seam side down in pan. Cover; let rise until double(about 1 hour).

Heat oven to 375F. Bake until golden, about 35 minutes. Remove from pan, and brush top with butter. If desired, can be frosted with a confectioners' sugar glaze.

Recipe By     :Kurtis Baguley
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Daily Bread Mailing List
                Starter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------


Day 1:

1     C     whole wheat flour, organic if possible
1     Tbsp  diastatic malt
1     tsp   honey
1     C     raisin water

(To make raisin water, soak raisins 15 to 20 minutes in 1 1/2 C water,
then discard raisins.)

Mix all ingredients until they form a smooth sponge.  Cover loosely and  allow to ferment at room temperature (65 to 75 F) for 24 hours.  Do not  cover too tightly as it will form lactic acid.  Also do not cover too  loosely.

Day 2:

1     C     unbleached bread flour, organic if possible
1/2   tsp   diastatic malt
1     tsp   honey
3/4   C     water

Add day 2 ingredients and mix well, making certain that all the flour is
wet.  Cover again and allow to ferment at room temperature for another 24
hours.

Day 3:

2     C     unbleached bread flour, organic if possible
1     tsp   diastatic malt
1 1/2 C     water

You should be seeing some signs of activity by the third day. Add the day 3 ingredients and mix well. Don't worry if the previous day's sponge has separated. Cover again and allow to ferment at room temperature for another 24 hours.

Day 4:

2     C     unbleached bread flour, organic if possible
1 1/2 C     water

There should be definite signs of fermentation in the form of bubbling and a faint smell of vinegar. Discard half the starter. Refresh with the day 4 ingredients as on the previous days. Cover again and allow to ferment at room temperature for another 24 hours.
Day 5:

2     C     unbleached bread flour, organic if possible
1 1/2 C     water

Discard half the barm. Repeat the day 4 refreshment instructions. You may begin building a sourdough loaf on day 6.

The next day (of the rest of your life):

Follow the basic refreshment pattern of one cup flour to 3/4 cups water for every two cups of barm. You always want to approximately double the barm to ensure that the yeast has plenty on which to feed. After a refreshment, allow the barm to remain at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours, and then refrigerate until the next refreshment.

Refresh the barm every day or every other day, whichever pattern you find works best. Some claim that better, more complex flavors come from a two day refreshment cycle. You will have to refresh the barm on any day that you make bread in order to rebuild your maintenance volume.

You should keep enough barm to be able to make bread and have two cups left over.

When building a dough, it is recommended to remove the barm from the refrigerator one to two hours before you begin to allow the yeast to reawaken. Catch the barm before it falls to make tomorrow's starter.

Never try building a dough from a barm that has just been refreshed. Always allow the barm to ferment four to six hours (and preferably refrigerate it overnight) before beginning.

On a day when you are not building a dough, but need to refresh the barm, discard to about half of your maintenance level and refresh as usual. On a day when you begin to build a loaf, the discard goes toward the build (firm starter).

If you neglect the barm for four or five days to a week, discard all but a cup of barm and rebuild over two to three days of refreshment. The barm may be considered neglected if there is a greyish liquor (known as "hooch") floating on top. A healthy barm will have a definite feeling of life when you put your hand in it; a neglected barm will not. It will feel like a flat pancake batter.

You may freeze barm for up to six months and refresh it (at least) three feedings to bring it back up to strength.

If you want to leave the barm unattended for a period of time, feed it and leave it for three hours at room temperature, then refrigerate it.

NOTES : Recently we attended a class "San Francisco Sourdough vs. the French Levain", given by Chef Kurtis Baguley. It was an incredible class!! He has graciously given permission for us to post the recipes from the class. If you ever have the opportunity to take a class from Kurtis, don't pass up the chance.

Here are the recipes for the San Francisco sourdough and the barm and firm starter. The recipe for the French levain will follow next week. Since the barm will take you a week to make, you don't really need either of the bread recipes until then, but here is one anyway.

     1/2          cups  warm water -- (100-115 degrees F)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  evaporated milk
  7               cups  flour
     1/4           cup  vegetable shortening
                        oil for deep frying
                        confectioner's sugar for dusting
                        -- (or burying depending on taste)

Put the warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle in the yeast and a couple teaspoons of the sugar and stir until thoroughly dissolved. Let proof for 10
minutes. Add the rest of the sugar, salt, eggs, and evaporated milk. Gradually
stir in 4 cups of the flour and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth and thoroughly blended. Beat in the shortening, then add the remaining flour, about 1/3 cup at a time, beating it in with a spoon until it becomes too stiff to stir, then working in the rest with your hands. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight in a greased bowl.

Roll the dough out onto a floured board or marble pastry surface to a thickness
of 1/8 inch, then cut it into rectangles 2-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches with a sharp knife. Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 360 degrees F. Fry the beignets about 3 or 4 at a time until they are puffed out and golden brown on both sides,
about 2-3 minutes per batch. Turn them over in the oil with tongs once or twice
to get them evenly brown, since they rise to the surface of the oil as soon as
they begin to puff out. Drain each batch, place on a platter lined with several
layers of paper towels, and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven until they're all
done. Sprinkle with sugar. Serve immediately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  Spelt Flour
  1               Tbsp  Baking Powder
  1              Pinch  Salt
     1/4          cups  Margarine -- chilled
     1/2          cups  Soy Milk -- lite
     1/2           Tsp  Margarine -- melted

A melt-in-your mouth texture will make these a favorite breakfast treat. Experiment with adding basil, dried onion, and oregano for herbed biscuits, or raisins, finely chopped nuts, and orange juice (instead of soy milk) for a sweet version.

Heat oven to 450F. Grease a lg baking sheet. In lg bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. With pastry cutter or two knives, cut in margarine until mixture resembles fine crumbs.

Stir in soy milk until a soft dough forms and mixture pulls away from sides of bowl; do not overmix.

Turn dough out onto generously floured board. Knead gently (about 10 times). Pat dough out to between 1/4 - 1/2" thick. Cut with 2-1/2" biscuit cutter. Re-roll and cut scraps until remaining dough is used. Place on baking sheet and brush with melted margarine.

Bake biscuits about 10 min or until very lightly browned. Serve warm or at room temp.

In a bowl, soak the gelatin in water for two minutes. Set aside. Add the yeast to the machine. Add the flours, dry milk, gum, Sure-Jell, and salt to the machine. Sugar is the last dry ingredient added. Warm the water-gelatin mixture to 85 degrees in a microwave or on the stove top. Add to the machine with the remaining wet ingredients. The amount of water is based upon the degree of moisture desired in the finished loaf and type of flour used. There is no problem with overflowing of the loaf with 1 3/4 cups of water. Press start. Multi- logic settings: Kneading - 0, Rising - 20, Baking - 50. The bread can be made in the Model 100's four hour cycle. Allow to cool before slicing.

This is a wonderful, moist sandwich bread or foundation for other breads. It comes in four variations to accommodate different tastes. It can be made lactose free by using dry milk substitute instead of non-fat dry milk. This bread does not require premixing of ingredients. Sure-Jell from Kraft Foods, is pectin. It is normally used in making home jellies. The dough can be remove from the machine and used to make hamburger buns.

                       Breads On The Grill, How To

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

1. I cook my pizzas directly on the grill, with no pan with great success. Simply get the barby very hot, then turn one side to very low, leaving the other side on full. Place the dough directly on the grill on the low side for about 2 minutes. Remove from the barby, flip dough over, add the toppings of your choice, and put back on the grill for about 5 - 8 minutes. The first step of the two minute cook on the one side can be done a couple of hours ahead so that if you are doing these for a group, you don't have too long to wait.

2. When I make focaccia bread, I shape them in foil pie plates. After they have risen the requisite amount of time, they can be cooked on the barby the same as in an oven, assuming that your barby has reasonable temperature control. I usually place the foil pan on what is usually used as the bun warming rack, or as with the pizza trick, turn one side low and leave the other sufficiently high to give a temp of around 375 - 400. The focaccia's in the foil pans also freeze very well. Simply shape the dough and put into the oiled pan, then place it in a well oiled zip lock bag and freeze. When you are ready to use, remove from the freezer and bag, cover and let it thaw out - takes several hours, dimple it, sprinkle with salt, olives or whatever you use, and bake it when it has risen enough. There are no specific instructions for this as regards time, etc - after all, it is bread, not a life choice!

                        sliced almonds or shredded coconut to
                        sprinkle on top of the loaves

Grease six mini-loaf pans and dust with granulated sugar with a wire whisk, blend the eggs, oil, and applesauce in a small bowl. In a separate, larger bowl, use a wire whisk to mix flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Remove the wire whisks from the preparation area, because you'll be using only a wooden spoon from here on in. Add the wet ingredients, stirring to mix well. Add the starter and vanilla and mix until well blended, then stir in the chocolate chips. Divide the batter
equally between the mini-loaf pans. they'll be a little over halfway full. Sprinkle the almonds or coconut atop each loaf. Place the pans on a cookie sheet, which acts as a tray, and place it on the middle rack of a preheated 350F oven.
Bake for 30 minutes. Feel the top of each loaf; if they are still soft bake additional 5 minutes, or until the tops of the loaves spring back when gently pressed. Remove the cookie sheet with the pans on it from the oven, and place on a wire rack to cool. Cool the loaves completely in the pans.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge:
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1                cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  instant yeast
                        Dough:
                        sponge -- (from above)
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast
  1 1/2           cups  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  nonfat dry milk
     1/4           cup  water -- (1/4 to 1/2)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

This bread begins with an overnight sponge, which means the finished loaf has just the barest of sour tangs. As the sponge ferments, it creates certain acids that not only give the bread flavor, but affect the gluten, making the bread chewier. The use of a sponge will also increase the loaf's shelf life.

Carol Field, in her wonderful book The Italian Baker, claims that this dough is one that simply can't be kneaded by hand; it's just too sticky. Keep this in mind when you're preparing the dough. During the winter you'll need to use the greater amount of water in the range indicated below. In the dog days of August, when your flour's been in a humid kitchen all summer, you'll use the lesser amount. Your goal is a dough that is very sticky, but holds its shape; when you scoop it out onto your work surface, it will settle into a flattened mound that is best approached with oiled hands and a bench knife or bowl scraper.

Mix the sponge ingredients, in a small bowl or in the pan of your bread machine, until well combined (program the machine for Dough, then cancel it once the ingredients are mixed, after a couple of minutes). Let the sponge rest overnight, covered, or for up to 15 hours. Mixer Method: Place all of the dough ingredients into the bowl of your mixer, and beat it at medium speed, using the flat beater, for 5 to 8 minutes. The dough will never completely clear the sides of the bowl, though it'll begin to acquire some shape. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours; it will get very puffy.

Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. Examine the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle; it should be very tacky, but should be holding its shape somewhat. Adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water, as necessary. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Transfer the dough to a well-oiled work surface. Lightly grease a large cookie sheet, and your hands. Using a bench knife or your fingers, divide the dough in half. Handling the dough gently, stretch it into a log about 10-inches long, and place it on the baking sheet. Flatten the log with your fingers till it's about 10-inches long and 4 to 5-inches wide. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough. Lightly cover the dough with heavily oiled plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy. Oil your fingers, and gently poke deep holes all over the dough. Re-oil the plastic wrap, re-cover the dough, and allow it to rise for an additional hour.

Dust the dough very lightly with flour. Bake it in a preheated 425F oven, throwing four or five ice cubes on the floor of the oven as you put the bread in. Allow the ciabatta to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it's golden brown. Turn off the oven, remove the ciabatta from the baking sheet, and return the loaf to the oven, propping the oven door open a couple of inches with a folded-over potholder. Allow the ciabatta to cool completely in the oven; this will give it a very crisp crust.

NOTES : We love this recipe. It yields an extremely light, air pocket-riddled loaf, wonderful for dunking in soup or splitting lengthwise, to make a sandwich. Ciabatta literally means "slipper" in Italian, and the name refers to the shape of the bread -- a flattened oval, kind of like a comfortable old bedroom slipper you just can't bear to throw out. However, Ciabatta has come to mean, at least in this country, any airy, dimpled loaf dusted with flour, of just about any shape. We like to remain true to the original spirit of the loaf, and shape it into a rough oval.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Make A Stiff Starter:
     1/4           Tsp  Yeast -- Dissolved In
     1/4          cups  Lukewarm Water
     2/3          cups  Flour
                        Mix Starter With:
  1                Tsp  Yeast -- Dissolved In
     1/4          cups  Lukewarm Water
                        Add:
     3/4          cups  Cool Water
  2 3/4           cups  Flour
  1 1/2            Tsp  Salt

Cover starter mixture tightly and let rise 3 - 5 hrs.

After the addition of the salt beat the *ell out of this until very, very elastic. (15 minutes in a heavy duty mixer with dough hook) Knead in enough more flour to make a still soft dough. Let rise about 3 hours Place in a lightly oiled zip lock bag and chill 2 - 8 hours.

Scrape dough out onto well floured board Handle it with floured hands while shaping into a long log. You can brush off the flour after the bread is baked. Cover and let rise until puffy. While dough is rising, preheat oven, with tiles on rack, to 425 degrees. Handle dough gently but just use your hands under it to carry it to the hot oven and place on tiles. Stretch the dough slightly as you do this. Bake about 30 - 40 minutes until done. The crust should be thin and crisp. If you want a thicker crust, steam the oven during the first ten minutes.

It works best with unbleached white flour but whole wheat is OK (takes more kneading, has less crisp crust and may become a little sour)

  5               cups  all-purpose flour -- (5 to 6)
  2                pkg  active dry yeast
  1               tbsp  sugar
  2                tsp  salt
     1/4           tsp  baking soda
                        cornmeal

Combine milk and water in small saucepan. Heat over low heat until liquids are very warm (120-130).

Place 4 cups flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and baking soda in bowl. Attach bowl and dough hook. Turn to speed 2 and mix 15 seconds. Gradually add warm liquids to flour mixture (about 30 seconds). Mix 1 minute longer. Continuing on Speed 2, add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Knead on Speed 2 for 2 minutes longer. Dough will be very sticky. Spread dough into two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pans that have been greased and sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, for 45 minutes.

Bake at 400 F for 25 minutes. Remove from pans immediately and cool on wire racks.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1.5 lb
  1                cup  water
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  red kidney beans, cooked -- drained
     1/4           cup  lentils, cooked -- drained
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  honey
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  bread flour
     3/4           cup  barley flour
     3/4           cup  millet flour
     3/4           cup  spelt flour
  3        tablespoons  gluten flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast

This bread had a surprisingly good taste, considering that a version of it (eaten as barley cakes) was eaten by Ezekiel for a fast for 390 days.

This bread recipe is for Ezekiel bread, which is the recipe God gave Ezekiel in Ezek 4.9 and told him to eat for 390 days. This recipe is made easier in that you can use cooked beans rather than grinding beans as a lot of other Ezekiel bread recipes are. However, a batter bread is probably closer to what Ezekiel actually ate. There are additions such as honey, salt, olive oil, and a little gluten flour to help it out in the bread machine, but then the text doesn't mention the water that would be needed to make bread either. Since I am not good at making bread by hand, I've modified the recipe from the verse for the bread machine. I started with other recipes and modified them for the NKJ version. I used this version because it agrees with Strong's concordance, and others. The Old English in the KJV had fitches, which was translated various ways by some. say is spelt).

"And take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself . . .


Put all ingredients into the bread pan in the order suggested by your bread machine. I use the White Bread setting, Large Loaf (#2 for Oster machine).

This is a bread based on Ezekiel 4:9, New King James Version.

NOTES : This version is adapted for a bread machine, so it is like a regular loaf of bread, not a porridge. It's texture is the same throughout. The beans (including skins) are completely mashed so you wouldn't know there were beans in there. there is an interesting taste you can't quite place that evaporates after a couple of days.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        **Sponge**
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  warm water -- 105-115 F
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
                        plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
                        **Dough**
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        **Topping**
  1              pound  fresh figs (or dried-soaked) -- sliced
     1/3           cup  turbinado sugar
                        plus
  1         tablespoon  turbinado sugar

Stir the yeast and sugar into the warm water in a large mixing or mixer bowl; let stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Beat in the eggs with a wooden spoon or mixer paddle, and stir in the flour in two or three additions by hand or all at once in the mixer. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand until bubbly, about 30 minutes.

Stir the flour and salt into the sponge. Then beat in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time by hand, or all at once with the mixer paddle. Knead the dough by hand for 6 to 7 minutes on a lightly floured surface or for 3 minutes with the dough hook of the mixer. The dough should be sturdy enough to hold a peak if you pinch it.

First Rise: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover it well with plastic wrap, and let it rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

If you are using dried figs, cover them with warm water and soak them for 30 minutes. Drain and pat them dry before using.

Shaping and Second Rise: Stretch the soft, slightly sticky dough out to fit a 10 1/2 x 15 1/2 inch oiled baking sheet. Cover it with a towel, and let it relax for 10 minutes. Then stretch it again so that it truly covers the sheet. Strew the top with the figs and the turbinado sugar, cover with a towel, and leave to rise until not entirely doubled, about 1 hour.

Baking: Preheat the oven to 400 F. If you are using baking stones, preheat them for 30 minutes. Bake the focaccia for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 375 F and continue baking for another 15 minutes, until the top is golden. Cool for a few minutes in the pan, then remove and cool on a rack.

Serves 8 to 10.

                        Sampler Loaf:
     2/3          cups  Water
  1                Tsp  Packed Brown Sugar
  2                Tsp  Butter -- Or Oil
  1                Tsp  Salt
  1 1/2           cups  Dark Rye Flour
  1 1/2           cups  Bread Flour
  1                Tsp  Rapid-Rise Yeast -- Or
                        Active Dry Yeast

This is the simple rye flour bread I grew up with on a farm in northern Minnesota. My mother baked more than twenty loaves of it twice a week!

Regular Loaf
1 C water
2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
1 Tablespoons butter or oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup dark rye flour
2 1/4 cups bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons rapid-rising or active dry yeast

Large Loaf
1 1/3 C water
1 Tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 1/2 Tablespoons butter or oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 C dark rye flour
3 C bread flour
2 teaspoons rapid-rising or active dry yeast

TO MIX THE DOUGH BY HAND Heat the water until warm, between 105F and 115F pour it into a large, warmed bowl, and add the yeast. Let stand 5 minutes, until the yeast begins to bubble. Stir in the brown sugar, butter, salt, and rye flour. Beat well. Slowly add half of the bread flour, and beat until a smooth dough forms. Cover, and let stand 15 minutes Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured board, and knead, adding the remaining flour as necessary, until smooth and springy, about 5 minutes. Wash the bowl and grease it; place the dough back in the bowl, and turn it over to grease the top. Cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

TO MIX THE DOUGH WITH A HEAVY-DUTY MIXER Heat the water until warm, between 105F and 115F pour it into the warmed mixing bowl, and add the yeast. Let stand 5 minutes, until the yeast begins to bubble. Add the brown sugar, butter, salt, and rye flour. Beat well. Slowly add half of the bread flour, and beat until a soft dough forms. Cover, and let stand 15 minutes. Knead the dough in the mixer with the dough book, on medium to high speed, adding the remaining flour as necessary, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is smooth and springy but still soft to the touch. Remove the dough hook, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

TO MIX THE DOUGH IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR Place the plastic dough blade into the work bowl. Heat the water until very warm, between 120F and 130F set aside. place the remaining ingredients into the work bowl. Turn the processor on, and slowly pour the water through the feed tube, processing until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not soft to the touch but is very firm, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time, and process until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. Cover the work bowl, and let the dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Or remove the dough to a lightly, greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

TO MIX THE DOUGH IN THE BREAD MACHINE Pour the water (at room temperature) into the pan. Add the remaining ingredients, in the order listed. Make an indentation in the dry ingredients and add the yeast. Select Dough, and press Start. If the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not soft to the touch but is very firm, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. The machine will stop when the dough is ready to shape and bake.

TO MIX AND BAKE THE BREAD IN THE BREAD MACHINE Pour the water (at room temperature) into the pan. Add the remaining ingredients, in the order listed. Make an indentation in the dry ingredients and add the yeast. Select the Basic or Whole Wheat cycle, set the crust on Medium, and press Start. During the mixing cycle, if the dough is wet and sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch. If the dough is not to the touch but is very firm, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, until the dough is smooth yet soft to the touch.

TO SHAPE AND BAKE IN THE OVEN Lightly grease an 8- or 9-inch round cake pan or a rimless baking sheet. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or lightly oiled surface. Punch the dough down, and shape it into a round loaf. Place the loaf, with the smooth side up, into the pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, 45 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375F Bake 35 to 40 minutes, until the loaf is golden and a wooden skewer inserted into the loaf comes out clean and dry. Brush the top of the loaf while it's still hot with melted butter, if desired. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.

                        Firm Starter For Sourdough

Recipe By     :Kurtis Baguley
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Daily Bread Mailing List
                Starter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2             Oz  Bread Flour -- (1 C)
  8                 Oz  Barm -- (1 C)
                        Water
                        As Needed, Not Too Warm

Yields 12.5 oz of firm starter.

Hand method:

1) Stir together the barm and flour in a mixing bowl until it forms a ball.

2) Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and kneed for about 4 minutes or until all the flour is incorporated and you have a smooth, sticky dough.

3) Place the dough, covered, in a clean, non-reactive bowl and allow to ferment at room temperature for about 4 hours. The dough should show definite signs of rising. Allow it to rise about 50% and then refrigerate it, well covered, overnight.


Mixer method:

1) Combine barm and flour in a mixing bowl and mix on low speed with a dough hook until it forms a ball. Add a few drops of water if necessary to make it come together. The dough should clean the bowl while the mixer is on, and the dough ball should sag off the hook when the mixer is turned off.

2) Mix on high speed for two to three minutes, until the dough appears smooth and homogeneous.

3) Place the dough, covered, in a clean, non-reactive bowl and allow to ferment at room temperature for about 4 hours. The dough should show definite signs of rising. Allow it to rise about 50% and then refrigerate it, well covered, overnight.

NOTES : Recently we attended a class "San Francisco Sourdough vs. the French Levain", given by Chef Kurtis Baguley. It was an incredible class!! He has graciously given permission for us to post the recipes from the class. If you ever have the opportunity to take a class from Kurtis, don't pass up the chance.

Here are the recipes for the San Francisco sourdough and the barm and firm starter. The recipe for the French levain will follow next week. Since the barm will take you a week to make, you don't really need either of the bread recipes until then, but here is one anyway.

Flatbreads come from every corner of the world, with variations as diverse as the cultures from which they originate. Their increased availability and our exposure to them has transformed the American sandwich. No longer are our choices limited to wheat, rye, sourdough and soggy.

Stuffed flatbreads are actually better when made a couple hours ahead and wrapped tightly. As the zesty flavors of the fillings are absorbed, the breads soften but still hold their shapes.

Tortillas: These thin round flatbreads from Mexico are made with unleavened wheat flour or cornmeal dough. Use the round burrito-sized flour tortillas for stuffing and wrapping because they roll easily into self-contained packages. Although it's not necessary to heat the tortillas before using, it does bring out their flavor and makes them more pliable. You can put each tortilla into a hot dry skillet for about 7 seconds on each side. Or stack the tortillas between two damp paper towels and microwave for about 10 seconds per tortilla. Wrap the tortillas in a clean kitchen towel after heating to keep them pliable.

Pita bread: The traditional pocket bread from eastern Mediterranean countries. When the dough puffs during baking, then deflates when cooled, a pocket is formed. Check the expiration date on the package as this bread dries out quickly. Store in the refrigerator, or freeze for later use. It's not necessary to heat pitas before stuffing. To fill, cut a thin strip from the top of the pita, or cut in halves.

Lavash: This flatbread has its origins in Armenia. It's pliable enough to roll without heating first. Store in the refrigerator if using within a day or so, but freeze for longer storage. If it does dry out, heat in a microwave for 5 seconds to soften. To fill, lay the fillings in a thick horizontal strip about a third of the way up, then roll. Or scatter the fillings over the bread, leaving about a half-inch around the edge and roll.

Focaccia: The thin, chewy bread of Italy can be found flavored with herbs, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and caramelized onions. The plain brown-and-serve focaccia are a little thicker, and are a good choice for vinaigrette-dressed fillings that can soak into the bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  yeast
  1                cup  water -- (100 to 115 F.)
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  semolina or corn meal
  1                cup  unbleached all purpose flour
  2               cups  unbleached bread flour
                        olive oil or cooking spray to grease

Place water, yeast, honey, olive oil, semolina (or corn meal) and bread flour in a large bowl or electric mixing bowl with a dough hook. Stir to blend and let rest a moment of two. Stir in salt, than remaining all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. Knead with dough hook or by hand to form a soft, but not-too sticky dough (8-12 minutes). Remove from bowl, lightly oil or spray top of dough and allow to rest, covered with a tea towel, for about 45 minutes.

Deflate dough very gently before using and allow dough to rest for another 15 minutes. Otherwise, you may refrigerate the dough in an oiled plastic bag for up to two days.

Flatten dough gently to make a generously 15 inch round. Sprinkle a large cookie sheet or a 16 inch aluminum pizza pan or rectangular baking sheet lightly with semolina or cornmeal. Dimple top of dough with fingertips. Drizzle with olive oil, dust with salt and coarse black pepper and shavings of fresh garlic or sauteed onions.

Preheat grill to "Medium". Place baking sheet or pan on grill and close cover. Allow bread to "set up" a couple minutes. Reduce heat to "Low". With a metal spatula, ease bread directly onto grill. Bake until done (another 5-8 minutes). If at any time, the bread seems to be cooking too quickly, reduce heat.

If you want this dough ready for supper and are out all day, use only 1/2 teaspoon yeast. Prepare dough and cover (or leave in bread machine) and allow for a long rise throughout the day.
This recipe is a good way to begin breads-on-the-grill baking.  Recipe from http://www.betterbaking.com/breadgrillrec.html Posted to

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  white sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  all purpose flour -- (3 1/2 to 4)
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine

In a large bowl combine the yeast, sugar, 1 teaspoon of the salt and 1 1/2 cups of the flour. In a sauce pan combine the milk, water and 1/4 cup of the butter or margarine until 110 degrees F (38 degrees C). Add milk mixture and vinegar to the flour mixture and blend at low speed of the mixer until moistened. Beat at medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups additional flour to form a sticky dough. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and Knead adding 1/2 to 1 cup more of flour until dough is smooth and pliable. Place dough in a greased bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume. Punch down dough and roll into a rectangle shape about 16x8 inches. In a saucepan heat the onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, parsley and 2 tablespoons butter or margarine until butter or margarine is melted. Spread over the dough rectangle and starting from the 16 inch side roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll. Place the bread seam side down onto a greased cookie sheet!

                        Dry Ingredients:
  1                cup  brown rice flour
  2               cups  white rice flour
  3 1/2           tsp.  xanthan gum
     1/2          tsp.  salt
     1/4          tsp.  cinnamon -- (1/4 to 1/2)
  1 1/3           cups  instant nonfat dry milk powder
  1                cup  raisins -- dark or light
  1            package  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2       tablespoons.  brown sugar
                        Wet Ingredients:
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  1                cup  fresh apples -- finely diced
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  margarine -- melted

Mix 1/4 cup of the 1/2 cup sugar with the diced apples and allow to sit for about 20 - 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The apples and the sugar will make a syrup. This mixtures now becomes part of the wet ingredients.

Mix all dry ingredients together. Mix all wet ingredients together. Place dry and wet ingredients into your bread machine in the order the manufacturer suggests. Note: If your machine has a designated time to add nuts and fruits, add raisins at that time. Note: The apples seem to work well, if dices are about the size of raisins. Slices of apples seem to stick to the sides of the baking container as they are kneaded. They don't incorporate into the dough. When baking the slices, they seem to all be on the edge of the bread and burn rapidly. Dicing seems to be the trick here. Use the fruit bread setting.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- up to 4 1/2
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  Asiago Cheese -- shredded
                        OR Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  fresh chives -- snipped
  1                     egg white -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  water
  1              whole  green onion
  1                     white-part  leek -- thinly sliced
                        fresh chives
                        Italian parsley sprigs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

In a large mixing bowl stir together 2 cups of the flour and the yeast; set aside.

In a medium saucepan heat and stir milk, sugar, margarine or butter, and salt just until warm (120 to 130 degrees) and margarine almost melts. Add milk mixture to dry mixture along with the two eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in cheese, snipped chives, and as much of the remaining flour as you can.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape the dough into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once. Cover; let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until dough is double in size.

Pinch dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough into 4 portions. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease 2 baking sheets.

Shape dough by gently pulling each portion of the dough into a 10 x 4 1/2 inch rectangle. Place on prepared baking sheets. In a small bowl, stir together egg white and water. Brush loaves with egg white mixture.

To decorate the loaves:
Gently press green onion into one loaf. Arrange leek slices on a second loaf. Place several whole chives on a third loaf. Top remaining loaf with parsley sprigs. Gently brush onion, chives, leeks, and parsley with olive oil to prevent them from drying out. Cover and let rise in a warm place until dough is nearly double in size (about 45 minutes).

Preheat oven to 375F. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden. (If necessary, cover loosely with foil the last 5 minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning.) Remove from baking sheets; cool on wire racks. Makes 4 loaves (16 servings)

Sugar is the last dry ingredient added. Warm the water-gelatin mixture to 85 degrees in a microwave or on the stove top. Add to the machine with the remaining wet ingredients. The amount of water is based upon the degree of moisture desired in the finished loaf and type of flour used. There is no problem with overflowing of the loaf with 1 3/4 cups of water. Press start. Multi- logic settings: Kneading - 0, Rising - 20, Baking - 50. The bread can be made in the Model 100's four hour cycle. Allow to cool before slicing.

This is a wonderful, moist sandwich bread or foundation for other breads. It comes in four variations to accommodate different tastes. It can be made lactose free by using dry milk substitute instead of non-fat dry milk. This bread does not require premixing of ingredients. Sure-Jell from Kraft Foods, is pectin. It is normally used in making home jellies. The dough can be remove from the machine and used to make hamburger buns.

                  How To Prepare Tile For Baking Stones

Recipe By     :Charel Scheele,Old World Breads
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

harel Scheele's "Old World Breads" ((c) 1997, Crossing Press) has a very practical solution for baking stones: giant flower pot saucers.

Granted, it may not be as elegant as a custom-cut tile or a stone from some glam baking outfitter, but it is simple and effective.

The saucer should be big enough so that the sides of the dough do not touch the sides of the saucer, only the bottom.

A 12" diameter saucer will be big enough for any recipe using 6 cups of flour or less.

He advises against using glazed clay dishes because that loses the brick oven effect. It's a golden crust thing.

To prepare your saucer:

1.) wash it and let it dry thoroughly.
2.) grease the inside with vegetable shortening (it spreads and is absorbed
more easily than oil).
3.) place the saucer in a cold oven and turn the oven to 250-degrees and
bake for 20 minutes.
4.) then increase the temperature to 350 and bake for another 20 minutes.
5.) increase the temp. to 450 and bake for another 20 minutes.
6.) turn the oven off and let the saucer cool in the oven for 2 hours.
7.) after the saucer's cooled, scrub it with hot water -- do not use soap.
Do not grease it again or it will lose its porosity.

Before each baking use, put the saucer in the cold oven 10 minutes before
use.  Preheat the oven to 400.  When it reaches 400, *carefully* remove the
saucer, sprinkle it liberally with cornmeal and place your round loaf in
it.  Return saucer and dough to oven and bake until golden brown.

Pot's all, folks (pun intended).

  5               cups  All-Purpose Flour -- to 5 1/2 C, OR
                        bread flour
  1               cups  milk
     1/2          cups  water
  6               Tbsp  unsalted butter
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  Raisins -- dark
     1/3          cups  Liqueur -- amaretto
  24                Oz  poppy seed filling -- *Note
                        powdered sugar -- for dusting

In a large mixing bowl with a whisk or bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, combine yeast, sugar, lemon zest, salt and 2 cups flour. In a small saucepan, combine milk, water and butter. Heat until just warm. Stir to melt butter. Let cool to 120F.

Add milk and eggs to dry mixture and beat hard 1 minute, or until creamy. Add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time to form a soft dough that just clears sides of bowl, switching to a wooden spoon if necessary if making by hand.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, springy and soft, about 3 minutes, adding flour 1 tablespoon at a time as necessary to prevent sticking. Transfer to a deep, greased container, turn once to coat top and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Place raisins and Amaretto in a small bowl to soak.

Drain raisins, reserving liqueur. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide in half. Pat or roll out each section into a 9-by-14-inch rectangle. Leaving a 1-inch border on all sides, spread each section evenly with a can of poppy seed filling. Sprinkle with half the drained raisins. Roll up from short end and pinch seams to seal. Place each roll seam-side down in a greased 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.

Brush tops with a bit of reserved liqueur. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise until 1 inch above rim of pans, about 40 minutes. Twenty minutes before baking, preheat oven to 350F.

Bake in center of oven 40-45 minutes, until golden brown and hollow sounding when tapped with your finger. Remove from pans to cool completely on racks before slicing. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.

Makes 2 loaves.

*NOTE: Poppy seed filling is available in baking sections of supermarkets.

                      Indian Nan Bread, On The Grill

Recipe By     :BetterBaking.com
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                Hand Made                       International Breads
                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  5          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  - scant - beaten egg
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
                        OR vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  heavy or 15% cream - room temp
     1/4           cup  milk - room temp
  2               cups  bread flour
  4               cups  all purpose flour -- unbleached
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt

In a large mixing bowl fitted with a dough hook (or use bread machine), whisk together the yeast, water, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Whisk in remaining sugar, egg and oil. Stir in cream and milk and most of the flour (reserve one cup), baking powder and salt. Stir to make a soft dough. Attach dough hook (or knead by hand) and make a soft, supple dough, adding more flour as required (10 to 15 minutes).

Place in a lightly oiled plastic bag and let rest until doubled, or refrigerate overnight (you may keep dough refrigerated for up to four days). Allow to come to room temperature before using (bread will rise up as it warms).

Break dough off in pieces around the size of a grapefruit. Let rest a minute or so, then roll into rounds about the size of your hand. Stretch gently lengthwise and sideways to make a teardrop shaped slab. Place dough slabs on a cookie sheet and cover with a tea towel. Let rest 10-15 minutes.

Preheat gas grill to hottest temperature (500 F.).

Place nan slabs on grill and put cover down. Bake until dough puffs up, (3 to 5 minutes). Using tongs, turn over bread to cook other side, for another 3 to 5 minutes. Dough may look scorched in areas but this is OK.

Serve immediately, or cover in foil and keep warm on the warming section of the grill.

Note: Most recipes for nan call for yogurt and milk, but this version is similar to ones I have enjoyed in Indian restaurants. This recipe is adapted from the one generously provided by Montreal's landmark Bombay Palace Restaurant. Rustic, chewy, addictive - this is perfect for a mountain of tandoori chicken or just about any main dish. From http://www.betterbaking.com/breadgrillrec.html Posted to BreadBakers

Sugar is the last dry ingredient added. Warm the water-gelatin mixture to 85 degrees in a microwave or on the stove top. Add to the machine with the remaining wet ingredients. The amount of water is based upon the degree of moisture desired in the finished loaf and type of flour used. There is no problem with overflowing of the loaf with 1 3/4 cups of water. Press start.

This is a wonderful, moist sandwich bread or foundation for other breads. It comes in four variations to accommodate different tastes. It can be made lactose free by using dry milk substitute instead of non-fat dry milk. This bread does not require premixing of ingredients. Sure-Jell from Kraft Foods, is pectin. It is normally used in making home jellies. The dough can be remove from the machine and used to make hamburger buns.

BTW, my friend who doesn't eat wheat flour (she's on some strange diet, not allergic to gluten) says WHITE spelt flour is darned close to white wheat flour and she has successfully substituted it one-for-one in some recipes for wheat flour, and without adding anything else to bind the recipe. She says white spelt is not to be confused with organic (brown) spelt (I've never seen it so I'm not sure what she means by this) and is available from specialty stores. She gets hers at a health food store, and it is made by Bob's Red Mill.

Now, I have a recipe request. When she went on this strange diet, she gave me all of her other flours, including two pounds of some incredibly beautiful stone-ground whole wheat that she bought at Smoky Mountain Nat'l Park (I think that's what it's called) where it is ground in an old fashioned mill as a demonstration for visitors of what life was like for the original settlers. There are a few other nice flours, including oat flour and stone-ground cornmeal. I'm looking for LOTS of recipes for multi-grain breads... (I hope I can eat it all before these flours go rancid!)

  1             recipe  for French Country Bread
                        OR a 2lb loaf frozen white bread dough
                        (defrost frozen dough)
                        **FILLING**
     1/4           cup  flat leaf parsley -- finely minced
     1/4           cup  minced onions
                        and/or scallions
     3/4           cup  sun dried tomatoes -- minced
                        (about 8 pumped halves)
  3             medium  garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1                cup  chopped black olives -- chopped
                        (combo oil cured -- calamata or pitted
                        -- black
  4             ounces  feta cheese -- in small chunks
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano -- (up to 1 tsp)
     1/2      teaspoon  basil -- (up to 1 tsp)

In a medium bowl, toss together the parsley, onions/scallions, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, olives, feta cheese chunks, olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano and basil.

Flatten or gently deflate bread dough into an oval shape (1/2 to 3/4 inch thick). Press half of topping mixture onto bread. Fold bread into center and pinch dough together to cover filling. Let rest a few minutes. Flatten again, using a rolling pin, trying not to force any filling out. Press remaining filling into dough. Fold dough over again, into center, pinching dough together to cover any exposed filling. Bread should look like a plumpish, slightly flattened oval. Smear a little olive oil on bread.

Line a doubled-up cookie sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle with semolina. Place bread on sheet and cover with tea towel. Let rise about 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours - until puffy.

Preheat grill to "Hot". Place bread on grill, close cover, reduce heat to "Medium" and bake 35-40 minutes, until bread is well browned. Some of the filling may leak out but that is OK. Remove from grill.

Serve in warm wedges or cold, in thin slices. Keep warm on the warming section of the grill. - - - - - This is pure picnic and party fare - zesty and chock full of summery tastes. Good hot or cold. Thin cold slabs work well as appetizers with wine or sangria, warm big wedges make a salad a meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***Zataar lemon and oil topping***
     1/4           cup  zataar spice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        two lemons -- juice of
     3/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
                        **BREAD**
  1         tablespoon  yeast
  2               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2               cups  unbleached all purpose flour
  5               cups  unbleached bread flour
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt

For topping, stir together all ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

For bread, whisk together yeast, water and sugar. Stir in oil and most of flour (reserve 1 cup of whole wheat), then salt. Knead 8-10 minutes to form an elastic, supple dough, adding reserved flour as required.

Place dough in a well greased large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a tea towel and let rise, until doubled. Otherwise, allow dough a long, cool rise in the refrigerator for several hours or longer (up to three days). Bring dough to room temperature before using (it will rise as it warms).

Break off sections of dough, about the size of a grapefruit. Stretch or roll into irregular slabs. Let rest 15 minutes, covered with a tea towel. Spoon on some olive/zataar mixture.

Preheat grill to "Hot". Lay slabs gently on grill. Close cover for one to two minutes, then check doneness. Allow to bake until tops begin to brown. Brush with additional topping if desired.

Variation: Spicy Middle Eastern Pizza - - - - This is my favorite flatbread. It is good alone or with a good smear of hummus, Lebanese yogurt, or simply topped with fresh tomatoes, salt, pepper and olive oil. You can make your own zataar spice or look for it in a Middle Eastern market.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4          cups  Whole Millet
     1/2          cups  Millet Flour
  2               cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
     1/3          cups  Vegetable Shortening
     5/8          cups  Milk -- (1/2 C+2 Tbsp)
  1               Tbsp  Honey

Millet is an excellent grain which is too often overlooked. It adds both texture and a sweet flavor. These simple crackers are splendid with a fresh fruit salad.

Preheat the oven to 350F.

Stir together the millet, flours and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Warm the milk in a small saucepan. Dissolve the honey in the warm milk. Add this sweetened milk to the flour mixture and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add a little more milk.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, maximum 1/8". With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 2" squares and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 10 min. Turn over and continue baking another 10 - 15 min, or until med brown. Cool on a rack.

Yield: 75 - 85

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 pound loaf
  1               cups  warm water
  4        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk powder
  1 1/4            tsp  salt
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  honey
     1/4          cups  barley flour
     1/4          cups  rye flour
     1/4          cups  millet flour
  2        tablespoons  corn meal
  2               cups  bread flour -- *
  1        tablespoons  bread enhancer
  1 1/2            tsp  SAF instant yeast
                        -- or 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast

Use DOUGH cycle. Dough should ball and not be sticky at all. Remove dough from machine BEFORE rising starts to a greased and covered bowl to rise.
Shape loaf and place in greased 9x5 pan. Bake at 325 F for 25-30 minutes. Loaf should reach 200F internally.

* You may need more bread flour than this. You may also try using less liquid at first. Just have it nearby if you need it during the mix cycle.

This loaf will NOT bake properly in the ABM. Don't let rise in it for the same reason. If you do, expect a rather gooey doorstop.

"Original Ratios":
1 Pound Loaf
1 Cup White Bread flour
1/4 Cup Barley flour
1/4 Cup Millet flour
1/4 Cup Rye flour
1/4 Cup Corn meal

1 1/2 Pound loaf
1 1/2 Cup White Bread flour
3/8 Cup Barley flour
3/8 Cup Millet flour
3/8 Cup Rye flour
3/8 Cup Corn meal

3/8 cup is a quarter cup plus two Tablespoons.

Following these in ABM makes a very heavy, gummy loaf. Corn meal is the
likely culprit.

                Nutritious Additions To Whole Wheat Breads

                 *****

Nutritious Additions To Whole Wheat Breads

Soy flour: One Tbsp per loaf is enough to enrich and compliment wheat protein without changing the flavor.

Milk: Dry milk powder can be mixed into the flour (1/4 to 1/2 cup per recipe.) Fluid milk can replace water. Modern milk does not need to be scalded, just warmed to the proper temperature. Buttermilk and yogurt tenderize bread and improve its keeping quality.

Whole or Cracked Grains: These add texture, flavor interest and sometimes improved nutrition. Try adding up to 2/3 cup of one or a combination of the following:

* cornmeal
* bulgar
* triticale (crack and then boil 5 mins to soften)
* farina
* semolina
* Malt-o-Meal
* steel cut oats (boil 5 mins.)
* regular rolled oats (or wheat flakes or rye flakes)
* oat bran
* flax seed (crack and boil 5 mins.)

Eggs: For a light, high loaf add a beaten egg (or two whites) to the dough. This makes a dramatic difference and so I almost always add an egg when I am taking bread to a dinner party. Everyone is expecting dense, heavy, but healthy bread. Boy, are they surprised! If you don't want to use dairy or eggs in your bread, try using a small amount of soy lecithin dissolved in the oil. I haven't tried this yet, but I believe it will work because I believe the effect of the egg is due as much to the small amount of lecithin in egg yolk as is it to the albumen in the egg white.
Variations

The above should give you some ideas for creating your own "signature" breads. Don't hesitate to vary recipes to make them more interesting. I seldom follow a recipe; I just start mixing, keeping in mind the usual proportions of basic ingredients. Sometimes the contents of my cupboard dictate my variations, sometimes it's just a whim.

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Daily Bread Mailing List
                Sourdough Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                Oz  Bread Flour -- (3 C)
  8                 Oz  Water -- (1 C)
  6                 Oz  Firm Starter -- or
                        Firm Mild Starter
     1/8            Oz  Diastatic Malt -- (1/2 Tsp)
     1/4            Oz  Salt -- (1 1/2 Tsp)

Yields 26 oz loaf.

Day 1:

Make the firm starter.

Day 2:

1) Remove firm starter from refrigerator and allow to warm one to two hours.

2) Mix water, flour and malt on low speed and adjust water to get a shaggy dough. This fully hydrates the flour. Allow mixture to rest 15 minutes.

3) Add starter and mix with bowl lowered some to get better mixing. Then mix at high speed (4.5 on Kitchen Aid mixer) while slowly adding salt. Trickle in water from fingers if necessary. Mix about four minutes.

Salt is table grind. The equivalent volume of kosher salt is twice the table grind volume. The weights of the two are the same.

4) Bulk ferment approximately 3 hours, reforming after about 1.5 hours.

5) Scale: cut to size and form into round loaf.

6) Bench: lightly spray with oil and cover with plastic wrap, allow to stand 30 minutes.

7) Shape: sprinkle flour on couch (linen cloth or towel - embed flour into nap of cloth if it is not smooth). Form loaf on couch and sprinkle with flour. Cover with couch and plastic.

8) Proof: allow to rise 1.5 times.

9) Refrigerate overnight.

Day 3:

1) Remove from refrigerator and continue to proof until ready.

2) Score and bake in a 450 F oven with steam. Start baking at 475 F for 15 minutes. Steam with two big spoons of boiling water. Lower temperature to 400 F and continue baking for a total oven time of 40 minutes.

NOTES : This bread is more properly made with firm mild starter which is less sour than the firm starter recipe posted previously. The directions for making the mild starter are in the sourdough section of Peter Reinhart's book, "Crust & Crumb".

Here is the last recipe from Kurtis.  It is the Pain Au Levain bread and it is really wonderful!!

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  1                Tsp  Coarsely Ground Pepper
  1                Tsp  Sugar
  2               Tbsp  Oil
     1/4          cups  Water -- To 1/2 C
  2               Tbsp  Lemon Juice

If saltines don't excite you, try pepperines. They're good by themselves, and they spice up soups, stews, and dips.

Preheat the oven to 350F.

Mix the flour, salt, pepper, and sugar in a large bowl or in the food processor. Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Combine 1/4 C of the water and the lemon juice in a small bowl. Blend it into the flour mixture. Add enough of the remaining 1/4 C water to for a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll each in a rectangular shape. The dough should be as thin as possible, 1/16" at the most.

Using a spatula, rolling pin, or your hands, pick up the rolled dough and transfer it onto an ungreased baking sheet. With a sharp knife, score into 2" squares. Do not cut all the way through to the baking sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with a fork.

Bake 15 - 20 min, turning over after 10 min or when the edges begin to brown. Cool on a rack. Bread into individual crackers.

Yield: 75 - 85

Variations:
If a hotter cracker is desired, add more pepper. For red-hot crackers, sprinkle 1/8 - 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper on top of the dough before making the final pass with your rolling pin.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           Cup  Light Red Wine -- Or White Wine
                        (such as Ruspo from Cappezzana)
     3/4           Cup  Warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  Active dry yeast
  1         Tablespoon  Honey
  3 1/2           Cups  All-purpose flour
  1           Teaspoon  Salt
  2        Tablespoons  Olive oil -- divided

Place wine, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved. Add honey, salt and olive oil and mix through. Add 1 cup flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter. Add 2 more cups of flour and stir in as much as you can with the wooden spoon (2 to 3 minutes).

Bring dough together with your hands and turn out onto floured board or marble surface. Knead about 6 to 8 minutes until you have made a smooth, firm dough. Place in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

For individual pizzas or calzones, cut the dough into four equal pieces and knead into rounds. For one large pizza, knead into one large round. For both, let rest 15 minutes.

This recipe yields enough dough for 4 servings.

You don't need to become apprenticed, you just need to let the dough rise again. After letting your pizza dough rise the first time, punch it down, then divide into however many pizzas you want to make from the batch. Form into round 'boules' being careful to maintain a nice skin (I form these by carefully pushing the dough up through the bottom until I'm satisfied with the shape), then COVER and let double in size. I find that an inverted bowl works fine, although you might want to try the floured cloth technique. When the dough has risen again, it will be gassy. DON'T roll it out. Use your fingers to poke it into an approximate round shape, deflating all the major gas bubbles. It's reasonably easy to then stretch the round disk with your knuckles, then to throw the slack dough with a spinning motion in the air, further stretching it and catching it on your bent knuckles, and yes, this is exactly how the 'experts' do it. It helps if you say, repeatedly, "Mamma mia, atsa spicy meatball!" for verisimilitude. It will take you approximately three times to become a veteran at this. Most people have problems with pizza dough because they 1) roll out the dough, squishing all the little bubbles that make good pizza and 2) try to work with freshly kneaded dough, instead of letting it rise and become slack.

It is also worth noting that it is better to have a less sticky dough. Pizza dough needs to have a higher flour/liquid ratio than many breads, and also benefits from high gluten, the higher the better, as long as it is thoroughly kneaded. You should be able to stretch good pizza dough so thin it's translucent, although you don't have to bake it that way.

                 *****

This is my first time jumping into the list, but pizza making is a subject I know a little about, so I couldn't resist. Most people go wrong in shaping pizza dough by not making a wet-enough dough (it should be really sticky) and by not letting it rest for a long enough time before shaping it. (I should add that I come by this advice from learning about pizza-making from Neapolitan pizzaiolo for my upcoming book on artisan bread baking.)

After making the dough, immediately cut it into pizza-sized portions (about 7 ounces or 200 grams each), and tightly roll them up into smooth rounds. Flour them, and place them to proof in a well-floured pan, covering them with plastic wrap so they do not crust over. While they are proofing, make your sauce, prepare all the topping ingredients, and get your pizza stone as hot as your oven will allow on the second-to-top rack (true Neapolitan pizza is baked for no more than 4 minutes at 750F, so there is no way to get the oven too hot).

If your dough is puffy and soft and has risen for at least one hour (most great pizza makers prefer to use very little yeast and let the dough proof for 5 to 6 hours), it is ready to shape. DO NOT PUNCH THE DOUGH DOWN. Pat the dough between your hands until it is a thin disk, then gently pull it out into a circle, stretching it with your hands and leaving the edge just slightly thicker. The pizza should be about 1/4 inch thick. Rolling pins are not allowed for Neapolitan pizza: it ruins the air cells in the dough. This will be very simple to do if your dough is fully proofed and your dough was wet enough. Now top it and peel it into the oven.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  All-Purpose Flour
     3/4           Tsp  Salt
  1               Tbsp  Baking Powder
     1/4          cups  Shortening -- Plus
  2               Tbsp  Shortening
  1 1/2           cups  Water
                        Salt -- For Tops (Optional)

These crackers cannot truly duplicate the lightness of traditional soda crackers, but they take a fraction of the time to make, and they are delicious in their own right. Plain, slightly biscuity crackers, they go well with soups or stews.

Preheat the oven to 350F

In the food processor or a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Cut the shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the water, little by little and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for tolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to a rectangle approx 1/4" thick and position so the long edge runs horizontally in front of you. Fold the left third of the dough over the center third. Likewise, fold the right third over the center. The dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically. Give the dough a quarter turn so the seam now runs horizontally. Roll out again to a rectangle about 1/4" thick. Fold and turn the dough again as in the first step. You are now ready for the final rolling.

Roll the dough out somewhat thinner this time, about 1/8" thick. If desired, sprinkle the top lightly and evenly with salt and roll over it lightly with the rolling pin. With a sharp knife, cut into 2" squares and place them on an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 25 - 30 min, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.

Yield: 80 - 85

                Sourdough Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14                Oz  Bread Flour -- (3 C)
  8                 Oz  Water -- (1 C)
  12 1/2            Oz  Firm Starter
     1/2            Oz  Diastatic Malt -- (1 Tsp)
     3/8            Oz  Salt -- (0.4 Oz, 2 1/4 Tsp)

Yields 35 oz loaf.

Day 1:

Make the firm starter.

Day 2:

1) Remove firm starter from refrigerator and allow to warm one to two hours.

2) Mix water, flour and malt on low speed and adjust water to get a shaggy dough. This fully hydrates the flour. Allow mixture to rest 15 minutes.

3) Add starter and mix with bowl lowered some to get better mixing. Then mix at high speed (4.5 on Kitchen Aid mixer) while slowly adding salt. Trickle in water from fingers if necessary. Mix about four minutes.

Salt is table grind. The equivalent volume of kosher salt is twice the table grind volume. The weights of the two are the same.

4) Bulk ferment approximately 3 hours, reforming after about 1.5 hours.

5) Scale: cut to size and form into round loaf.

6) Bench: lightly spray with oil and cover with plastic wrap, allow to stand 30 minutes.

7) Shape: sprinkle flour on couch (linen cloth or towel - embed flour into nap of cloth if it is not smooth). Form loaf on couch and sprinkle with flour. Cover with couch and plastic.

8) Proof: allow to rise 1.5 times.

9) Refrigerate overnight.

Day 3:

1) Remove from refrigerator and continue to proof until ready.

2) Score and bake in a 450 F oven with steam. Start baking at 475 F for 15 minutes. Steam with two big spoons of boiling water. Lower temperature to 400 F and continue baking for a total oven time of 40 minutes.

NOTES : Recently we attended a class "San Francisco Sourdough vs. the French Levain", given by Chef Kurtis Baguley. It was an incredible class!! He has graciously given permission for us to post the recipes from the class. If you ever have the opportunity to take a class from Kurtis, don't pass up the chance.

Here are the recipes for the San Francisco sourdough and the barm and firm starter. The recipe for the French levain will follow next week. Since the barm will take you a week to make, you don't really need either of the bread recipes until then, but here is one anyway. _____

Sugar is the last dry ingredient added. Warm the water-gelatin mixture to 85 degrees in a microwave or on the stove top. Add to the machine with the remaining wet ingredients. The amount of water is based upon the degree of moisture desired in the finished loaf and type of flour used. There is no problem with overflowing of the loaf with 1 3/4 cups of water. Press start. Multi- logic settings: Kneading - 0, Rising - 20, Baking - 50. The bread can be made in the Model 100's four hour cycle. Allow to cool before slicing.

This is a wonderful, moist sandwich bread or foundation for other breads. It comes in four variations to accommodate different tastes. It can be made lactose free by using dry milk substitute instead of non-fat dry milk. This bread does not require premixing of ingredients. Sure-Jell from Kraft Foods, is pectin. It is normally used in making home jellies. The dough can be remove from the machine and used to make hamburger buns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  honey -- or light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  butter -- or shortening
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- up to 2 tablespoons
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
  1              large  egg

Bread Machine Method: Scald the milk, and let it cool to lukewarm. Place all of the ingredients, including the lukewarm milk, into the pan of your bread machine in the order directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Program the machine for manual or dough, and press start. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. If the dough isn't doubled by the end of the cycle, allow it to remain in the machine for 30 minutes more, or until it's doubled.

Shaping: Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface and knead briefly, then divide it into 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, and let the balls rest, covered, for 15 minutes. Roll each ball into an 8-10 inch round; the dough will be very thin.

Heat a griddle or heavy non-stick pan over medium heat. Lightly brush the pan with oil. Dry-fry each bread for 1 1/2-2 minutes per side; the breads should remain mostly white on the first side, and have small brown patches on the second side. Transfer each round to a rack to cool, then wrap tightly to store.

NOTES : I found it there a couple of years ago and have been using the dough recipe since. When I went to the site today to copy it I noticed the meat filling portion had been added. Will have to try that also. We have always considered them a dessert until now. We enjoy them hot and fresh, stuffed with soft ice cream. We were introduced to sopapias at the Ponchos Mexican Food chain in far south Texas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        One Recipe Middle Eastern Flatbread dough
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- up to 3
     1/2         pound  lean ground beef
     1/4           cup  parsley -- minced
  2          teaspoons  red pepper sauce
                        OR hot sauce
     1/2           cup  onion -- grated
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  canned tomatoes -- minced finely
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        salt and pepper to taste
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
                        OR pomegranate molasses -- (Cortas is good)

In a skillet, brown the meat in the oil. Stir in parsley and onion and allow onions to soften. Add remaining ingredients. Adjust seasonings.

Pre-heat grill to "Medium".

Prepare dough in very thin 8 inch rounds. Smear with a touch of olive oil. Cover rounds and let rest five minutes. Spread a portion of filling on top of each.

To bake, start on a cookie sheet then transfer directly to grill. Baking could take as little as 3 to 5 minutes depending on thickness. Keep an eye on them.

This variation makes for a spicy, mildly meaty spread that turns a small flatbread into something special. Middle Eastern spice stores have all the spices you need. Substitutions are noted. These can be made in advance and reheated. The topping should be applied modestly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  250            grams  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        -- (2 sticks + 2 tbsp butter)
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey -- plus
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1              whole  egg
  1                     egg yolk
     1/2           cup  milk -- plus
  2          teaspoons  milk
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
  1 3/4           cups  fine yellow cornmeal -- plus
  1         tablespoon  fine yellow cornmeal -- plus
  1           teaspoon  fine yellow cornmeal
  3 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract
                        Or almond oil
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar -- (approx.)
     1/2           cup  confectioner's sugar

By Mixer Only:
Using the whisk attachment on your mixer, if you have one, beat the butter, 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar, and the honey for 1 to 2 minutes at low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until light and fluffy. Add the egg, egg yolk, and 2 teaspoons milk and continue beating for 1 minute. Mix in the flour, cornmeal, and baking powder. Add 1/2 cup milk and the almond oil and mix at the lowest speed until blended. The dough should be stiff but not heavy. Knead briefly by hand or mixer, sprinkling with additional flour as needed, until buttery, soft, pliable, and slightly sticky.

Shaping:
Line baking sheets with parchment paper or buttered brown paper. Cut the dough into 15 equal pieces (3 ounces or 90 grams each). Flour your hands and roll each piece into a ball. Flatten each ball into a 1/2 inch thick patty, the size of a hamburger and the width of a woman's hand. Place on the paper-lined baking sheets.

Glazing:
Brush the tops with water and then sprinkle with granulated sugar, making sure a thin layer of sugar covers each bun. You can shake off the excess sugar by holding on to the paper and shaking the sugar up and over the edge of the pan. Place the confectioner's sugar in a sifter or sieve and sift the sugar heavily over the buns so that they look as if they're lost in a blizzard of sugar. The excess powdered sugar can stay on the paper, because it will not caramelize.

Baking:
Heat the oven to 375 F. Bake until the sugar on top has cracked into an irregular design, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on racks. Makes 15 buns. --
These sweet buns are a very delicate cross between a corn muffin and a scone. They are particularly appealing because the covering on the top cracks into a pattern that looks like the land after a long dry summer. Meini are definitely a Lombard specialty, and the Milanese traditionally eat them on April 24th as a celebration of the liberation of their countryside from the assaults of a ferocious highwayman and his brigands during the Middle Ages.

In a bowl, soak the gelatin in water for two minutes. Set aside. Add the yeast to the machine. Add the flours, dry milk, gum, Sure-Jell, and salt to the machine. Sugar is the last dry ingredient added. Warm the water-gelatin mixture to 85 degrees in a microwave or on the stove top. Add to the machine with the remaining wet ingredients. The amount of water is based upon the degree of moisture desired in the finished loaf and type of flour used. There is no problem with overflowing of the loaf with 1 3/4 cups of water. Press start. Multi- logic settings: Kneading - 0, Rising - 20, Baking - 50. The bread can be made in the Model 100's four hour cycle. Allow to cool before slicing.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  Finely Ground Yellow Cornmeal
                        Preferably From A Health Food Store
  1                Cup  All-Purpose Flour
     3/4           Cup  Powdered Sugar

  1               Tbsp  Pure Vanilla
  5               Tbsp  Melted Unsalted Butter

From time to time, my friend Beth Hensperger, who has written several bread books, sends me recipes she thinks I'll love. This is one of them. In fact, I'm addicted to this cornbread. It's good hot or cold, and leftovers are marvelous cut into thick slices, then toasted and slathered with butter.

Preheat oven to 375F. Grease a 8-inch square baking pan or mist with baker's spray or oil.

Combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl; whisk to blend. Combine the eggs, buttermilk and vanilla in a bowl and whisk to blend. Add to the dry ingredients, then pour the melted butter over the top. Stir until the ingredients are just blended. Be careful not to overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, until golden around the edges, and a cake tester comes out clean when inserted into the center.

Cut into squares and serve warm with butter. Serves 4.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/4           Tsp  Salt
  2               Tbsp  Butter Or Margarine -- Softened
  1               cups  Milk -- Approx
                        Salt -- For Tops

These basic crispy crackers go well with soups, salads, dips, appetizers, and cheese. They will remind you of childhood rainy days and tomato soup.

Preheat the oven to 325F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour and salt. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Slowly mix in enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional Tablespoon of milk.

Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll the crackers paper thin. They will look almost translucent. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with salt and gently roll over the dough with your rolling pin.

With a sharp knife, carefully cut the crackers into 2" squares. handling them gently, transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 - 25 min, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.

Yield: 95 - 100

Variations:
This basic recipe can be the starting point for much interesting experimentation. Simply varying the flour or liquid can produce an entirely new cracker unavailable anywhere but in your kitchen.

  1 1/2            cup  milk
  2               tbsp  butter
                        -- (had unsalted in the frig.)

  4               cups  bread flour
  2                tsp  active dry yeast

I put them all in order of bread machine directions. My machine will do a loaf with 4 cups of flour (2 pound loaf). If your machine is smaller you will have to adjust.

NOTES : Dave asked for this recipe a few weeks ago.  Between him and I, we came up
with this recipe for the bread machine.

This turned out wonderful in my bread machine.  I have made several loaves now and thought I'd share.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  Whole-Wheat Bread Flour
  1 1/4           cups  Warm Water -- To 1 1/2 C
  1               Tbsp  Blackstrap Molasses
  1               Tbsp  Honey
     1/2          cups  Warm Water
     1/4           Tsp  Honey
  2                Tsp  Yeast

Mix the last three ingredients in a measuring cup, let sit for a couple minutes, then pour into the flour. Put the honey and molasses into the same cup, add 1 cup water, stir it to dissolve, then pour it into the flour.

Mix the dough, adding the remaining 1/4-1/2 cup of water as necessary to get all the flour into the dough. When the dough is ready to start kneading, put 3 cups of water in a large glass jar or bowl, and put in the microwave for 6-8 minutes on HIGH until it begins to boil. (The water, according to my microwave book, acts as a heat absorber and moderator. I never tried making bread without it, so it may or may not be necessary.) While the water is heating, kneed the dough. (I use an extra-large stainless steel mixing bowl to make bread, so I just kneed the dough in the same bowl I used to mix it. Makes clean up a snap.) Kneed for about 8 minutes, or until the water is boiling. **Very** lightly grease two 6-cup microwave bowls with vegetable oil. Cut the dough into two pieces, form these pieces into balls by turning the sides down and under, "twist" the bottom of the balls closed, and put the two balls into the two bowls, twist side down. Put the bowls of dough into your microwave along with the jar of boiled water and microwave on the low power setting (i.e., "1" or "10") for 20-25 minutes to let the dough rise. The dough will approximately double in size. Don't "punch it down" or kneed it a second time--just microwave on HIGH for 10 minutes to "bake" it. (I do this all at one time by programming my microwave to cook at "10" for 18 minutes, then "HIGH" for 10 minutes.) After "baking", remove the bread by simply turning the bowls upside down and shaking out the bread. You'll have two small round loaves when done.

                        Whole Wheat Pizza Crust #2

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pkg.  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  2               tsps  granulated sugar
     1/2           tsp  salt
  2              Tbsps  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

Go through the usual rigamarole of proofing the yeast, mixing it all (with the exception of 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, and kneading. Use the 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour for board and hands while kneading. Knead for about 5 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball and place in oiled bowl turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for about 15 minutes. Spray one 14-inch pizza pan with no-stick cooking spray (I like to use olive oil spray) and stretch crust to fit pan. If it resists, walk away and swear for a few minutes, and then stretch again. Form the edge to hold your choice of fillings. Top as desired. Bake in a pre-heated 425F oven until cheese is melted and crust is browned. It's pretty good stuff.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  lukewarm water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  lukewarm water
  2 3/4           cups  whole-wheat flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour -- for kneading
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

I'm not going to go through the motions of mixing, kneading, etc.

After kneading, let dough rise for 1 to 2 hours, covered with plastic wrap. Punch it down and work it into the desired shape and thickness (1/4 inch for crusty and 1/2 inch for softer. Flip it from time to time as you stretch it or roll it out. Cover and let rise an additional 20 minutes. Bake as directed in whatever recipe you are using.

This makes enough dough for a 12 inch thin-crust pizza or a 9 inch thick-crust pizza.

NOTES : Heavier and more flavorful than the standard dough, whole-wheat dough goes well with more robust pizza or calzone ingredients. Because of its increased fiber content, it will not, however, rise as high, producing a denser, chewier crust. If you want both flavor and lightness, use half whole-wheat flour and half all- purpose unbleached flour.
