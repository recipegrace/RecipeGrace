  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  2               cups  soy flour
  3               cups  unbleached white flour
  4        tablespoons  soy grits
  5        tablespoons  gluten, wheat
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  soy milk -- warmed slightly
                        cooking spray or oil

There's more waiting than work involved with this bread. Grits add a cracked wheat-like quality and the whole wheat is a nice addition, too. For a change of pace, next time shape dough into rolls or bread sticks, just decrease baking time a bit to allow for smaller shapes.

1. In a mixing bowl, stir together the flours, grits, gluten, yeast, sugar, and salt to distribute evenly.
2. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients, pour in soy milk, and stir together quickly to mix. Knead slightly with back of spoon, just enough to combine well and to moisten all of the dry ingredients. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then a towel, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour. Stir down, cover again, and let rise again, until double. This may take another hour or more, depending on temperature in your kitchen. Don't rush it. This one is a slow riser, but worth it.
3. Spray or oil baking sheets or line with parchment. After second rise, divide dough into halves, then quarters. Shape each quarter into either a long, slender baguette, 4 large rolls, or 8 thin sticks. Place on prepared sheets, brush tops with a pastry brush dipped in warm water, and slash top, if desired. Cover with a towel and set in a warm place to rise for about an hour.
4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, watching carefully to prevent over browning. Remove to a rack to cool.

Makes 16 servings: 4 baguettes, 16 rolls, or 32 breadsticks . PER SERVING: 211 CAL (16% from fat), 13 g PROT, 3.7g FAT, 31 CARB, 148mg sodium, 0mg CHOL, 4g Fiber.

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            cup  Water -- plus
  1               Tbsp  water
  1 1/2            cup  Bread flour -- white
  1 1/2            cup  Bread flour -- whole wheat
  1 1/2       teaspoon  Salt
  2         tablespoon  Honey
  2         tablespoon  Molasses
  1         tablespoon  Gluten, wheat
  2         tablespoon  Olive oil
     2/3           cup  Seeds:
                        pumpkin/flax/sesame/Sunflower
                        -- or your favorite
  2           teaspoon  Yeast -- fast rise
                        -- or 3 tsp Yeast -- active dry

Add ingredients in order for your Abm. Enjoy this crunchy, chewy texture, you won't even need a toaster for crispness. High in fiber and high in taste,100% Crunch brings a new dimension to an avocado and sprout sandwich.

You may use 3 c WW bread flour if desired. Success Hints: We used equal amounts of pumpkin, flax and sunflower seeds. Try using different seeds for different taste and texture. (No bird seed, please!) For best results, use the "extra knead" process and add seeds near the end of the first knead. Gluten is available in health food stores and nutritional departments. This recipe can be made with the regular, rapid, or time bake cycles.

For a regular loaf: 3/4 c +1 tb water, 1 c Whole wheat bread flour, 1 c White bread flour, or 2 c WW bread flour, 1 ts Salt, 4 ts Honey, 4 ts Molasses, 2ts Gluten, 4 ts Olive oil, 1/2 c Seeds, 1 ts fast rise Yeast or 2 ts active dry Yeast.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  yeast -- scant
  3               cups  Pillsbury whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  gluten, wheat
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                tsp  salt
     1/2           cup  instant potato flakes
  4        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                cup  warm water -- (1 to 1/4)

My favorite bread recipe is a 100% whole wheat bread made with Pillsbury's Graham whole wheat flour.

Normally, I like King Arthur unbleached flour instead of "bread" flour as I avoid the many additives in other brands. something about Pillsbury WW, though, which is a single ingredient flour, makes a better WW bread. I always use bulk Red Star yeast from the health food store.

             Adjusting Dough Consistency In The Bread Machine

                  ****

Adjusting Dough Consistency: Bread machine dough is slightly stickier than hand-kneaded dough. After mixing for a few minutes, the ingredients should turn into a dough that forms a soft, smooth ball around the blade. If your machine seems to be straining or if the dough appears too dry or stiff, add more liquid in 1-teaspoon increments to achieve the proper consistency. If the dough seems too soft or slack, add additional bread flour in 1-teaspoon increments until the proper consistency is reached. Do not add more than 3 to 4 tablespoons of liquid or flour. The machine cannot compensate for wide variations from the norm and may not bake the larger amount of dough thoroughly.

                        -- 1 Lb Loaf: -- (1 1/2 Lb Loaf):
  1 1/2            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- (2 1/4 Tsp)
  1 3/4            cup  Bread Flour -- (2 2/3 C)
     1/3           cup  Rolled Oats -- (1/2 C)
     1/2           Tsp  Salt -- (3/4 Tsp)
  2               Tbsp  Poppy Seeds -- (3 T)
  1                Tsp  Almond Extract -- (1 1/2 Tsp)
  2               Tbsp  Sugar -- (3 T)
  1               Tbsp  Wonderslim -- *Note, (1 1/2 T)
     1/2           cup  Skim Milk -- **Note, (1 C)
     1/4           cup  Egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute -- ***Note, (1/2 C)
     1/4           cup  Slivered Almonds -- (6 T)

*NOTE: Original recipe used 2 T butter for small loaf and 3 T for large.
**NOTE:  Original recipe used regular milk
***NOTE:  Original recipe used 1 regular egg for both small and large.

This is a light, barely sweet bread, with oatmeal adding texture. It is a good bread for breakfast or a snack, and not at all like those gummy, overly sweet muffins.

Put all ingredients except almonds in bread pan in order suggested by your bread machine instructions. Set for white bread, medium crust. Press Start. Adding almonds at the beeper or after the first kneading.
This is a wonderful tasting loaf of bread...and it sure disappears quickly!!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  skim milk
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
     1/4           cup  Egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
     1/2           cup  bananas -- mashed
     1/3           cup  semisweet chocolate chips

In a large mixing bowl thoroughly mix 1 cup of flour, salt, and yeast. Combine skim milk and butter or margarine in a saucepan. Heat over low heat until liquids are warm (110 to 120 degrees F. Butter or margarine does not need to melt. Gradually add to dry ingredients and mix. Add egg beaters, mashed bananas, chocolate pieces, and 1 cup of flour. Mix thoroughly. Add enough flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 8 minutes.

Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down. Cover and let rise again, about 45 minutes. Shape into loaf and place in greased 8" x 4" loaf pan. Cover and let rise in warm place until dough fills pan and top of loaf is about 1" above top of pan edge, about 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Uncover dough. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when lightly tapped. Immediately remove from pan; cool on wire rack.

If I make it again I will increase the banana since the chocolate overwhelmed it.

until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down; turn out on lightly floured board and shape as desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
                        -- preferably SAF Instant -- not rapid-rise
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  3         tablespoon  nonfat dry milk
  3                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
  2           teaspoon  chili powder
  1                cup  canned vegetarian refried beans
     1/4           cup  chile-infused olive oil -- or vegetable oil
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  honey
     2/3           cup  water -- (approximately)

Put all dough ingredients in machine and program for dough or manual. Start machine.
This is a moist dough, but should form a ball; if it doesn't, add up to 1/3 cup more water a little at a time. At end of last cycle, deflate dough, remove from machine and let rest on lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. (If you want to make a loaf from this dough, either allow it to finish the rising and baking cycles in the machine or shape the dough into a loaf, fit into a pan, and place in conventional oven preheated to 375F. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer plunged into its center reads 200F.)

See "Quitza" recipe for a topping suggestion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- ONE POUND LOAF:
  2 1/4           cups  whole wheat flour
     1/4           cup  gluten, wheat
  1                cup  Cheshire cheese or sharp cheddar -- shredded
  1         Tablespoon  dry milk
  1         Tablespoon  date sugar
  1         Tablespoon  Bouquet garni
  1                Cup  beer -- flat, at room temp
  1         tablespoon  Olive oil
  1            package  active dry yeast

Carefully measure the dry ingredients and transfer to the bread pan. Add the liquid ingredients and yeast.
Program the breadmaker for the whole wheat mode. At the end of the baking cycle, remove the bread promptly from the machine, taking care, as the oven surface will be very hot. Invert the bread pan onto a wire rack and shake several times to dislodge the bread. Allow to cool completely on the rack before slicing or wrapping for storage.

NOTES : Try to find English Cheshire cheese in a cheese shop or in your market, as it will impart the perfect flavor to this light and crusty bread. If Cheshire is not available, a good sharp cheddar will be an acceptable substitute.

I used a good white cheddar cheese. This makes wonderful sandwiches.

     1/2           cup  milk -- scalded

Dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside to proof. Mix scalded milk and boiling water in large bowl. Add honey and let stand until lukewarm. Stir in yeast and whole wheat flour. Cover with damp cloth and let stand in warm draft-free area until doubled. Stir sponge down. Combine all purpose flour, bran, salt and soda and blend into sponge. Turn out onto floured surface and knead well (dough should be workable but sticky). Return dough to bowl and let rise again 25-30 minutes.
Grease 12 muffin rings (3 to 3 1/2-inch round). Punch dough down and roll or pat out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into circles and transfer with rings to flat surface, cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Dust both sides with cornmeal. Toast on both sides on ungreased griddle until browned, about 6-8 minutes per side, removing ring after first side is browned. Let muffins cool on rack. Separate into halves with fork. Wrap well and refrigerate. Toast under broiler or in toaster oven just before serving.

  1 1/2           cups  evaporated skim milk
                        -- (comes in 12 oz can)
  2        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine

     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
                 pinch  ground nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  2        tablespoons  bourbon
                        -- (or any good liquor)
     1/2           cup  raisins
  1                     apple -- diced  small




* I use sourdough toasted @ 200 degrees for 30 mins or so. Yes, 8 ozs is not much!

In a large bowl, combine the sugars, and Sweet and Low. Place the milks, margarine, cream cheese, Butter Buds, and half the sugars into a large sauce pan over med heat and bring to a boil while whisking (watch it or it will scorch easily). Add eggs, spices, bourbon, and vanilla to the remaining sugar, and whisk til well mixed.

When the milk has boiled, remove from heat and immediately drizzle into the egg mixture while whisking all. When this mixture is well incorporated, add the raisins, apple, and bread, and let it sit for 30/60 mins while it soaks up some of the liquid.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees, and "butter" a 9 inch baking pan. Pour pudding into the pan, and bake in center of top shelf for 45 mins, or until top is browned and middle tests "set" (knife inserted into center comes out clean).

This pudding will appear "soupy" prior to baking, and you will be tempted to add more bread. Try it this way first, and I think you will avoid making a dry pudding. Serve with a no-fat topping.

Makes 6 servings

NOTES : As a weekend, recreational bread baker, I'm always looking for good ways to use up excess, maybe even stale, bread. The birds can only eat so much! I'm also on a continual quest for low fat, low sugar foods that taste good. This is my best adaptation yet of a rich New Orleans bread pudding, with thanks to Ruth Fertel of Ruth's Chris' fame, and her grandmother, for the original.

  3                     eggs -- beaten
                        -- reserve 1 egg yolk for glaze
     1/4           cup  poppy seeds -- optional

Yield:  1 large braided loaf

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine first four ingredients into large mixing bowl. Add yeast and combine thoroughly.
Add remaining ingredients; mix only until dough starts to form a ball -- approximately 10-20 seconds.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. Repeat.

Divide dough into three equal-sized pieces. Shape pieces into ropes, about 20-24" long. Braid pieces together to form a loaf. You may connect the ends of the braid to form a circular loaf or leave the braid straight. If you make the circular loaf, make sure the ends of the braid are firmly pressed together (use a few drops of water to "cement" the pieces). Place on lightly greased (I use cooking spray) cooking sheets. Place in warm, draft-free location for the final rise. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap until loaf is doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 500F while dough is rising.

When the braid has doubled in size, combine the reserved egg yolk with 1 Tbsp. of water. Mix well; then brush the top of the braid with the glaze. Sprinkle poppy seeds on top, if desired.

Turn heat down to 375 (or 350 if using convection); immediately uncover braid and place into oven for 35-45 minutes, until crust has turned a nice golden brown. Remove braid to racks to cool thoroughly.

Allow braid to cool for at least 60 minutes before slicing. If freezing for later use, cool thoroughly (about 2 hours).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Large Loaf:
     3/4           cup  water
  3                cup  white bread flour
  1 1/4            tsp  salt
     3/4           cup  dried cherries
     1/2           cup  cherry yogurt
     1/4           cup  applesauce
  1               Tbsp  brown sugar
                        yeast -- fast rise
                        -- OR   2 tsp yeast - active dry

This makes a wonderful loaf of bread. It is moist and light, and would be good for French toast.

You can't use the time-bake setting, but regular and rapid bake cycles are fine. My bread machine is a Panasonic, and the yeast amounts are fine. I have only used the regular active dry yeast, but I do choose the kind for bread machines.

  1              ounce  firm tofu
                        -- (1 1/4-inch slice from a 3-1/2 x 1-1/2-
                        -- inch loaf, or abut 2 tablespoons)
  1         tablespoon  soy margarine
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1                cup  powdered sugar -- or more as needed

Use this to drizzle on coffee cakes or muffins...or slather on Black and White Brownies If goodies are still warm, it melts into a thin, rich glaze.

In a mixing bowl, use a fork to mash tofu with margarine and vanilla, until relatively smooth. Stirring briskly, add cinnamon and half the powdered sugar and mix well. Add remaining sugar and whisk to a smooth, spreadable consistency, adding more pow- dered sugar, if necessary.

Makes about 1/2 cup; enough frosting for 16 rolls or 32 brownies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached white flour
  1                cup  soy flour
  2        tablespoons  gluten, wheat
  4          teaspoons  active dry yeast -- (or 2 packages)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  firm tofu
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  raisins
                        cinnamon
                        cooking spray or oil
                        cinnamon soy frosting -- (optional)

Soy flour replaces the usual butter and eggs. Dense, sweet, moist, and rich--this old favorite loses nothing in the translation. Although you can also go through a traditional rising procedure), with the overnight rising method, they'll be ready in time for a special breakfast.

1. In a large mixing bowl, stir together flours, gluten, yeast, sugar, and salt to distribute evenly.

2. In a small bowl, mash tofu with a fork and whisk together with water--a few small lumps are okay. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients, pour in tofu mixture, and stir together quickly to mix. Knead slightly with back of spoon, just to combine ingredients well and moisten all of the flour. Transfer to a plastic container with ample space for rising and a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate overnight.

3. Next morning, lightly spray or oil a baking sheet. On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough into a 10-1/2-inch square. Sprinkle with half of the brown sugar and raisins, leaving a margin of 1/2 inch at the far edge; then sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. Starting with the near edge, roll up tightly, then pinch along the far edge to secure the roll. Repeat with second half of dough and filling. With seam side down, slice each roll into 8 equal pieces and place, spiral side up, on pre- pared sheet. (If you prefer single rolls, place about 3 inches apart; for pull-apart bunches, place about 1/2 inch apart.) Cover with a cloth and set aside to rise in a warm place, about 40 minutes.

4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake about 20 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to a rack to cool a bit before frosting, if desired.

     1/2           Cup  water
     1/3           Cup  butter or margarine -- cut into pieces
  2                     eggs
  3        Tablespoons  butter or margarine -- melted

  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        Crumb Topping -- recipe follows

In large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, undissolved yeast,and salt. Heat milk, water, and 1/3 cup butter until very warm (120° to 130°F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in eggs and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.  To fill and shape loaves: Divide dough in half. Roll each half to 16-x7-inch rectangle. Brush each rectangle with 3 tablespoons melted butter to within 1 inch of edges. Combine 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and raisins; sprinkle evenly over dough. Beginning at short end of each rectangle, roll up tightly as for jelly roll; pinch seams and ends to seal. Place, seam sides down, in 2 greased 9- x 5-inch loaf pans.Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 to 45 minutes. Brush loaves with egg white; sprinkle with Crumb Topping. Bake at 375°F for 40 to 45 minutes or until done. Remove from pans; let cool on wire racks.

Crumb Topping: In small bowl, combine 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon. Cut in 3 tablespoons cold butter or margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  3               Cups  Flour
  1                Cup  Water
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  2        Tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  Yeast
                        Filling:
  1                Jar  pizza sauce -- or Ragu
     1/3           Cup  Chopped Onions
     1/3           Cup  Green Peppers -- Chopped
  1                Cup  Italian Sausage -- ( to 2 cups)
                        -- or Pepperoni or Mexican Cherozo
  2               Cups  fresh tomatoes -- chopped
                        -- (plum tomatoes are best)
                        Sprinkle Red Pepper flakes
                        Mushrooms -- if you like them
  500            Grams  cheese -- sliced, or 1 pound

This is easy to make takes a bit of time but little work, its worth it. Its totally different from anything I have ever purchased. You need a big deep dish pizza pan or if don't have one I have made it on a cookie sheet. (the kind with the sides) All the toppings are optional but I strongly suggest the tomatoes. They give it a real flavor boost.

Make the dough in the ABM on the dough cycle. Grease the pan, chop the veggies and slice and If you are using the Italian or Mexican sausage cook it slightly to remove the grease. (If you have never had Mexican Sausage "Cherizo" I suggest you get some for the pizza its great. It has a distinctive flavor that goes well in a pizza) Just remove the casing and either crumble it or slice it and lightly brown it.

When the dough is ready put it into the pan and press down with finger tips. Pour a wee bit of olive Oil on the dough so it will not stick to your fingers. Then press it out to the corners of the pan. If it keeps returning to the center let it rest for 5 minutes and try again.

When you have the dough spread out pour the entire jar of sauce ( I know it says to use 1/2) on the dough, sprinkle with pepper flakes (if desired) then sprinkle with all the other ingredients, add the cheese last. Cover with a large sheet of Aluminum foil and let raise for 45 minutes.

Pop into a 350 oven for 20 minutes to half hour or until the cheese starts to brown in spots.

Note use real cheese. When ever I make a pizza I get rid of almost all the cheese I have in the fridge its a great way to get rid of the little odds and ends you have laying around. You need the Mozzarella for a base but a little bit of cheddar or Swiss adds a bit more flavor to the cheese. The only thing I have found I don't like is the Imitation cheeses.

  5 1/2            cup  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- To 6 C, *
  2               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast -- *
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  2                Tsp  Salt
     1/4           Tsp  Baking Soda
  2                cup  Milk
     1/2           cup  Water
                        Cornmeal -- *

This is a yeasty, coarse-textured bread.  It makes great toast and a
perfect partner to fresh summer jam or preserves.  This is a purely
mix-it-slap-in- the-pan-bake-and-eat-it loaf.  It's a particularly nice
loaf in the summer, when you might not feel like spending a lot of time in
the kitchen.

* indicates items that can be purchased from King Arthur Flour Co.

Combine 3 C of the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and soda.  Heat the milk and
water until very warm, 120 deg F.  Pour liquids into dry mixture, and beat
well.  Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough.

Grease two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2" bread pans*, and sprinkle them with cornmeal.
Spoon the dough into the pans.  Sprinkle additional cornmeal on top of the
loaves.  Cover and let rise in a warm place for 45 min.

Bake at 400 deg F for 25 min.  Remove loaves from pans and cool on a wire
rack.

Makes 2 loaves.

When fresh bread has cooled completely, slice into two-day chunks, put each chunk into a Ziplock baggie, and freeze.

To warm a frozen chunk, leave it in the sealed baggie, and either stand it on edge on the counter (or better, on a rack) for an hour or two, or microwave on very low power for a very short time (your microwave may vary from my weak one -- I use half power for maybe 20 seconds) until the bread is slightly warm on the outside though still frozen inside. Now let it sit out, still in the baggie, for five or 10 minutes until it is completely thawed and any condensation inside the baggie has been absorbed.

The crust will be soft but the bread should otherwise be like-new fresh. I do this all the time; the bread keeps in the freezer for weeks.

NOTES : I bought one of these clay bakers a while back, too. I've made about 10 loaves in it, and though they have all come out with a wonderful top crust, I cannot get the bottom crust to brown IN the pot. I have to remove the 'finished' loaf, and place it on my pizza stone to brown it. The inside texture is great, and the top crust is perfect. But the bottom never seems to brown. What am I doing wrong?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     7/8           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
  2          teaspoons  yeast

Place everything in pot in order presented. Press "start." When second knead cycle has completed, turn off machine and allow dough to rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and allow to double in bulk a second time.
Punch dough down and remove from pot. Form into a ball and allow to rest 5 min.

While dough is rising in bread machine machine, soak the Terra Cotta baking dish in water for about 30 min. Just before using, grease the bottom half of the dish and dust with cornmeal.

After the 5 min. rest period, form dough into a 15 inch long loaf and carefully lift into the dish. Place dish in a warm (about 85 deg.) spot and allow dough to double in bulk for the third time.

When ready to bake, cover the dish with the soaked lid and place in a COLD oven. Turn on the oven, set the temperature control to 400 deg. F and allow to bake 30 min. with the lid on. After the 30 min. remove the lid, reduce the temp to 375 deg. F and bake another 15-20 min. or until the desired color is reached. During the final baking period, turn the dish periodically to ensure even browning. When done, remove immediately to wire rack for cooling.

Bon Appetito

NOTES : You are indeed lucky to have received a clay baker as a gift.  I have one and it does a marvellous job.  It bakes a loaf of French bread that has a thin, crackly, very crisp crust.

Assuming your clay baker is about the same dimensions as mine, 15x6x8 inches,
you should be aware that It is not large enough to handle a 1 1/2 pound loaf.
When the loaf expands in the oven it will get up into the lid, stick, and
create an enormous mess.  The recipe I use is for a 1 pound loaf and it works
perfectly.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- (4 3/4 to 5 1/4)
     1/3           cup  wheat germ

  2           packages  active dry yeast -- Rapid Rise
                        -- Fleischmann's RapidRise Yeast
  2          teaspoons  Fines Herbes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     3/4           cup  water

In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, wheat germ, sugar, undissolved yeast, fines herbes, salt, and onion powder. Heat 3/4 cup water, milk, and butter until very warm (120F to 130F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in 1 egg and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Divide dough into 18 equal pieces. Divide each again into 3 equal pieces; roll into smooth balls. Place 3 balls in each section of 18 greased 2 1/2-inch muffin pan cups. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Beat remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water; brush on rolls. Bake at 400F for 12 to 15 minutes or until done. Remove from cups; let cool on wire racks.
*Or use 1/2 teaspoon each: Thyme (leaves), Oregano (leaves), Sweet Basil, and Marjoram.

NOTES : I've made it several times, always shaping the rolls as buns instead of cloverleafs. Recently I made them at someone's rental condo which had limited bottled herbs and used the bottle of Italian Seasoning for the Fines Herbes. I like the little bit of added fiber in these rolls.

  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  lukewarm water
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat or brown rice flour
  1              bunch  scallions
  1         tablespoon  rosemary -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  thyme -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sage -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  unbleached flour
                        cooking spray

(Original recipe used 2 tablespoons olive oil.)
1.  In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water and let stand until it
bubbles, about 10 minutes.  Slowly stir in whole wheat flour, scallions,
rosemary, thyme, and sage.  Mix well, cover, and set aside to rise in a
warm place for about 45 minutes.
2.  Stir in olive oil, salt, and 1 1/2 cups white flour to form a stiff
dough.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes,
adding more flour as necessary to keep from sticking.  Shape into a ball,
place in a large, lightly-sprayed bowl, and turn oiled side up.  Cover with
plastic wrap and set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3.  Preheat grill to medium-hot.  Divide dough into six balls.  On a
lightly floured surface, roll balls into 7-inch circles (about 1/4 inch
thick.)  Gently place breads on grill and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side,
turning occasionally, until well marked and browned.

Makes 6 breads.

NOTES : We had lots of fun making this easy bread while we were camping last weekend. Before we left home I premeasured the whole wheat flour together with the herbs and brought them in a ziplock bag. We grilled the bread over a charcoal fire as an accompaniment for dinner and then the next day opened them up as pocket bread so that we could put a sandwich filling inside. The bread is very flavorful. I decreased the oil in this bread as I do for most breads.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Starter:
     1/2           cup  rye flour
     1/8           tsp  salt
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  caraway seed -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  minced onion
                        ---
                        Stage one (large mixing bowl!):
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/4            cup  rye flour
                        All the starter
                        ---
                        Stage two: add the following to Stage one:
     1/2           cup  warm water
     3/4           cup  rye flour
                        ---
                        Stage three: add the following to Stage
                        two:
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1                cup  rye flour
                        ---
                        Altus:
                        leftover rye bread -- soaked in water

                        Bread at last: -- *
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/2            cup  rye sour -- (Stage three)
     1/4           cup  altus

                        -- (soak first in the water if you prefer)
  1                tsp  yeast

* (There's enough Stage three for two loaves; I refrigerate
half for the next day, because I make it in the bread machine.)

It's convenient to make Starter one day, Stages one and two the next day, refrigerate, then Stage three and the bread the next day. Note that this bread contains no shortening or sugar.

Starter:
Mix; cover; leave in oven with light on until bubbly (up to 24 hours).

Stage one (large mixing bowl!):
Mix; sprinkle another 1/4 C rye flour over the top; let stand in oven until
double, with deep cracks on top (4 - 8 hours).

Stage two: add the following to Stage one:
Mix; sprinkle another 1/4 C rye four over top; cover; proceed as before.
It can be refrigerated at any stage.

Stage three: add the following to Stage two:
Mix and proceed as before.
Set aside 1/4 - 1/2 C  as starter ; cover with film of water; cover
container; refrigerate.

Altus:
Soak some leftover rye bread in water a few hours or overnight in fridge.
squeeze dry and crumble.  This will keep covered in fridge.

NOTES : This is a fabulous sourdough rye recipe (no molasses, chocolate, coffee, or fat).
This is real bread!  It's flavorful and chewy.  None of this balloon bread
stuff.  I can send you the recipe if you like, but the book is great, and
loaded with wonderful tips.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 Pound Loaf: -- (1 1/2 Lb Loaf):
     1/3           cup  Rolled Oats -- (1/2 C)
     1/4           cup  Boiling Water -- (6 Tbsp)
  2                Tsp  Yeast -- (1 Tbsp)

     1/2           Tsp  Salt -- (3/4 Tsp)
  2                Tsp  Sugar -- (1 Tbsp)
  1         tablespoon  Icbinb-Light -- *Note, (1 1/2 Tbsp)
     1/2           cup  Pureed Mango -- (3/4 C)
     1/4           cup  Skim Milk -- **Note, (6 Tbsp)
     1/4           cup  Chopped Macadamia Nuts -- ***Note, (6 Tbsp)

With its tropical flavor, this bread goes well with a fruited chicken salad
sandwich.

*NOTE:  Original recipe used butter
**NOTE:  Original recipe used regular milk
***NOTE:  I didn't have any macadamia nuts so I used toasted hazelnuts

Put the oats in bread machine pan and pour the boiling water over them.
Stir so all the oats are wet.  Let sit at least 15 min.  Add all the
remaining ingredients except the nuts.  Set for white bread, medium crust.
Press Start.  Check the dough after about 10 min.  Depending on the water
content of the mango, the dough may need a little more milk or flour.   Add
the nuts after the first kneading or when the machine signals to add fruit
or nuts.

This was very good!!

Categories    : Bread-Bakers Mailing List       Breads
                Hand Made                       Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         Tablespoon  active dry yeast -- dissolved in:
     1/4           Cup  tepid water
  2        Tablespoons  instant mashed potatoes -- softened in:
     1/2           Cup  boiling water
                        -- or 1/4 cup grated raw potato -- simmered until
                        tender in:
                        -- 1 cup water
     1/2           Cup  cold water
                        -- or cold milk if using raw potato
  2 1/2           Cups  all-purpose flour
                        To be added after first rise:
  1 1/2            Tsp  salt -- dissolved in:
  3        Tablespoons  tepid water
  2        Tablespoons  butter -- softened (2 to 3)

Heavy griddle or large frying pan, or non-stick electric skillet

muffin or crumpet rings or cat-food or tunafish cans about 3 inches in
diameter with tops and bottoms removed

4 to 5 T ladle or long handled cup

The Dough
While yeast is dissolving, assemble the other ingredients. Then into the instant potatoes beat the cold milk, and stir it along with the water and dissolved yeast into the flour. (Or if using raw potato, stir the cold milk into the potato pan, then stir both in to the flour, adding dissolved yeast only after mixture has cooled to tepid.) Beat vigorously for a minute or so with a wooden spoon to make a smooth loose thick batter, heavier than the usual pancake batter but not at all like the conventional dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise, preferably at around 80F until batter has risen and large bubbles have appeared in the surface (usually about 1 1/2 hours - it must be bubbly, however long it takes).
Stir the batter down, then beat in the salt and water, beating vigorously for a minute. Cover and let rise until bubbles again appear in the surface, about an hour at 80F. The batter is now ready to become English Muffins. (Batter may sit for an hour or more after its second rise, or you may use one of the delaying tactics suggested at the end of recipe).

Preliminaries
When you are ready to cook the muffins, brush insides of rings fairly generously with butter; butter surface of griddle and set over moderate heat . When just hot enough, so that drops of water begin to dance on it, the heat is about right. Scoop your ladle into the batter and dislodge the batter into a ring with rubber spatula; batter should be about 3/8" thick to make a raised muffin twice that. Batter should be heavy, sticky, sluggish, but not runny having just enough looseness to be spread out into the ring. If you think it is too thick, beat in tepid water by driblets.

Cooking the muffins
The muffins are to cook slowly on one side until bubbles, which form near the bottom of the muffin, pierce through the top surface, and until almost the entire top changes from a wet ivory to a dryish gray colour; this will take 6 to 8 minutes or more, depending on the heat. Regulate heat so that bottoms of muffins do not colour more than a medium or pale brown. Now the muffins are to be turned over for a brief cooking on the other side. Less than a minute is usually enough for cooking the second side. Cool muffins on rack.

Delaying tactics
Not much can happen to ruin this dough, as long as you have achieved the necessary bubbles. You may let it wait at room temp for an hour or more before baking; or you may even refrigerate it over night. If it seems to have lost its bubble, you can bring it back to life by beating in another cup of flour blended with enough tepid water to make a batter; this will give the yeast something more to feed on and in an hour or so it will rise and bubble again as it gobbles its new food. You can even turn this batter into a sourdough. Simply let it sit at room temp for a day or two until it has soured, then bottle and refrigerate it. You can now use it in any sourdough recipe, or you can make sourdough English muffins; blend 1/2 cup of it with 1 cup flour and enough water to make a batter, add 1 T dissolved yeast, and let it rise; then beat in more flour and water, or milk, and add salt; let it rise and bubble again; and cook your muffins. Replenish the sourdough starter by mixing it with more flour and water or milk blended into a batter, and let sit at room temp until it has bubbled up and subsided; refrigerate as before.

NOTES : I just had to post this recipe since I was so impressed. I usually eat most of a fresh loaf of bread while it is still warm and toast a couple of pieces the next day and after that it gets thrown in the fridge to die a slow death :-) BUT this bread is still as fresh and moist and chewy as they day I made it, which was two days ago now. I am truly amazed. I don't think it will be seeing the fridge at all! I hope you try it and like it as much as I did. I found the recipe written with the skim milk and I changed it and used the buttermilk powder and water. I used regular oats not quick - don't know if it would make a difference.

  2                cup  Bread Flour
  3               Tbsp  Packed Brown Sugar
     1/3           cup  Chunky Peanut Butter
  1                cup  Water

This is a really nice snack bread, but it's also terrific to send in lunch boxes for a new twist on the standard peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Add all the ingredients to the machine in the order listed. Choose either regular or light crust (depending on your preference) and push "Start".

Tip: To measure and add the peanut butter put some nonstick cooking spray or oil in the measuring cup first. The peanut butter will then measure easily and slide right out.

This recipe is dairy-free

This recipe will work on a "rapid" or "quick bread" setting.

This bread may be prepared on the timer, if you use the timer method, though, use active dry yeast (rather than compressed) and if you have a yeast dispenser, use it.

This is very tasty!!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 Lb Loaf: -- (1 1/2 Lb Loaf):
  1 1/2            Tsp  Yeast -- (2 1/4 Tsp)
  2                cup  Bread Flour -- (3 C)
     1/2           Tsp  Nutmeg -- (3/4 Tsp)
     1/2           Tsp  Ground Ginger -- (3/4 Tsp)
     1/2           Tsp  Salt -- (3/4 Tsp)
  2               Tbsp  Butter -- (3 T)
  2                Tsp  Honey -- (1 T)
  3               Tbsp  Pear Liquid -- Or Water, (4-5T)
     1/2           cup  Pear Puree -- (3/4 C)

This is based on a bread made in the French countryside amid pear orchards.
It has a delicate, sweet flavor of pears. It is a nice tea or breakfast bread, or can be used in mildly flavored sandwiches such as cream cheese and cucumber.

Make the pear puree by peeling and coring 3 pears for the smaller recipe, 4 or 5 for the larger one. Cut each pear in several pieces and put in a small saucepan with 1 or 2 T water. Start cooking over very low heat. The pears will quickly start releasing their own juices, and nor more water will be needed. Increase to medium heat. Cook the pears until they are very soft, about 10 min. Then drain off as much liquid as you can, saving the liquid. Put the pears in a blend3er or food processor and puree.

Measure out the required amount of puree. Put it and all other ingredients except pear liquid in bread pan in order suggested by your bread machine instructions. The amount of liquid needed for the bread will depend on the liquid in the puree, so you'll need to watch the dough for the first few minutes, adding pear liquid (or plain water) until it reaches the proper consistency - neither stiff nor too soft. Set for white bread, medium crust. Press Start. Once you have added the liquid, the bread does not need any further attention until it is baked.

This was really good!! We enjoyed the very subtle flavor of the pears.

                Hand Made                       White Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  13                oz  baking potatoes
  3        Tablespoons  brown sugar -- firmly packed
  1         Tablespoon  yeast
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour -- or as needed
  3        Tablespoons  butter -- melted and cooled
  2          teaspoons  salt


Scrub potatoes, slice and boil in water to cover until soft. Place the potatoes and cooking water in blender container and add water to bring measure to 3 cups; puree and transfer to large bowl. Stir in brown sugar and cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over, stir to dissolve and let rest at room temperature 45 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the flour and beat vigorously about 3 minutes until air bubbles form. Stir in butter and salt, beat well and gradually add 1 - 1/2 cups of the remaining flour. Let rest at room temperature 45 minutes. Mound remaining flour on board, turn dough out and, using a steel baker's scraper, knead in the flour until dough is stiff enough to knead by hand. Adding additional flour as needed to prevent sticking, knead 3 to 5 minutes. Dough will be soft and slightly sticky. Divide into 2 equal portions, knead briefly, form into 2 loaves and place in 2 oiled loaf pans. Cover with tea towel and let rise in a warm place 45 minutes or until almost double in size. Place in oven, turn heat to 350 degrees F and bake 45 minutes or until bread tests done. Turn out onto wire rack, turn right side up and cool.

NOTES : Makes two medium loaves.

This recipe, I believe is one of the best I have ever made. Here's one that will make your mouth water. This is home made bread at it's best. Do make this one, you will not be disappointed.

The only ingredient I changed was the butter, I used diet margarine.
I also used my KitchenAid mixer to do all the kneading.

                Miscellaneous & Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bean Bread (from Baking with Julia) -- see recipe
                        Topping:
  12                oz  cream cheese -- at room temp
  2                cup  chunky salsa
                        -- (homemade or store bought)
  1                cup  shredded cheddar cheese
                        -- or Monterey jack cheese

Quitza:

The quitza can be made in a 12 1/2-inch sloped sided springform pan or a traditional 12-inch springform. Lightly spray pan with vegetable oil spray. (You can also make this as a flat pizza, in which case it should be baked on a preheated baking or pizza stone.)

Working on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 16-inch circle. Fit the dough into the pan, stretching and pressing it so that it covers the bottom of the pan and comes up the sides.

Topping:
Carefully spread softened cream cheese over bottom of dough. Check the salsa, if it's water, spoon it into a strainer and shake out the excess liquid. Spoon the salsa over the cream cheese and top it with shredded cheese. Let quitza rise, uncovered, at room temp for about 30 minutes, or until dough is puffy and doubled in bulk. While dough is rising, center a rack in the oven and preheat oven to 475F.
Bake the quitza for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crust is deep brown and the cheese is bubbling. Serve hot or at room temperature. The quitza is best served the day it is made.

The quitza is very good. I have not found that I've had to add extra water when I've made the dough. I check on it when it's kneading and it's always formed a ball. If you can find the cookbook at a discounted price, or borrow from the library, it's very good. Lots of bread recipes, mostly for hand or Kitchen Aid mixing. The series is pretty good too (no, I'm not getting a commission from Julia...) It's just that they always make it look soooo easy on television. (p.s. sorry this post is so long)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        PRIMARY BATTER:
  1                cup  sourdough starter
  1                cup  water -- 85 deg. F
  1 1/2           cups  flour
                        DOUGH:
  1 1/2           cups  primary batter
     1/4           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

PRIMARY BATTER
Combine the starter, water and flour in a bowl large enough to allow for some expansion of the batter. Mix well with a whisk, cover with Saran Wrap and allow to stand 12 - 24 hours until the batter has completely fermented. The longer the proofing period the more sour the final product will be. After this proofing period, remove 1 cup of the batter and return it to your jar of sourdough starter. Put the starter jar back in the fridge.

Dough
Place the remainder of the primary batter - about 1 1/2 cups - and all other ingredients in the ABM in the order presented and press start. After final kneading turn off machine and allow dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. Punch down and allow to double in bulk a second time - about another 2 hours.

FOR A LOAF
When second proofing is done, remove the dough from the ABM, form into a loaf, place into a greased 9x5 inch bread pan and allow to double in bulk.
Bake at 375 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes.

FOR BAGUETTES
When second proofing is done, remove the dough from the ABM and divide it in half. Form into two 15 inch loaves and place in baguette pans or on a cookie sheet, whichever is your preference. Allow loaves to double in bulk. Slash diagonally several times and bake at 400 degrees for about 18 to 20 minutes.


For a crisper crust, just before placing the baguettes in the oven spray them with cold water. Then spray them every three minutes for nine minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  sourdough starter
  5 1/2           cups  flour
  3        tablespoons  gluten, wheat
  3        tablespoons  dried buttermilk -- powder
  2 1/2    tablespoons  active dry yeast -- instant
     3/4           cup  unsweetened applesauce
                        hot water

Been experimenting with sourdough and have a really nice low fat bread that
I like.

Use 2 1/2 cups of proofed sourdough batter, whatever you like the best.

Add 5 1/2 cups of flour, 3 tbsp. gluten, 3 tbsp. powdered buttermilk
powder, 2 1/2 tbsp. instant yeast, 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, and
enough hot water (I use the hottest available off the tap) to bring it
together.  Let it set for 20 minutes after it is just come together for
kneading.

After 20 minutes knead for 3 to 5 minutes, let rise to double, and then
split between two loaves.  Brush with hot water before putting in 350 oven
for 30 to 35 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  starter
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3         tablespoon  instant potatoes
  1                cup  warm water
                        -----
  6                cup  f1our
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                cup  Day 1 starter
     1/2           cup  corn oil
  1 1/2            cup  warm water

-DAY 1 IN THE MORNING or DAY 1 EVENING: Mix the starter, sugar, potatoes, and water. Let stand on the counter for 8-12 hours uncovered.

- DAY 1 IN THE EVENING or DAY 2 MORNING:

Stir mixture and measure out what you need to make bread.  Bake something else with the remaining mixture, or else store it in the refrigerator for the next time you bake this recipe.

A word on flour: I put in as much of the flour asked for as I can knead in until I don't want to anymore and until it's not sticky -- consequently it's usually less than asked for, and my bread is light and sometimes holey. But we like it that way. This recipe specifically calls for little kneading. That's why it's a real light, almost croissant-type bread.

Mix all the next ingredients in large bowl. Pat top with oil, cover lightly and let rise 8-12 hours at room temp.

DAY 2 IN THE MORNING or DAY 2 EVENING:

Punch dough down and knead just a little. Divide into 3 equal parts. Knead each 12-15 times on floured board. Put into greased loaf pans. Brush tops with oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in pans 8-12 hours at room temp.

DAY 2 IN THE EVENING or DAY 3 MORNING:

Bake at 325-350 deg F for 20-25 minutes for light bread or 30-40 for darker bread. Remove from pans, brush tops with melted butter or margarine, cool on racks. Makes 3 regular loaves.

                        Soy Bread, Thirty Percent

Recipe By     :Veggie Life, May 1997

                Hand Made                       Wheat-Free Breads
                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  soy flour
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour
  3        tablespoons  gluten, wheat
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  soy milk -- warmed
                        Cooking spray or oil

An overnight method allows a slower rise, so the texture develops with less kneading. If time allows, this dough can be made in a more traditional manner...or speed up the entire process by mixing and baking in a bread machine. Up to 50% soy flour can be used (2 cups soy flour, 2 cups white flour), but expect a much richer, denser loaf:

1. In a mixing bowl, stir together flours, gluten, yeast, sugar, and salt to distribute evenly.
2. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients, pour in soy milk, and stir together quickly to mix Knead slightly with back of spoon, just to combine ingredients well and moisten all of the flour. Transfer to a plastic container with ample space and a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate overnight. 3. Next morning, lightly spray or oil a baking sheet. On a lightly floured surface, shape half of the dough into a long, slender baguette. Repeat with second half of dough and place both on prepared sheet. Brush tops with a pastry brush dipped in warm water and slash tops, if desired. Cover with a towel and set in a warm place to rise for an hour, or until almost double. 4. Preheat oven to 400=EA degrees. Bake for 20 minutes or more, just watch for burning! Remove to a rack to cool before cutting.

Makes 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  skim milk
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        ---
  6 1/2            cup  all-purpose flour -- (6 1/2 to 7)
     1/2           tsp  ground ginger
  2         tablespoon  gluten, wheat
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered saffron
  3         tablespoon  orange peel
  2               Tbsp  active dry yeast -- (I use rapid-rise)
                        ---
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     3/4           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  ground blanched almonds -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  dark raisins -- (optional)
                        ---
                        Icing:
  1                cup  sifted powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla -- or almond extract
     3/4    tablespoon  milk -- or orange juice

Place milk in small, microwaveable measure; add butter. Heat on HIGH power for 2-3 minutes; add butter and sugar. Heat on HIGH power, stirring every minute, until butter has melted. Remove and stir in cardamom; let cool to lukewarm.

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine flour, ginger, gluten, salt, saffron, and orange peel into large mixing bowl. Add yeast and combine thoroughly. Add eggs, water, milk mixture, and nuts and raisins (if desired); mix only until dough starts to form a batter -- approximately 10-20 seconds. The dough will be somewhat soft and will not form a ball. If it is too soft you may add additional 1/2 c. flour.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 10 minutes. Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. Repeat.

On lightly floured board, roll one third of dough into a square (approximately 10"). Cut in half, to make two rectangles. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 12 strips. With palm of hand, roll each into a pencil-thin strip, about 6" long. On lightly greased baking sheet, cross strips to make an "X" shape; curl each end into small coil. You may press a raisin into the center of each coil if you wish.

Place buns in warm, draft-free location for the final rise. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 500F while dough is rising.

Brush buns with 1 egg yolk mixed with 1 T. water. Turn heat down to 400 (or 450 if using convection); bake 12-15 minutes; remove from oven when the crusts have turned a nice golden brown; remove to wire racks.

Buns should be allowed to cool for 10 minutes prior to serving. If freezing for future use, allow all items to cool thoroughly before freezing.

Makes: 3 dozen buns


VARIATION:
----------
Buns may be served plain or iced (see below). After removing buns from oven, allow to cool for 10-15 minutes before drizzling icing over tops.

Icing:
-----
Combine ingredients thoroughly. Stir in additional milk or juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, until icing reaches drizzling consistency. Drizzle it over the coffee cake, buns, or sweet rolls.
Makes:  1/2 cup

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast
  2 3/4            cup  Bread Flour
     1/2           cup  Sun-Dried Tomatoes -- Not Oil-Packed
  1               Tbsp  Poppy Seeds
  1               Tbsp  Toasted Sesame Seeds
  1                Tsp  Salt

     1/4           cup  Skim Milk
  1                cup  Water

I toasted the sesame seeds till they were very lightly colored and snipped
the sun-dried tomatoes into large pieces.

I put all the ingredients into the baking basket and set it for light crust
and pushed start.

It rose very high...so if you want it to be a bit more dense cut the water a bit.

This was a very light loaf of incredibly tasting bread!!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  dry yeast
  2               cups  warm water -- (105-115 Fahrenheit)
  2 1/2           cups  rye flour -- medium
     1/4          cups  sugar
     1/4          cups  molasses
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1                tsp  fennel -- crushed or ground
                        Grated rind of 2 oranges
  1                cup  raisins -- light or dark
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- or bread flour
                        -- approximately
  3        tablespoons  shortening
  1         tablespoon  salt

[two large round loaves]

BAKING SHEET:	One baking sheet, greased or Teflon

PREPARATION:	20 mins.

In a large bowl or cup dissolve yeast in water. Stir briskly 	with a fork or whip. Let it stand 5 minutes to begin its fermentation.

With a large wooden spoon stir all of the rye flour, sugar, molasses, cumin, fennel, orange rind, raisins, and about 1.5 cups of white flour into the bowl. Beat until smooth-- about 100 strokes.

		Add 1 cup flour, stir, and beat in the shortening and salt. 		By hand add more flour, a little at a time, until the dough 		cleans the sides of the bowl and is stiff. If a raisin works 		its way out, push it back into the dough. The slight 		discoloration that sometimes comes with working fruit into 		white dough will not be noticed in this dark loaf.

KNEADING:	10 mins.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board or counter top. Since this will be a slightly sticky dough, it may help to grease the fingers before beginning. Knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky.

FIRST RISING:	50 mins.

Put the dough into the large bowl (which has been washed and greased), cover tightly with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place (80-85 f) until it doubles in bulk. You can test if it has risen by poking a finger in it; the dent will remain.

SHAPING: 15 mins.

Punch down dough with quick jabs of the fist and fingers. Turn it over; let rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough onto the board, knead briefly to press out the air. With a sharp knife, cut into two pieces. Pat and roll the dough into round 		balls. Place on opposite corners of the baking sheet. Flatten slightly.

SECOND RISING:	45 mins.

Cover the dough with wax paper or foil and return to the warm place until doubled in volume. You can test if it has risen by poking a finger in it; the dent will remain.


BAKING:	375f,  45 mins.

Preheat the oven to 375f. With a razor blade or sharp knife, slash a cross on top of each loaf. Bake in the oven. When the loaves are crusty and tapping the bottom crust yields a hard and hollow sound, they are done. If not, return to oven for an additional 10 minutes. If the loaves appear to be browning too quickly, cover with a piece of foil or brown sack paper.

FINAL STEP:

Remove from oven and place the loaves on a wire cooling rack.This limpa makes exceptionally good toast. The loaf freezes well.

My observations [Fred]:

This is one TERRIFIC loaf of bread... and the author is correct in his statement that it makes exceptionally good toast but it usually doesn't last long enough to get anywhere near a toaster.

When I make it I tend to find that it needs either a little LESS rye flour, or a little MORE water than the recipe calls for. I'd suggest that you may want to try 2.5 cups of water instead of 2, but you may want to try it as written first, just to see how you like it.

Since it contains quite a bit of rye flour, it's low in gluten, and really does get sticky, so the cautions about dealing with stickiness are entirely appropriate.

Also, since it contains a lot of rye (even more if you don't add extra liquid or cut back the rye a bit because it gets too stiff before you can get all the white flour worked in) it tends to take a lot of kneading and also may not rise well. I'd take that as a hint to do what I suggested above, i.e., add water or cut back on the rye a bit.

Also, it may be my oven, but I find it tends to burn on the bottom if baked at even 350 degrees. The last time I made it I dropped the temperature to around 335-340, and covered the bottom of the baking sheets with aluminum foil (shiny side down) to prevent the bottom from getting so much heat. This just means the crust won't get quite so dark, and it may take a few more minutes in the oven to finish baking.

And, I find it works better to make each loaf on a separate baking sheet, as they tend to crash into each other and become Siamese twins.

NOTES : Here's a recipe for a TERRIFIC loaf of bread. I've made it a number of times for luncheons at church and it's always received with open arms and rave reviews. Afterwards there are always a few people who come around hoping there's some extra they can take home!

This is one of the author's favorite loaves from among a dozen limpa recipes in his files. It has the chili-like flavor of crushed cumin seed, the unmistakable fragrance of fennel, and the pleasant goodness of orange. Studded with raisins, the loaf rises up to become a handsome brown ball. It sends forth a good aroma when toasted and buttered.

6)  chopped prunes, orange peel, crushed pecans

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine first six ingredients into large mixing bowl. Add yeast and combine thoroughly.
Add remaining ingredients; mix only until dough starts to form a batter -- approximately 10-20 seconds. The dough will be very soft and delicate, and will not form a ball.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. Repeat.

Divide dough into three equal-sized pieces.

For coffee cake: Lightly grease a coffee cake tin (I use one with a pretty design imprinted in the metal, so that the resulting cake has this design) and place one large piece into the tin.

For buns: Divide one large piece into 12 equal-sized pieces. Shape into balls and place each in a lightly-greased muffin tin or molds.

For sweet rolls: On a floured surface, roll one large piece into a rectangle approximately 1/4" thick. Cover with filling (see ideas below); roll up in jelly-roll fashion and slice into 1" pieces. Arrange in a lightly greased pan, slightly touching.

Place all in warm, draft-free location for the final rise. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 500F while dough is rising (With this many pieces it is helpful to have two ovens available. If you do not, you may wish to place some of the items into the refrigerator for baking later -- sweet rolls are ideal for this as they can be baked fresh in time for breakfast).

OPTIONAL STEP: When the pieces have doubled in size, combine 3 egg whites with 4 t. water. Mix well; then brush the tops of the pieces with the glaze.

Turn heat down to 350 (or 325 if using convection); immediately uncover pieces and place into oven. Coffee cake will take approximately 35-40 minutes, 20-30 minutes for the buns and sweet rolls. Remove from oven when the crusts have turned a nice golden brown; place on cooling racks.

For sweet rolls: these may be served plain or iced (see below). Serve after cooling for approximately 10 minutes.

Buns should be allowed to cool for 10 minutes prior to serving; coffee cake for 15-20 minutes. Sweet rolls may be served after about 10 minutes of cooling. If freezing for future use, allow all items to cool thoroughly before freezing.

Icing:
-----
Combine ingredients thoroughly.  Stir in additional milk or juice, 1
teaspoon at a time, until icing reaches drizzling consistency.
Drizzle it over the coffee cake, buns, or sweet rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 lb: -- -1.5 lb:
     2/3           cup  water -- 1 cup
  1              wedge  cabbage -- (1") 1-1/2 " wedge
  1              piece  carrot -- (4") 6" piece
  2               cups  whole wheat flour -- 3 cups
  4          teaspoons  gluten, wheat -- 1-1/2 tbsp.
  1                tsp  yeast -- 1-1/2 tsp.
     1/2           tsp  sea salt -- 3/4 tsp.
  1         tablespoon  lecithin granules -- 1-1/2 Tbsp.
                        -- or vegetable oil

Put the water, cabbage, and carrot in a blender and process for 1 minute
or until vegetables are completely pulverized.  Then put this mixture and the
remaining ingredients in the bread machine's pan and turn the machine on.

Soft and moist, this bread is also super-nutritious.  Sugars naturally
present in the carrots and cabbage feed the yeast, eliminating the need for added sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  boiling water
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat kernels -- or wheat berries
     1/2           cup  warm water
     1/2          TBSP  sugar
  2           packages  active dry yeast -- (TBSP)
     1/3           cup  rye flour
     1/3           cup  whole-meal flour -- whole-wheat flour
  6               cups  white flour -- (6 to 7)
  1               TBSP  salt
  1                cup  warm milk
                        -- or milk substitute
  1                cup  warm water

Pour:
     2 cups boiling water poured over:
     1/2 cup whole-wheat kernels, or wheat berries, (available in health
         food stores)
Allow to stand for two hours to soften the berries.  Proof the yeast as
follows:
      1/2 cup warm water,
     1 TBSP sugar,
     2 packages (TBSP) active dry yeast.
While the yeast is proofing, combine in a bowl:
     1/3 cup rye flour,
     1/3 cup whole-meal, whole-wheat flour,
     3 cups white flour,
     the drained wheat berries, and
     1 TBSP salt.
Add:

the proofed yeast mixture from above, 1 cup of warm milk, and 1 cup of warm water. (Note that you may use the water that was used to soak the wheat berries.) Knead well for about 10 minutes, adding additional: white flour about 1/2 cup at a time. You may need to add 3 more cups, give or take a bit.

Form into a ball, place in greased bowl covered. Rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut in two, form loaves, and allow to rise again. You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl. If so, James feels that the bread may need some help in the second rising, in the form of a bit of heat. As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 F. oven. This bread should have a good crunchy crust. I have made this loaf without the wheat berries, as the crust and bread is delightful without the berries, and some members of the family refer to soft berries as "erasers" and hard berries as "rocks" - refusing to eat bread with either. However, with a bit of practice, you will be able to use the wheat berries at the right point so they will be neither "rocks" or "erasers".

                       White Bread #4, Hard-Crusted

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                Lbs  white bread flour -- (approx. 6-2/3 cups)
  3                Tsp  salt
  2                Tsp  yeast
  2               Cups  water -- approximately
     1/4      Teaspoon  sugar

Add 1/4 tsp sugar to 1/2 cup warm water and stir in the yeast.

Measure the flour into a mixing bowl . Dissolve the salt in the remaining water, then add the water to the flour, and add the yeast. Add water if necessary to make dough, then mix well and knead for about 10 minutes

Turn the dough into a heavy crockery bowl but DO NOT oil the dough or bowl; it isn't necessary.

Raise the dough fairly cool, 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the first four hours. Deflate by going around the bowl gently pushing the dough in using a moistened spatula. Remove the dough and turn it over for the second rising.

Punch down and knead another 7 minutes. Let dough rise but this time at 75 to 80 degrees t for about two hours. Deflate the dough again, and cut it in half. Shape each half into a ball being careful not to tear the gluten 'skin' on the dough. Bakes much better on tile or in flowerpot bottom (works just fine). Let rise about 45-55 minutes at about 90 degrees. Looks like it doesn't rise, but it will in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.

Put the proofed loaves into the oven and turn it down to 450 degrees. Twenty minutes later turn down again to 400. Bake about another hour at 400 degrees. Turn part way through if your oven heats unevenly . The crust is supposed to be very dark -- it is burned a little on the outside but will extend nearly half an inch into the bread. The crumb should be stretchy and airy with large holes similar to a sourdough.

NOTE: Constructed a raising oven out of a cardboard box, dimmer switch and lightbulb socket. I heat with a 40-watt bulb and read the temperature in the box by sticking my instant- read cook's thermometer through a small hole for the purpose; I just leave the thermometer in the box for the duration. While this may seem a little overzealous, it is not hard to construct and pays immense dividends in repeatability. For humidity control I rely on a doubled dish towel moistened and covering the dough bowl.
