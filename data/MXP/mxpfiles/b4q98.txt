NOTES : There is a yellow almond cake recipe that calls for 1 whole almond to be inserted. Served on New Years Eve or New Years Day, the person who receives that almond will be the first to enjoy *good luck* for the coming year.

So, I'm making this Almond Oatmeal Bread, and have inserted an almond after the last kneading cycle. I'll spend tonight baking loaves for each of our neighboring houses as a "Happy New Year" gift from my new "Home-baked Heaven" business <soft smile!>

DINA'S BREAD SPREAD BRAINSTORM

Non-dairy:

- Hummus (Comes in 8 or 16 oz tub, most supermarkets, usually refrigerated, made of pureed chick peas, garlic, sesame seed, lemon, and spices. Comes in flavors like roasted red pepper, extra garlic, vegetable, etc. Very nutritious. Also makes a good sandwich filling with lettuce, tomato, sprouts, etc.)

- Bean dip (Comes in a jar, not refrigerated. Find by the salsa in the store. Black bean and white bean are 2 tasty, and usually fat free, varieties available. Very nutritious. Best thing to do is find a recipe at the library and make your own!)

- Tofutti "Better than cream cheese" (nondairy cream cheese - not terribly low in fat, but if you use just a little it is! Comes in many flavors. Made of tofu and vegetable gums. Find in specialty food stores, particularly in Jewish neighborhoods. Contains soy protein, which has been linked to reduced risk of many diseases.)

- "Bread Spreads" (Jars of different flavors of bread spreads, found in the condiment aisle of Bread & Circus. One was an artichoke spread. I forget the other flavors but the artichoke one was yummy. Low fat too.)

- Soy nut butter (Like peanut butter but lower in fat and made of roasted soybeans rather than peanuts. While not very low in fat, it's high in soy protein, which has been linked to reduced risk of many diseases. To keep it low fat, use a very light layer and top with some jam or jelly.)

Non-dairy, reduced fat margarine substitute spreads:

- Canoleo (Made mostly of canola oil, very low in saturated fats. Find in a tub at whole foods market.)

- Olivio (Made mostly of olive oil, very low in saturated fats. Find in a tub at whole foods market.)

- Spectrum Spread (Free of saturated and trans fatty acids. Find in a tub at whole foods market. Has a different taste than most margarine-like spreads.)

Dairy:

- Strained cottage cheese blended with fruit

- Reduced fat strawberry cream cheese (I find it to be as tasty as the fatty stuff)

NOTES : This recipe gives both measurements for the whole wheat and unbleached flour. You can either use the cups or measure it by the weight.
I have found from experience with this book that the recipes are far more superior if you weigh the flours instead of measuring by the cup. As the book explained, the reason for this is because all flours weigh differently and you do not get the right abouts if measured by cup (ie. wheat flour is a heavier flour which requires gluten to help it rise. If you used the same amount of a lighter flour it would put too much flour into the recipe and cause it to be too dry among other things.) I use a small digital scale when I measure my flours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  lukewarm water
     2/3           cup  molasses
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  5               cups  bread flour -- up to 6
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  semolina
  1         tablespoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter -- softened

MAKES 2 LOAVES (20 SLICES)       LACTO

Anadama refers to the sweet and savory flavor combinations of cornmeal and molasses used frequently by the colonists for bread making. Our version also uses semolina, a durum wheat that is more coarsely ground than other flours. It enhances both taste and texture. Look for semolina flour in specialty food shops or Italian markets.

IN MEDIUM BOWL, combine water and molasses. Add yeast and let stand until dissolved and foamy, about 10 minutes.

In large bowl, combine 5 cups flour, cornmeal, semolina and salt. Add butter, then yeast mixture and mix well. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead by adding as much of the remaining flour as necessary to make a soft but not sticky dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes.

Transfer dough to lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/4 hours.

Punch down dough and turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Cut dough into 2 equal pieces and form into oblong loaves. Place in two oiled 8- by 4-inch loaf pans and cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 F. Bake until loaves are golden brown on top, about 40 minutes. Let cool in pans for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

NOTES : I found this wonderful recipe tonight, and thought you guys might enjoy it, since I rarely send anything, I thought maybe a change of the season treat might ply you all <g>.

                        basic white bread dough
     3/4          part  sunflower seeds -- roasted
     1/4                pine nuts -- roasted
  6                     chopped dried apricots
  3                     crushed cardamon pods

Last week I made a tasty loaf by adding about a cupful of lightly roasted seeds (3/4 sunflower, 1/4 pine nuts), about 6 chopped up dried apricots and 3 crushed cardamons to my normal white bread recipe. I also used grade '0' (pasta type) flour but would guess that standard strong would do. Just before baking I brushed with milk and coated with white poppy seeds. This was lovely with cheese such as gooey ripe brie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Dough:
  1 1/2           cups  Warm Water -- (110-115 Deg F)
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
  1                Pkg  Yeast
  3 1/4           cups  All-Purpose Flour -- Note 1
  2                Tsp  Salt
                        Topping:
  2               Tbsp  Olive Oil
  1                     Roma Tomato -- Sliced Thin
  2               Tbsp  Chiffonade Of Basil
     1/4          cups  Grated Parmesan Cheese -- (2 Oz)

Recipe Courtesy of Emeril Lagasse

Note 1: you may need more to achieve the smooth elasticity

In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over that mixture and let stand for 10 minutes, to bloom (it should begin to foam.) In the mixer bowl with the dough hook attached, add 3 cups of flour, salt and yeast mixture. Slowly turn it on and work the dough together. Turn it up to medium and mix for 5 minutes. If the dough is sticky, continue mixing and gradually add the remaining flour. Place this smooth ball of dough into an oiled bowl, cover and set aside to rise for 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Punch down the dough, and remove it from the bowl onto a lightly oiled, 9 x 13-inch sheet tray. Spread the dough out onto the sheet tray. Using your fingertips, make "dimples" in the dough. Drizzle the dough with olive oil, sprinkle on the basil, spread out the tomato slices, sprinkle on the cheese and bake for 30 - 35 minutes.

Yields: 6 appetizers

NOTES : My Mom has tinkered with  a basic bread recipe and if you want a lighter than air recipe for white bread here it is:

This makes a LARGE two pound loaf or if you just use the dough cycle, it can be risen twice and oven baked to make 2 regular loaves of bread. The loaf will feel like air in your hands. Good luck getting any of it for yourself!

                        -- 1 1/2 Lb. Loaf
  1 1/4           cups  Water
  1 1/2           Tbsp  Canola Oil
  1 1/2           Tbsp  Honey

NOTES : This recipe gives both measurements for the whole wheat and unbleached flour. You can either use the cups or measure it by the weight.
I have found from experience with this book that the recipes are far more superior if you weigh the flours instead of measuring by the cup. As the book explained, the reason for this is because all flours weigh differently and you do not get the right abouts if measured by cup (ie. wheat flour is a heavyier flour which requires gluten to help it rise. If you used the same amount of a lighter flour it would put too much flour into the recipe and cause it to be too dry among other things.) I use a small digital scale when I measure my flours.

                              Bulgur Breads

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads     Yeast Free


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  fine or medium bulgur
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  boiling water
     1/2           cup  minced onion
                        Approximately 2 cups unbleached hard
                        white flour
                        -- or all-purpose flour

You will need a medium-sized bowl, a food processor (optional), unglazed quarry tiles to fit on the bottom rack of your oven, and a rolling pin.

Place the bulgur and salt in a food processor, pour the boiling water over, and stir or process briefly to mix. Let stand for thirty minutes. When you come back to the bulgur mixture, it will look like the bulgur has totally absorbed the water. However, proceed by adding 1 cup flour and the minced onion, and process for 1 minute. The dough should come together into a large ball as you process. If it doesn't, feel the dough: If it feels dry and floury, start the processor, add 2 tablespoons warm water and process for 30 seconds; again if the bulgur and flour still don't come together, add another 2 tablespoons water and process. Once a ball of dough forms, process for 2 to 3 minutes longer, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. (If your processor is too small to handle the whole dough, work with half at a time, adding 1/2 cup flour to each portion, then combine when you turn out of the processor and knead by hand). Knead by hand for 4 to 5 minutes.

Alternatively, if you do not have a food processor, combine bulgur, salt and boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let stand for 30 minutes. Add onions and 1/2 cup flour and stir in. Add another 1/2 cup flour and use your hands to fold flour into the dough. With a little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat sticky) that you can knead. Turn out onto a well-floured kneading surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes. Dough will be sticky at first, but will soon come together into a smooth workable dough; you may be surprised to discover how kneadable bulgur is.

When finished kneading, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand until you are ready to proceed further, for 15 minutes to an hour, whatever is convenient.

To bake, have your oven preheated to 450 degrees with baking stone or quarry tiles in place on a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, and flatten each on a well-floured bread board. With a rolling pin, roll out one or two breads until very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Work with only one or two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven. When ready, handle the bread gently as you place it on the hot tiles. (You can also try dusting a peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour and using peel or sheet to transfer breads to hot tiles.) Bake on one side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The bread should begin to brown around the outside. When baked, keep breads warm by stacking them one on top of the other and wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel. Serve warm.

Yield: 8 thin, supple and slightly chewy flatbreads between 8 and 10 inches in diameter.

NOTES : The dough for this cracker-like unyeasted flatbread is easily mixed in the food processor. The breads have a wonderful aroma as they bake and a satisfying savory taste, for the dough is made of full-grain bulgur, with only a little flour, and flavored with minced onion. The breads bake quickly in the oven. Bulgur breads go wonderfully with cheese, or strong flavors. Leave them to dry out and use as crackers, or wrap in a cloth to keep chewy and supple

  1               part  butter
  1               part  vegetable oil

I received several suggestions for alternative to butter. So far, I have tried the one that looked the easiest. It was Max Prola's, which was to mix butter with an equal volume of vegetable oil.

I am very happy with the results. I use canola oil since it is the = lowest in saturated fat. That's also what I add to the bread when baking. In addition to reducing saturated fats by (almost) 50%, there would also be a reduction in salt. Most butter is salted. If you have ever tasted the unsalted variety, you know why. Another pleasant outcome is that the mixture is just the right consistency for spreading when you take it out of the fridge. I always found butter too hard, even when kept in the butter compartment.

NOTES : My friend Cecilia sent me the recipe for cabin rolls that sounds great. Thought you might enjoy trying this simple recipe.I made the Cabin Rolls the other day, first thing in the morning. I took them to work while they were still warm, and we had them for breakfast. They are really good alone, great with just butter and even better with blackberry jelly <smile>. (Of course I had to eat 3 rolls to make sure not to mix the flavors.... )

If you add the butter and jelly, they go very well with coffee, but since they are not sweet, so they would go very well with meat and gravy. Though they are not made with yeast, they still have a 'roll' type texture, and I am planning on making a bunch this weekend to freeze for Thanksgiving dinner. They are extremely easy to make, so it's even something the kids can do. I haven't tried adding any ingredients, but I'll bet they'd be good with cheese or bacon bits, or onions... mmmm now I'm getting hungry again.. ["Caron Rose" <crose@sbd.com>]

                        apricots
     1/2          cups  Golden raisins

Spray loaf pan with non-stick spray. Open pineapple and drain off juice. Mix dry ingredients together in large bowl. In blender, process together applesauce, egg, bananas and pineapple add to dry mixture, add apricots and raisins, beat just till well mixed. Turn into loaf pan, bake in preheated 350F oven for 60 minutes or until golden and tests done. Remove from pan and rest on a board or rack on its side till completely cooled. Refrigerate wrapped. Freezes well.

Now for the variables, You may make this recipe with no apricots but with one fresh apple, chopped ( not peeled). You may make this recipe with or without raisins. Less sweet but good both ways. If you don't have the soy flour or the dry milk, just add the equivalent of flour or oat bran.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***SPONGE***
  1                cup  lukewarm water
     1/2      teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  bread flour
                        ***BREAD***
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  firmly packed brown sugar
  2                     sweet onions
                        sliced into 1/4-inch rings
  1                cup  lukewarm water
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper

2 LOAVES (20 SLICES ) DAIRY-FREE

The best type of onions for caramelizing are the sweet varieties, such as Vidalia, Maui and Walla Walla. If none of these are available, use yellow onions. This bread requires advance planning and preparation. Letting the yeast mixture or "sponge", sit overnight enhances the bread's wheat flavor.

SPONGE: Place 1 cup water in mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water and stir in. Let sir for 2 minutes. Mix in 1 cup bread flour. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sir overnight or for 14 to 16 hours.

Heat oil and sugar in heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat for 1 minute. Add onions and saute, stirring occasionally until browned and caramelized, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.

Place water in bowl of electric mixer or in mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water and stir in. Let sit for 2 minutes. Add sponge, both flours, salt and pepper. Mix with dough hook until ingredients are combined, about 2 minutes. Or beat vigorously with a wooden spoon for 8 to 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 15 minutes. Add caramelized onions and resume mixing, until dough is silky and elastic and pulls away from sides of bowl. Dough should be very wet and sticky but still elastic.

Transfer dough to lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn over a baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal or flour. Place dough on a well-floured work surface, handling it gently to preserve as much volume as possible; cut into 2 equal pieces.

Gently pull and stretch each piece of dough into a flat round, about 1 A inches thick. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour.

Preheat oven to 450 F. Using a spray bottle, spritz oven walls with water.
Work quickly so oven does nor lose heat. Bake until bread browns, about 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer flatbreads to a rack to cool.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  Bread Flour
  1 1/2           cups  Whole Wheat Flour
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  3               Tbsp  Sugar -- Or
                        Barley Malt Syrup
  2                Tsp  Salt
  1                Tsp  Dill Seed
  1                Tsp  Celery Seed
  2               cups  Lukewarm Water
  1               Tbsp  Cornmeal
                        Egg Wash -- Optional
                        Dill Seed -- Optional
                        To Sprinkle On Top

In a mixing bowl, stir together flours, yeast, sugar (if using), salt, dill seed, and celery seed. If using barley malt syrup, stir it into water. Add to bowl with dry ingredients and mix to form a stiff dough. (Mixture will seem dry and shaggy at this point, but light kneading will bring it together.)

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough lightly into a smooth ball and return to bowl. Cover with plastic an set aside in a warm place for an hour to rest. (At this point the dough may be refrigerated for several hours. Set out at room temp for about 2 hrs before proceeding to step 3.)

Preheat oven to 400F. Lightly spray or brush a baking sheet with oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Set a large pot of water and 1 Tbsp sugar to boil.

On a lightly floured surface, turn out dough and divide in half. Return one half to bowl and divide the other into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into smooth ball. Flatten balls slightly, push thumbs through center, place index fingers inside, and roll into a smooth, open bagel shape. (Dough will rise to fill in hole if it isn't large enough.)

Drop 3 bagels into boiling water and boil gently, turning often, for 5 min.
Using a strainer or slotted spoon, remove bagels carefully. Rest spoon briefly on towel to remove excess water and set bagels a few inches apart, on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining 3 bagels.

Brush bagels with egg wash and sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for about 30 min, until glossy and well browned. Repeat with second half of dough.

Makes 12 bagels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  lukewarm water -- (110F, 40C)
  3           packages  dry yeast -- (21 g)
  4        tablespoons  sugar -- (60 ml)
  5               cups  all-purpose flour -- (1.25 to 1.5 L)
                        -- (5 to 6)
  2                tsp  salt -- (10 ml)
  3                     eggs
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- (60 ml)
  1                tsp  vegetable oil -- (5ml)
  1                     egg yolk -- combined with
  2        tablespoons  water -- (30 ml)

Combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the water with the yeast and 1 tsp (5 ml) of the sugar. Stir to dissolve the yeast and allow to rest in a warm place for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl combine 4 cups (1 L) of the flour, the remaining sugar, and the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, the remaining water, the 3 eggs, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the vegetable oil. Gently stir with a wooden spoon to combine, then beat vigorously until all the flour is absorbed. Add up to 2 cups (500 ml) more flour until the dough can be gathered into a soft ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for about 15 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Sprinkle as necessary with additional flour to keep it from sticking. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover loosely with a dish towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, until the dough has doubled in volume. Punch the dough down and knead for a few minutes to deflate completely. Return to the bowl and allow to rise for 15 minutes. Coat a large baking sheet with the remaining 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vegetable oil. Traditionally the bread is divided into quarters and braided in four parts, but this process is impossible for me to describe without the aid of illustrations. You will achieve acceptable results by dividing it into three parts, rolling each into a length of about 24 inches (60 cm), thicker in the middle and tapered at the ends, and braiding them. Pinch the dough together at both ends and carefully place the loaf on the baking sheet and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes. Brush the top with the egg yolk and water mixture and bake in the middle of a pre-heated 400F (200C) oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375F (180C) and bake an additional 30 to 40 minutes, or until the challah is crusty and golden brown. Makes one loaf.

NOTES : I was planning to do a recipe for challah (the traditional Jewish bread) to wrap up our "Cooking of Israel" week, but I received so many requests for sufganiot (the Jewish jelly donut) that I decided to do that instead. But then I asked myself "Chef, (that's better than what I used to call myself) what about your tens of thousands of adoring and admiring readers who will be disappointed, if not downright depressed, if you don't do the challah recipe like you promised?"

I decided, in my never ending quest to satisfy all of the people all of the time and to achieve TOTAL READER SATISFACTION (trumpets and cymbals here), to include a recipe for the donuts along with the challah. So here you have it, ladies and gentlemen, two recipes for the price of... none?

                        French Bread dough
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  cheddar cheese

For the bread I added about 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper and about the same amount of sweet basil to a 2 loaf sourdough french bread recipe. (Actually 1 teaspoon is a very rough estimation. Actually I just ground the pepper directly over the dough after I had turned it out on the table, and ground away until the dough was fairly well covered!)

When I shaped the loaves, I kneaded in about 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese. (Again, I just cut off a chunk of cheese, and grated it onto the dough.)

This recipe was adapted from Mel London's "Bread Winners" cookbook.

  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  white sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  warm water or milk

  2        tablespoons  white sugar

     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
                        -- 24  2 inch squares of wax paper

1. Mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 cup warm water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.

2. Mix in 1/2 cup warm water or milk, flour, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and lard or vegetable oil. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

3. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.

4. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok. Cover wok with lid. Steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes.

5. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked.

                Nut & Seed Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6 1/2           cups  bread flour
  2       tablespoons.  vital wheat gluten
     1/2         cups.  powdered milk
     1/4         cups.  brown sugar -- firmly packed
  2         teaspoons.  salt
  4 1/2     teaspoons.  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
                        ---
  4              Tbsp.  softened butter
                        -- or butter-flavor soft shortening
  2              Tbsp.  active dry yeast
                        -- (I use rapid-rise)
     3/4         cups.  chopped pecans -- (3/4 to 1)
     1/4         cups.  cracked flax seed -- (optional)
                        ---
  2 1/4          cups.  lukewarm water

Yield:  2 oval loaves -or- 8-10 buns

(For KithcenAid)

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine all dry ingredients except yeast into large mixing bowl. Add butter (or shortening) and combine. Add yeast, nuts, and seeds (optional); combine thoroughly. Add water; mix only until dough starts to form a ball and mixer begins to labor a bit -- approximately 10-20 seconds.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 9-10 minutes.

Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. Repeat for second rising.

Punch down dough; divide into two equal-sized pieces. Form into oval loaves and place on lightly greased (I use Pam cooking spray) baking sheets. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location until loaves have almost doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 400F while dough is rising in loaf pans.

Turn heat down to 375 (or 325 if using convection); immediately uncover loaves and place into oven for 35-40 minutes, or until crusts are nicely browned and loaves test done. Remove to cooling racks. As soon as loaves are removed from oven, melt butter over low heat and brush lightly over crusts for softer crust.

Allow loaves to cool for at least 60 minutes before slicing. If freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 2 hours).

---------------------------

VARIATION: this dough makes wonderful cinnamon-pecan buns. After second rising, divide dough into 8-10 balls and place on lightly greased baking sheet. Let rise; bake as indicated, but reduce baking time (this will vary slightly depending on size of buns). Remove from oven when buns are lightly browned and test done by tapping on the bottom with a forefinger (you should hear a hollow
"thunk").

                        ---
  1                     egg
  2              cups.  lukewarm water minus 2 Tbsp.
  2              Tbsp.  lemon juice
                        ---
  1              cups.  raisins -- (1 to 1 1/2)
                        -- (may use sultanas/ currants -- regular
                        -- or golden  raisins)
                        ---
  3       tablespoons.  unsalted butter

Yield:  2 standard-sized loaves (using loaf pans)or 6-8 buns


(for KitchenAid)

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine all dry ingredients except yeast into large mixing bowl. Add butter (or shortening) and combine. Add yeast and combine thoroughly. Add water, lemon juice, and egg; mix only until dough starts to form a ball and mixer begins to labor a bit -- approximately 10-20 seconds.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 9-10 minutes. Add raisins in 1/2-cup increments during last 4-5 minutes of kneading.

Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. Repeat for second rising.

Punch down dough; divide into two equal-sized pieces. Form into loaves and place in lightly greased (I use Pam cooking spray) loaf pans. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location until dough reaches the top of the loaf pans.

Preheat oven to 400F while dough is rising in loaf pans.

Turn heat down to 375 (or 325 if using convection); immediately uncover loaves and place into oven for 35 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and place back into oven, baking for approximately 10-15 additional minutes, or until crusts are nicely browned and loaves test done. Remove to cooling racks. As soon as loaves are removed from oven, melt butter over low heat and brush lightly over crusts for softer crust.

Allow loaves to cool for at least 60 minutes before slicing. If freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 2 hours).

This recipe yields an extremely fluffy, airy loaf with a very pleasant texture which is perfect for making raisin toast.

VARIATION: this dough makes wonderful cinnamon-raisin buns. After second rising, divide dough into 6-8 balls and place on lightly greased baking sheet. Let rise; bake as indicated, but reduce baking time (this will vary slightly depending on size of buns).

                Sweet Breads & Cakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               cube  butter
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              small  pinch salt
  1                cup  milk
  4               cups  white flour
  3          teaspoons  yeast

Add to your bread machine - in the order listed. (I have a Zo)

Start machine on "dough" cycle. Watch the dough and add flour as necessary (during the first knead cycle only). I let the dough rest for an hour or so after it's finished. (the first rise). Then divide the dough in half. Roll it out, spread with a total of another cube of butter and a sugar cinnamon mixture (I use about three teaspoons cinnamon and 3/4 cups sugar). Roll up the dough and butter mixture - slice into rolls, and place in a pan where they will have plenty of room to rise. If there's any butter left, drizzle it over the top. Do the same with any remaining sugar and cinnamon..... Put them in a warm place to rise again. I give them another 90 minutes or so, unless they're growing out of control.... Bake at 375 for approximately 25 minutes. Take them out and immediately turn them out onto a sheet of foil. This way the butter - goo mixture stays on the bottom of the rolls.

NOTES : Here is my recipe for cinnamon rolls - they're definitely an occasional indulgence! My recipe is not too exact - I go alot on looks.....

These taste really good while still hot. My Mom used to put more butter on the top - but she was a true fan of butter!

  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                tsp  baking soda

  1 1/4           cups  raw cranberries -- roughly chopped
  3                tsp  grated orange rind

Sift the flour with the soda, baking powder, and salt. Beat the eggs and sugar until well blended. Stir in the melted butter, milk, and orange juice. Stir in the flour mixture just until moistened, and then fold in the cranberries. Do not overwork or beat the dough. Butter a loaf tin about 10 inches long and 4 to 5 inches wide and spread the dough in the tin. Bake in a preheated 350 oven for about 55 to 60 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. (The top will often crack; this is typical of soda and baking powder breads.) Let stand in the tin for a few minutes before turning out on a rack to cool. When thoroughly cooled, wrap in plastic or foil and let stand overnight or at least a day before cutting.

NOTES : My family loves to have pumpkin bread and cranberry bread for Thanksgiving, in addition to some nice dinner rolls. (I also love these breads for breakfast etc. after the feast.) Last week's postings had a pumpkin bread very similar to mine, so I'm only posting the cranberry bread recipe I use. It is from James Beard's Beard on Bread (minus nuts, if it ever had any--we have a nut allergy in the family). It is nice and moist and keeps/freezes well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bread Dough:
  8                oz.  sour cream
     1/2           cup  butter
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1               tsp.  salt
  2              pkgs.  yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  2                     eggs
  4               cups  flour
                        ---
                        Filling:
  2              pkgs.  cream cheese -- (8 ounce) softened
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/8          tsp.  salt
  2              tsps.  vanilla
                        ---
                        Glaze:
  2               cups  sifted powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  milk
  2              tsps.  vanilla

Scald sour cream; add sugar, butter, salt. Mix well and let cool until lukewarm. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl; stir in sour cream mixture and then eggs. Gradually stir in flour (dough will be soft.) Cover lightly and chill overnight.

Divide dough into four equal portions. Turn each portion out on a heavily floured surface and knead four or five times. Roll each into a 12 x 8" rectangle. Spread 1/4 of filling over each rectangle, leaving a 1/2 inch margin around the edges. Carefully roll up jellyroll-fashion, beginning at long side. Firmly pinch edge and ends to seal. Carefully place rolls, seam side down, on greased baking sheet.

Make six equally spaced X-shapes across the top of each loaf. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees) free from drafts until doubled in bulk (about four hours). Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Spread loaves with glaze while warm. Yield: 4 12-inch loaves.
Filling:
Combine all ingredients.  Mix well.  Yield:  About 2 cups.

Glaze:
Combine all ingredients, mixing well.  Yield:  About 1 cup.

In the mixer bowl, dissolve the sugar in the water. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water mixture and let it stand for 10 minutes, until it foams. Combine 3 cups of the flour, salt and cinnamon. Add to the yeast mixture. Slowly turn on the machine and work the dough together. Turn it up to medium and mix for 5 minutes. If the dough is sticky, continue mixing and gradually add the remaining flour. Place this smooth ball of dough in an oiled bowl , cover and set aside to rise for 3 hours.

Preheat the grill and preheat the oven to 375F. Punch down the dough, remove it from the bowl onto a lightly oiled 9x13-inch sheet tray. Spread out the dough on the tray. Using your fingertips, make "dimples" in the dough. Using the olive oil, lightly oil the pears and place them on the grill. Meanwhile, mix the honey, mascarpone, and the mint together. Spread this mixture on the dough. Turn the pears and cook for 1 more minute. Top the dough with the grilled pears. Bake for 25 minutes. Cut into 6 pieces. Serve.

Yield: 6 fun desserts

NOTES : I make these rolls at Thanksgiving, but also many other times during the year. They are wonderful. I keep sourdough starter in the fridge and use it for a portion of the liquid. Can also use all water if you don't have sourdough starter.

     2/3           cup  semi-sweet choco chips

Select loaf size and add ingredients to machine according to machine directions.

Just a few things that I've found work better for me.... I used the mini chips... if you can find them.. and they tend to spread out better in the dough..... and I put them in at the beginning, rather than waiting until the last knead cycle - otherwise they tend to sit at the bottom of the bread. You can also add cinnamon to the bread - (1/4 tsp for the 1 lb. and 1/2 tsp for the 1 1/2 lb.)... and they call it Mexican double choc. bread. Anyway you do it... it comes out mouth watering.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

Firm Dough (La Pate Ferme): rarely used, except for regional large loaves. Consists of 52- 55% water, i.e., two cups of water to every 6 cups of flour.
When home bakers make the dough too firm, the bread has good shape and expansion, but a tight and dry texture.

Regular Dough(La Pate Batarde): used for most breads. Consists of 60-62% water or 2 1/2 cups water for every 6 cups of flour.

Moist Dough(La Pate Douce): used for bread sculpture, requires strong flour. Consists of 65% water or 2 3/4 cups water for every six cups of flour.

Very wet dough(La Pate Tres Molle): used by some Italian bakers. Consists of 70% water or 3 cups water for every six cups of water. Must be baked thoroughly so the crust won't be rubbery.

Jazzbel's Note: Joe Ortis uses mostly all-purpose flour in his recipes, so I thing the quantities of water refer to that flour, except for the Moist Dough.

  2        tablespoons  Sugar
  1            package  Active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  All-purpose flour

     1/4      teaspoon  Nutmeg
     3/4           cup  Eggnog -- at room temp.*

I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for the eggnog bread which you read about.
Here is what I did; you may need to make adaptations for whatever type of
b/m you have. Play with it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at
a time.) If too dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!! * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness button slightly
lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt).

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm milk
  1                cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1            package  yeast
                        -- (dry or fresh)
  4               cups  white flour
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
                        Corn meal

Makes about 20 muffins

Warm milk to "baby bottle" temperature (about 100F.). Stir in honey, salt and melted butter. Mix yeast in warm water (same temperature as milk) and stir until dissolved. Mix water and milk mixtures together.

Add the whole wheat flour to liquid, plus 2 cups of the white flour. Beat until it is a smooth mixture, about 2 or 3 minutes.

Add remaining flour 1/3 cup at a time until dough becomes stiff. Turn on to floured surface and knead for 4 or 5 minutes. Dust on more flour as needed to make dough manageable. Dough has been kneaded long enough when it is stiff and elastic enough to "rebound" when a dent is made in the dough with a light push of a finger.

Place in large bowl and cover with towel or lid. Let rise at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until it doubles in volume.

Punch dough down and turn out onto lightly floured surface. With a rolling pin, roll dough out to about a 1/2 inch thickness. With a cookie cutter or glass 3 to 4 inches in diameter (plastic cups are perfect at 3 1/2"), cut out muffins. Move cut muffins to a board sprinkled freely with the corn meal. After you have cut out muffins from the first rolling of the dough, reform the dough scraps and roll out again and cut. Repeat process until all the dough has been used or the dough is too dry to roll out.

Cover muffins with a towel and let rise for 30 to 45 minutes in a warm draft free area.

Very lightly grease a griddle and pre-heat to medium. Carefully place risen muffins griddle, corn meal side down first, and cook for 10 minutes. (Watch your heat;muffin bottoms should be lightly golden brown after 4 or 5 minutes. If too light or dark, increase or reduce heat as necessary). After 10 minutes on first side, flip over and cook the other side of muffin for 10 minutes.

Cool on wire racks. Muffins will keep for 4 or 5 days at room temperature in a plastic bag, or for several months if wrapped tight and stored in the freezer.

To serve, split with fork. Insert fork around edges of muffin until it separates into two halves. Toast under broiler if desired.

NOTES : This is my favorite sandwich style loaf bread and not a country style or free form bread. At first glance, this may look like allot of steps to make the bread. But when you have your first slice, you may just forget about the steps. I like it best toasted with butter and jam or as my favorite toasted sandwich. Recipe yields two large loafs so freeze one for the future....

Baking tips for Flaxseed Meal:
Ground flaxseed can be substituted for shortening or cooking oil at a ratio of 3:1 in baked goods. For example, 1 1/2 cups of ground flaxseed can replace 1/2 cup butter, margarine or oil in a recipe. Baked goods substituting flaxseed meal for oil tend to brown more quickly.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  bread Flour
  1        tablespoons  Dried rosemary
  2                Tsp  Salt

                        Olive Oil

Mix 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the rosemary, salt, and yeast in a large bowl thoroughly. Add 3 tablespoons oil and the hot water. Beat on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on medium speed 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead 5 to 8 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm place about 1 hour or until double. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.) Punch down dough. Brush 12-inch pizza pan or large cookie sheet with oil. Press dough in pizza pan or flatten into 12" circle on cookie sheet. Make depressions, with fingers about 2 inches apart, into dough. Brush with oil; sprinkle with pepper. Let rise uncovered in warm place 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 400F. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with additional oil. Serve warm.

*If using quick-acting yeast, omit first rise. After kneading, cover dough and let rest 10 minutes. Press dough in pan and continue as directed.

High altitude directions (3500 to 6500 feet): Rising times may be slightly shorter.

FOCACCIA: flat Italian bread with a pebbly, dimpled top; may be plain or made with herbs, onions, or olives.

FOUGASSE: a low, lattice-cut loaf originally made in the south of France and sometimes studded with Mediterranean ingredients like anchovies or olives.

SEMOLINA BREAD: usually made with unbleached all-purpose flour and finely ground, unbleached patent durum flour, which gives the bread its characteristic pale-yellow color.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast
  3               cups  all purpose flour -- (3 to 4)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- melted
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  red and green candied cherries -- chopped
     1/4           cup  nuts -- chopped (optional)
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
                        -- 1 20 X 1 1/2 inch brown paper or
                        aluminum foil strip
                        -- 1 15 X 1 1/2 inch brown paper or
                        aluminum foil strip
                        -- 1 1/2 inch wide holiday ribbon

Place yeast in warm water and set aside. Mix together 1 cup flour, sugar and salt. Add milk,melted butter and eggs and mix well. Stir in yeast mixture. Continue adding flour until a nice soft dough forms. Remove dough from bowl and knead in raisins, candied cherries and nuts. Place in a greased bowl until double in size, approximately one hour. Punch down dough and shape into a 8 X 5 inch rectangle.

Grease a baking sheet. Using the 1 tablespoon of butter, grease the brown paper strips well on all sides. Place strips on the cookie sheet, perpendicular to each other, making a cross shape. Center the rectangular shaped dough over the strips. Loosely wrap the strips around the dough and secure with paper clips. Make sure you can fit two fingers under the strips. Let dough rise 1/2 hour. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool and remove paper strips. Wrap with holiday ribbon in the indentions and the bread will resemble a gift package. Bread can also be baked omitting the paper strips and frosted with a drizzle of powdered sugar icing. Makes one loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  oil
     1/4           cup  lecithin

About 12 years ago I took some classes from a lady in the San Jose area on bread baking. She gave us the "recipe" for a liquid Pam which is 1 part liquid lecithin to 2 parts oil. I have used it for many years in my bread pans - you just wipe out the pan after you take the bread out and there's no need to wash in between. The bread just slips out. I use it for cakes/muffins/casseroles/ anywhere I'm baking and it works wonderfully. A couple of cautions. Liquid lecithin is very hard to clean so use a plastic honey bottle or something like that to make your "Pam" in. You don't want the bottle to break on your floor and have to clean it up! It will also turn rancid after time so make up maybe a 1/4 c. lecithin and 1/2 c. oil. (Don't measure - just eye-ball). To clean the container between mixes, use dishwasher soap - it's the only stuff that will cut the lecithin. I let it soak for a while and it comes pretty clean.

I've had no trouble finding liquid lecithin at health food stores. On the bottle it will tell you to use 2 parts lecithin to 1 part oil...They just want to sell more lecithin.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- double if preferred
  3        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  1                     dried ancho pepper, or Anaheim
  2        tablespoons  grated parmesan cheese -- fresh
  1                cup  milk

Preheat oven to 450F.

Remove the stems and seeds from a large ancho pepper. Soak the pepper in 1 cup boiling water for 20-30 minutes.

Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Add shortening, and cut into mixture with a table knife. Add grated cheese and stir to combine. Drain the pepper and cut into slender short strips. (Sharp kitchen scissors work well.) Add milk and pepper to the dry ingredients, and stir lightly and quickly to combine.

Roll our the dough on a well-floured surface to about a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into small rounds or fanciful shapes with a biscuit/cookie cutter, and place on on ungreased, nonstick cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until tops are lighhy browned.

Serve immediately with butter and hot pepper jelly. These hot biscuits are delightful with roasted meats. Store leftover biscuits in a plastic bag; they're great split, buttered, and toasted under the broiler and served with soup or salad. Makes 2 dozen biscuits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        The Sponge (begin the night before):
  1                cup  water -- chlorine-free
     1/4      teaspoon  instant yeast
  1 1/4           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour
  2        tablespoons  King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat
                        Flour
  1         tablespoon  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  semolina flour
                        ---
                        Bread:
  1                cup  water -- chlorine-free
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  instant yeast
  3 1/2           cups  King Arthur Special For Machines Bread
                        Flour

First my comments, then the recipe.
I'm not sure how to make water chlorine-free, or why it's important. I boiled the water for the sponge, then measured the remaining water and let it sit overnight. Read the whole recipe, including suggestions, before you start. You just leave the sponge in the machine overnight, then add the remaining ingredients. I used 1 Tbsp each of whole wheat and rye, instead of 2 Tbsp whole wheat. I used 1 1/4 C water the next day instead of 1 (they suggest up to 1 1/2, but the dough is very wet and sticky). I used regular yeast. I also used regular salt, but only about 1/2 Tbsp, since kosher salt contains huge crystals, and 1 Tbsp must contain less salt mass than 1 Tbsp regular. Note that this recipe contains no added fat. Note their suggestion for storing the bread. This is something that was suggested earlier on the bread list as well. Simply leave the loaf on the countertop, cut side down. This actually works. It stays crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.

---
The Sponge (begin the night before):
1 cup water, chlorine-free
1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
1 1/4 cups King Arthur Special For Machines Bread Flour
2 tablespoons King Arthur Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour
1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal
1 tablespoon semolina flour

Place the ingredients in the pan of your bread machine and program for Manual or Dough. Press Start. After several minutes, or once the dough is fully mixed -- it'll look like thick pudding -- cancel the machine. [Leave sponge in the machine.]

The Next Day  (or about 8 hours later) stir down the sponge. Continue to
make the dough by adding the following:

1 cup water, chlorine-free
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
3 1/2 cups King Arthur Special For Machines Bread Flour

Program your machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start. As the dough begins to mix it should form first a soft mass, then eventually a soft ball that is not too stiff, but not sticky, either. Adjust with additional flour or water as necessary. (If the dough isn't coming together, stop the machine, and stir the dough with a rubber spatula to help the sponge and added ingredients combine. Re-program the machine for Dough, and start it again.)

When the cycle is complete, remove the dough from the machine. (It can hang around for a bit -- you don't have to rush.) Cover with a tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes. (If you want to leave the dough all day, place it in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and refrigerate it. When you're ready to work with it, deflate if necessary, and allow to warm slightly before proceeding.)

After its rest period, deflate the dough gently and form it into a round ball, Place the ball, seam-side down, on a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet. Cover it lightly with a tea towel. Let it rise a second time until it's puffy and about 30% to 40% larger, about 1 hour. Don't let it rise too much, since it rises some more in the oven and, if it's overproofed initially, it'll collapse as it bakes.

Preheat the oven to 475F. Make several 1/4- to 1/2-inch slashes or crosshatches in the loaf. If your dough deflates at this point, it means it rose too much. But even if it does topple a bit or deflate, generally the heat of the oven will help it spring back. [I find that my bread knife makes the best slashes.]

Using a clean plant mister, spritz the loaf with water. Spray some water into the oven, and place the bread on the lowest rack.

Spritz the oven walls every few minutes for the first 15 minutes of baking. Lower the heat to 425F (this reduction in heat mimics the "falling oven" used by brick-oven bakers, and will give your bread an incredible crust), and continue to bake until well-browned, about 35 minutes. The interior temperature of the bread should register 190F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a wire rack before slicing. Store, cut side down, on a counter (do not cover). Yes, this really works; your bread will remain fresh but not soggy for several days. Yield: One large loaf, about 24 hearty servings.

Additional Notes:

You may use 2 tablespoons pumpernickel, the grain French bakers traditionally add to enhance a bread's keeping qualities, in place of the whole wheat flour in the initial sponge.

For an even chewier bread with larger, more irregular holes, try increasing the amount of water in the dough's second stage by 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Add 1/4 cup initially, then take a look at the dough while it's in its second kneading cycle. Your goal is to create a dough which is very wet and slack, but which will still hold its shape when formed into a freeform loaf. Add additional water if it looks as though the dough can absorb it and still remain firm enough to be workable.

This bread is an ideal candidate for a linen-lined banneton, which will hold and shape it as it rises and, because of the moisture-drawing qualities of the linen, help produce a chewy crust.

Try putting your risen loaf into the oven without slashing it first; it'll develop its own natural split, producing a more rustic-looking loaf.

For a thick, brown, chewy bottom crust, try baking the bread in the oven in a preheated cast iron skillet, or on a baking stone.

For a crisper crust, allow the loaf to cool in the oven. When the bread is done, turn off the oven and crack the door open a couple of inches, leaving the loaf inside.

Just a Hint.... Store crusty hearth loaves uncovered, but with their cut side down on the counter. This is one of the best tips we've come across in some time. Though this doesn't work on baguettes, rolls, or other small loaves, it works beautifully on big boules or freeform loaves. The moisture in the bread's interior gradually migrates to the surface, but since the cut side is covered, it can't escape there; instead, it must navigate its way through the thick crust, a much slower process. This keeps the bread's interior soft, and the crust hard and crunchy.

NOTES : We have just finished off our second loaf. It's wonderful!

It is FABULOUS! Words can't describe how wonderful it is, how crusty and chewy, with holes in it. Exactly like what my son buys in a Seattle bakery. Very easy to make, too. Mix the sponge in the breadmaker, unplug and leave it overnight. Next day add the remaining ingredients and set on dough cycle. Then form the loaf by hand, let rise, and bake in the oven. By the way, the dough is quite wet and sticky, and might be hard to knead by hand.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  luke warm milk
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  mashed potatoes -- finely mashed or
                        whipped
  2 1/4           cups  flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  mace
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yeast
                        -- (bread machine or rapid rise)
     1/2           cup  dried currants
  3        tablespoons  margarine or butter

BREAD MACHINE METHOD: Follow bread machine manufacturer's directions for adding of ingredients - or, place ingredients in machine in the order listed. Make a dimple in center of flour and sugar mixture (not down to the milk) and place yeast in dimple. Set bread machine on white or regular mix and light crust, or settings of your choice. For food safety purposes - DO NOT use delayed start setting. Start bread cycle immediately.

HAND METHOD: Sprinkle yeast on top of milk. Add egg, potatoes, sugar, salt, mace, currants, butter, and about 1 1/2 cups flour. Beat well by hand. Gradually stir in enough more flour to make a soft dough, but one which may be kneaded by hand. Place dough on flour surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Place in clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover, and allow to rise until double in bulk.

Punch down, or knead out air. Shape into rolls or place in greased 9 inch round cake pan. Cover and allow to rise until double in bulk. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown and it sounds hollow when thumped. Remove from oven and brush surface with butter.

                        -- 1 Lb Loaf:
     3/8          cups  To 1/2 C Water
  1                     Egg
  1                Tsp  Anise Extract
  1                Tsp  Rum Extract

     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  2               cups  Bread Flour
  2               Tbsp  Nonfat Dry Milk Powder
  1                Tsp  Anise Seed
  2                Tsp  Active Dry Yeast
  2               Tbsp  Coarsely Chopped Pine Nuts
  2               Tbsp  Golden Raisins
  2               Tbsp  Candied Citron
  2               Tbsp  Candied Orange Peel
  2                Tsp  Bread Flour

Joan Stewart, Linda's supervisor, good naturedly agreed to test this bread time and time again until her Italian taste buds pronounced it close enough to the real thing to be acceptable. True panettone is much drier than
this bread, a texture that is difficult to achieve in a bread machine. But pop a slice of this exquisite bread in your toaster and you'll sweeten your home with the fragrance of anise every morning. Bellissimo

1. Place ingredients in bread pan, except nuts, raisins, citron, candied orange peel, and additional bread flour, using the least amount of liquid listed in the recipe. Select LIGHT CRUST setting and RAISIN/NUT cycle. Press START.

2. Observe the dough as it kneads. After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry and stiff or if your machine sounds as if it's straining to knead it, add more liquid 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly tacky to the touch.

3. In a small bowel, toss together the nuts, raisins, candied fruits, and additional bread flour. Add to the bread pan at the beep.

4. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from the pan, place on a cake rack, and allow to cool for 1 hour before slicing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  All-purpose flour
  1           Teaspoon  Baking powder
     1/8      Teaspoon  Baking soda
     1/4      Teaspoon  Salt
  2        Tablespoons  Cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1           Teaspoon  Chopped jalapeno pepper -- or to taste
     1/4           Cup  Buttermilk -- plus
  1           Teaspoon  Buttermilk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment or wax paper.
Into a bowl sift dry ingredients. Cut in butter with a fork or your fingers, until mixture is crumbly. Stir in pepper, to taste. Add just enough buttermilk, a little at a time, for mixture to come together into a smooth ball of dough. Do not overwork or over handle dough. On lightly-floured work surface, roll out dough into a 7-inch round, 1/2-inch thick. Using a 1-inch cookie cutter, press out 12 rounds. Reroll scraps to make additional biscuits, but these will not be as tender.
Transfer rounds to baking sheet and bake 15 minutes, until tops are golden and bottoms are browned. Serve warm.
This recipe yields 12 biscuits.

Notes: Isn't it great when something that's good for you also tastes delicious! Here's a flavorful bread for guilt-free nibbling. CYCLE: On most machines, this loaf baked up best on the Rapid Bake cycle (anything less than 3 hours). If that's not the case with yours, then switch to the Regular cycle.

NOTES : This recipe gives both measurements for the whole wheat and unbleached flour. You can either use the cups or measure it by the weight.
I have found from experience with this book that the recipes are far more superior if you weigh the flours instead of measuring by the cup. As the book explained, the reason for this is because all flours weigh differently and you do not get the right abouts if measured by cup (ie. wheat flour is a heavyier flour which requires gluten to help it rise. If you used the same amount of a lighter flour it would put too much flour into the recipe and cause it to be too dry among other things.) I use a small digital scale when I measure my flours.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  lukewarm water
     3/4           cup  millet
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 3/4           cups  bread flour
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  raisins
  1                cup  hot water

2 LOAVES (20 SLICES)       DAIRY-FREE

Millet is a pale-yellow, high-protein grain that is cultivated as a staple in North Africa and Asia, where it has been farmed for at least 6,000 years. In Europe and the United States, it is grown mostly for animal feed, but it is available for your baking needs in natural food stores.

Combine 1 1/2 cups water and millet in bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer or in large bowl. Let sit for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow millet to soften.

Stir in honey. Sprinkle yeast over mixture, stir and let sit 2 minutes. Add flours and salt. Mix with dough hook or knead by hand for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is silky and resilient.

Meanwhile, put raisins in small bowl, add hot water and let stand until plump, about 10 minutes.

Drain raisins and mix or knead them into the dough until thoroughly incorporated. Transfer dough to lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 'A hours. Punch dough down, re-cover with plastic wrap and let rise again 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 F. Grease two 8-by 4-inch loaf pans or generously dust baking sheet with whole wheat flour. Place dough on lightly floured work surface and cut into 2 equal pieces. Shape dough into oblong loaves. Alternatively, shape it into 2 loaves or 14 to 16 rolls. Place loaves in prepared pan or on baking sheet. Cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rise in warm place 20 minutes. Uncover loaves and, using a spray bottle, spritz them with water and dust with whole wheat flour. Make 2 or 3 diagonal slashes in tops of loaves with serrated knife. Using a spray bottle, spritz the oven walls with water. Work quickly so oven does not lose heat.

Set pans or baking sheet on middle rack in oven. Bake 35 to 40 minutes (20 to 25 minutes for rolls). The bread is done when the crust is dark and firm and the loaves sound hollow when their bottoms are tapped. Let bread cool in the pan or on baking sheet for 10 minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack and let cool completely.

Bread Machine Instructions 1. Combine ingredients in bread pan in order specified by manufacturer's instructions. 2. Process on whole wheat medium setting.

NOTES : Here's what I make instead of fruitcake during the Holidays.  There may be others, like me who don't care for fruitcake.

For all those of us, who don't care for the traditional holiday fruitcake. This is a great alternative.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***MOCK PUFF DOUGH***
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- cut into chunks
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1                     egg
                        ***FILLING***
  1              pound  dry cottage cheese
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- may be tripled
  1              pinch  salt
                        squirt lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  flour

For dough, place flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in food processor. Pulse to blend. Add butter chunks and pulse to cut fat into flour. Add sour cream and egg and process to form a soft dough. Wrap dough and chill about 20 minutes.

For filling, blend ingredients and chill for ten minutes.

To form cheese bagels, divide dough in half. Roll out, on a lightly floured board to an oblong 1/4 inch thick. Place half of filling along one edge. Roll halfway, then cut the roll you have formed away from the remaining body of the dough. Repeat. Cut into 8 inch lengths and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Curve rolls into horse shoe shapes, pinching ends together to seal a bit.

Brush (if desired) with beaten egg and sprinkle very lightly with fine sugar.

Bake at 350 F. for about 40 minutes or until lightly browned. Makes about a dozen bagels. Freezes well. Can be made in miniature form. Serve hot with sour cream. [338 cals, 17g fat (45%cff)]

PANTRY: dry cottage cheese (in U.S.) also known as hoop or baker's cheese or no-curd, dry cottage cheese

Notes: This dough is flaky and delicate. If you are in a hurry, substitute store-bought puff pasty dough. This recipe is similar to the one by Montreal Jewish cooking maven and author, Norene Gilletz. Her book, Second Helpings is a part of many kitchen librairies in these parts.

I've been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks I should "go public" with this recipe! It's for a bread machine, but you could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my Zojirushi machine the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so other machines   may need a light crust setting.
Enjoy!

Place ingred. in B/M in order given (start at bottom for>>>> Welbilt/Dak) set crust to light and bake on white bread setting. I'm munching on the "heel" as I type and am thinking about how good a sandwich
will be in a few hours! Maybe next time I'll add pepperoni and have all the sandwich ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza taste!

For best results, all ingredients should be at room temperature (70 to 80F). Measure ingredients into bread pan in the order suggested in your owner's manual. Select the Whole Wheat or Basic setting. Press Start. When machine signals that bread is done, press Stop; remove bread from pan. Cool on wire rack. Makes a 1-1/2 pound loaf.

*7-grain and 10-grain cereals can be found in health food stores as well as in the health food sections of major supermarkets. Hint: If your breadmaker does not have a whole wheat setting, use the basic or normal setting. Allow machine to mix and knead for 15 minutes; press Stop and then press Start again. The extra kneading will produce a better structure.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  uncooked multigrain cereal -- such as
                        Bob's Red Mill 8-Grain Wheat-Free
                        or 10-Grain cereal
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace -- generous
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
     2/3           cup  packed brown sugar
  1                     egg
  1                cup  dried cranberries -- see note
                        Raw sugar
                        or coarse-grained colored sugar -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Generously grease 12 large (2-3/4-inch) muffin cups.

In a large microsafe measure, heat milk and oil until very warm, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir in multigrain cereal; let stand 10 to 15 minutes.

In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking powder and mace.

Stir vanilla, brown sugar and egg into cereal mixture. Add to flour mixture; stir until almost moistened. Stir in cranberries, but do not overbeat.

Scoop into muffin tins. Sprinkle with raw or colored sugar. Bake in lower third of oven for 15 minutes or until done. Let cool in pans for 5 to 8 minutes, then remove to racks to cool completely.

Yield: 12 muffins.

Note: If using fresh or frozen-and-thawed cranberries, use 2 cups cranberries and increase sugar to 1 cup.

To make ahead: Flash-freeze muffins by arranging with space between them on a freezer-safe tray. After freezing about 1 hour, seal in plastic zipper bags. Wrap frozen muffins airtight, with instructions to serve warm.

Caution: Fat helps keep a finished cake or muffin in good shape during the freezing and thawing process. So feel free to try skinny substitutions with these recipes - such as low-fat cream cheese in the great Milky Way pie or egg substitute in the coffee cake - but only if you plan to bake and give these without freezing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              cups.  bread flour -- (4 to 4 1/2)
  3 1/2          cups.  whole-wheat flour
  2       tablespoons.  vital wheat gluten
  1       tablespoons.  grated orange peel
  1 1/2     teaspoons.  salt
     1/2          tsp.  ground ginger
  2              Tbsp.  active dry yeast
                        -- (I use rapid-rise)
  2              cups.  lukewarm milk
     1/2         cups.  lukewarm water -- r minus 2 Tbsp.
  2              Tbsp.  lemon juice
     1/3         cups.  honey
     1/4         cups.  vegetable oil
  1 1/2          cups.  chopped walnuts -- roasted (1 1/2 to 2)
  3       tablespoons.  unsalted butter

Yield:  2 standard-sized loaves (using loaf pans)

(For KithcenAid)

With standard mixing attachment, thoroughly combine first five ingredients into large mixing bowl. Add yeast and combine thoroughly. Add liquids and mix only until dough starts to form a ball -- approximately 10-20 seconds.

Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 7-9 minutes, adding walnuts midway through the kneading process. Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down. Repeat.

Punch down dough; divide into two equal-sized pieces. Form into loaves and place in lightly greased (I use Pam cooking spray) loaf pans. Cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location until dough reaches the top of the loaf pans.

Preheat oven to 500F while dough is rising in loaf pans.

Turn heat down to 375 (or 350 if using convection); immediately uncover loaves and place into oven for 25 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and place back into oven, baking for approximately 15-20 additional minutes, or until crusts are nicely browned and loaves test done. Remove to cooling racks. As soon as loaves are removed from oven, melt butter over low heat and brush lightly over crusts for softer crust.

Allow loaves to cool for at least 60 minutes before slicing. If freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 2 hours).

NOTES : This recipe gives both measurements for the whole wheat and unbleached flour. You can either use the cups or measure it by the weight.
I have found from experience with this book that the recipes are far more superior if you weigh the flours instead of measuring by the cup. As the book explained, the reason for this is because all flours weigh differently and you do not get the right abouts if measured by cup (ie. wheat flour is a heavyier flour which requires gluten to help it rise. If you used the same amount of a lighter flour it would put too much flour into the recipe and cause it to be too dry among other things.) I use a small digital scale when I measure my flours.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Pkg  active dry years
  2               Cups  bread flour
  1                Cup  rye flour
                        -- (I used dark rye from Bob's Red Mill)
  3        Tablespoons  brown sugar
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  charnuska -- (1 1/2 to 2)
                        -- (it's sour -- so judge for
                        yourself)
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  dehydrated onion
                        -- (add an additional 2 tsp water if
                        -- using the higher amount)
     1/2           Tsp  salt
  1         Tablespoon  olive oil
  1                Cup  warm water -- plus
  2        Tablespoons  warm water

I discovered a spice (?) that is now vital to my rye bread. It's called charnuska, and it's described as black caraway. I don't know if it's actually related to caraway, but I do know that I made this recipe last week for a dinner party and my friend Dan, who is from New Jersey and says he loves his Levy's (I understood that reference, which scares me...) said it was the best onion rye he'd had outside of the neighborhood bakery of his youth. Of course, he always was a polite fellow... but it's pretty good rye bread nonetheless...

(I discovered charnuska in the Penzey's catalog. I think they're at http://www.penzeys.com. Dan says he's going to check the Indian specialty store by his house to see if he can get it there in bulk, but Penzey's isn't exactly overpriced...)

(I invented this recipe so I get to name it after myself...<g>)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select a light crust setting, and press "start".

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.


                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : I've found the most aromatic breads to be those with onion in them. An onion bread or herb and onion bread is extremely tantalizing and will have your guests eager to sample it the moment the bread comes out of the machine.

This bread smells so terrific while it's baking that it's hard waiting long enough to let it cool before slicing into it! It's a glorious onion-flavored bread that would make an excellent addition to your next barbeque meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           Cup  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
     1/4           Cup  sugar
     1/4           Cup  brown sugar -- packed
  2              Large  eggs
     1/2           Cup  orange juice
     1/2      Teaspoon  vanilla
  2        Tablespoons  grated orange zest
  2               Cups  all-purpose flour
  2          Teaspoons  baking powder

                        Confectioners sugar -- for serving
                        Cranberry butter -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 350/. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and both sugars together with an electric mixer. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then mix in the orange juice, vanilla, and orange zest. Add the flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest, and vanilla and mix together well. Generously butter and flour a 10inch bundt pan and scoop the batter into it, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the sides shrink away from the pan and the center of the loaf springs back. Cool the pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a round platter. Sprinkle a little confectioners sugar over the top of the bread and serve warm or at room temperature, accompanied by small pots of cranberry butter.


Yield: One 10inch bundt bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  nonfat vanilla yogurt
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger root
  1         tablespoon  grated orange rind

Use Non-fat Vanilla Yogurt (the old fashioned kind with no gelatin that will "cheese up"), I like the quart size. Add one teaspoon (or less depending on your love of ginger) of grated ginger, and about one tablespoon of finely grated orange rind. Stir all of this together, fill your colander with paper towels, and plop the yogurt mix into it, set it over a bowl and refrigerate it for about 24 hours. It will turn into a fragrant and delicious orange/ginger flavored spreadable cheese that is wonderful on whole wheat toast or ww crackers. If you use a smaller size yogurt, just reduce the orange and ginger according to your own guesses!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               cups  Pancake Mix -- Or More As Nec
     1/2           Cup  Nonfat Milk -- Or
                        Water
     1/2           Cup  orange juice
  4                     egg whites
  1           Teaspoon  orange extract
                        orange grind if you like
                        Pam spray

Just mix up all the above to the consistency you like for thickness by adding more of the pancake mix - I like a really crepe style pancake so I can roll them and fill them with All Fruit and lemon juice or low salt fat-free pie fillings (Pet Cherry) and top them with the low or no-fat version of Cool Whip - - This makes an awesome desert. The orange flavor combined with the spongy quality of the cakes due to the egg whites is really a wonderful treat.

You can adapt this recipe to French toast too. Just mix together the egg whites and the orange juice and orange extract, plus add some cinnamon. It is especially good when using a heavy whole grain breads, heavy breads or fruit bread that's gone stale.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        **DOUGH:**
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  honey
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 2/3           cups  wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  cocoa
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  instant coffee
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4      teaspoons  yeast -- (1 pkg.)
                        **COLORING:**
     1/4           cup  water
  75             drops  red food coloring
  45             drops  blue food coloring
  30             drops  yellow food coloring
                        cornmeal for dusting

1. If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough in the exact order listed into the pan of your machine. Set it on "knead" and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the food coloring with 1/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as it combines. After the dough is created let it rest to rise for an hour or so. Then remove it from the pan and go to step #3.

2. If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar, coffee and salt in large bowl. Make a depression or "well" in the middle of the dry mixture. Pour the warm water into this "well," then add the butter, honey and yeast. Combine the food coloring drops with 1/4 cup of water and add that to the "well." Slowly mix the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into the wet. When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand, kneading the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is very smooth and has a consistent color. Set the dough into a covered bowl in a warm place for an hour, to allow it to rise.

3. When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and divide it into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those halves in half, and then once more). Form the portions into tubular shaped loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. Sprinkle the entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie sheet, or two. Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic wrap and let the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location.

4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Uncover the dough and bake it for 20-24 minutes in the hot oven. Loaves should begin to darken slightly on top when done. Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter on the side. If you want whipped butter, like you get at the restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high speed to whip some butter until it's fluffy.

Makes 8 small loaves.

  1            Package  active dry yeast -- or
  1                     Cake Of Compressed Yeast
  1                Cup  milk -- scalded and cooled
                        -- to lukewarm
     1/4           Cup  sugar
  3 1/4           Cups  sifted flour
     1/3           Cup  peanut butter
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt

Make a sponge as follow: Crumble yeast into milk, add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and stir in 1 cup of flour. Cover bowl and set aside in a warm place (about 85F.) until the sponge is light and full of bubbles.

Mix together peanut butter, egg, the rest of the sugar, and salt. Add to the sponge. Stir in the rest of the flour and mix until the dough follows the spoon around the bowl. Turn dough onto a lightly floured board, knead until smooth and elastic, and place in a clean greased bowl.

Grease surface of dough by turning it over in the bowl several times. Cover bowl. Let dough rise in a warm place until double in size. Punch down and let rise a second time. Punch down a second time; mold into a loaf and place in a greased baking pan (8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches). Let loaf rise in a warm place until double in size. Bake at 375F. (moderate oven) about 30 minutes or until the bread is well browned. Cool before serving.

SWEET BUNS:
Mix the dough and let rise twice as above; turn onto a floured board and roll very thin. Spread with softened butter or margarine, sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and chopped peanuts. Roll as for jelly roll and cut in inch slices. Blend 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup butter or margarine and spread on bottom and sides of baking pan. Place slices of roll flat in pan and let rise at 85 F. until double in size. Bake at 425F. (hot oven) 25 minutes. Remove from pan at once.

NOTES : I want to share this GREAT traditional recipe with everyone! if u're bored with plain dinner rolls or sweet buns, u gotta try this "pineapple" buns, actually a variation to your sweet bun recipe!

"Pineapple" buns, a Chinesenized version of western dinner rolls, is a famous specialty in bakeries in Hong Kong. They're actually sweet breads with exotic fillings or variations.

Here's a recipe for "pineapple" buns. It's so-called not because it's made from pineapple, instead they LOOK LIKE the surface of pineapple!

NOTE: you can use your own sweet breads recipe which makes 12 buns [i have just posted my own recipe as follows just in case]. After 2 rises and punch downs, shape them into round buns of 2 oz each.

                Daily Bread Mailing List        Hand Made
                International Breads            Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  warm water
                        -- (approximately 105 degrees F)
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- About
                        -- or bread flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- (1 to 2)

You will need a large bread bowl, a rolling pin, and unglazed quarry tiles or several baking sheets, or alternatively a cast iron or other heavy skillet or griddle at least 9 inches in diameter.

Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a large bread bowl. Stir to dissolve. Add whole wheat flour, one cup at a time, then 1 cup white flour. Stir 100 times (one minute) in the same direction to activate the gluten in the flour. Let this sponge rest for at least 10 minutes or as long as 2 hours.

Sprinkle salt over the sponge and stir in the olive oil. Mix well. Add 2 cups white flour, one cup at a time. When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn it out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. Return the dough to a lightly oiled bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until at least double in size, approximately 1 1/2 hours. Gently punch down. Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 5 days or less.

If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for baking later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three times the size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it just at the opening of the bag. This will give the dough a chance to expand when it is in the refrigerator (which it will do). From day to day, simply cut off the amount of dough you need and keep the rest in the refrigerator, for up to one week. The dough will smell slightly fermented after a few days, but this simply improves the taste of the bread. Dough should be brought to room temperature before baking.

This amount of dough will make approximately 16 pitas if rolled out into circles approximately 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch thick. You can also of course make smaller breads. Size and shape all depend on you, but for breads of this dimension the following baking tips apply:

Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one inch gap all around to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while you work with the rest. Divide dough into eight equal pieces and flatten each piece with lightly floured hands. Roll out each piece to a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter. You may wish to roll out all eight before starting to bake. Cover rolled out breads, but do not stack.

Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is larger) directly on quarry tiles or baking sheets. Bake each bread for 3 or 4 minutes, until the bread has gone into a full "balloon" or until it is starting to turn lightly golden, whichever happens first. If there are seams or dry bits of dough - or for a variety of other reasons - your bread may not go into a full "balloon". Don't worry, it will still taste great. The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with all the little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more consistently "balloon." But even then, if you're like us, it won't always "balloon" fully and you won't mind because the taste will still be wonderful. When baked, remove, place on a rack for about five minutes to let cool slightly, then wrap breads in a large kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft). When first half of the dough has been rolled out and baked, repeat for rest of dough, or store in refrigerator for later use, as described above. You can also divide the dough into more, smaller pieces if you wish, to give you smaller breads.

Yield : 16 pitas about 8 inches in diameter, or more smaller breads.

                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

WHAT YOU NEED
Makes 1 large plaited loaf

PREPARATION 20 MINUTES PLUS 1 HOUR 10 MINUTES RISING
BAKING 30 MINUTES

600g/1lb 5oz strong white bread flour,  unbleached if possible, plus extra
50g/2oz butter, at room temperature, cut in pieces, plus extra for greasing
7g sachet easy-blend yeast
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar
400ml/14fl oz milk
FOR THE GLAZE
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp milk

STEP 1 MIX THE DOUGH
Put the flour and butter in a bowl and rub between your fingers to make fine crumbs. Stir in the yeast, salt and sugar. Warm the milk to bloodheat (this takes about 50-60 seconds in the microwave). Pour the warm milk into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to make a soft dough, gathering in all the dry bits. The dough should feel damp, but not wet or dry. Flour varies so hold back the last three tablespoons and only add if the dough feels dry to the fingers.


STEP 2 KNEAD THE DOUGH
Shape the dough into a ball and put on the work surface. Knead for about 10 minutes until smooth, shiny, and elastic, sprinkling on a little flour as you knead - add flour sparingly or the dough will get too dry. The dough needs more flour when it feels sticky on the surface. No more flour is needed when the dough is no longer sticky but is smooth and silky. To check if the dough is ready, you can do the "bubblegum test": pull off a small piece of dough, then stretch it from either end. If it tears, knead a bit longer; if it doesn't tear and it looks like bubblegum you could blow a bubble through, it's ready.

STEP 3 RISE THE DOUGH
Put the dough in a large clean bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to rise for about 40 minutes or until doubled in size (this will depend on the temperature of the room). On a cold dry day, the dough may take at least an extra 30 minutes to rise than on a warm humid day. The slower the dough rises the more the flavour and texture will develop. If the dough is left to rise in a medium-sized glass bowl, the dough should almost fill the bowl when risen sufficiently. You can also test if the dough is risen enough by pressing the dough gently with a fingertip. When ready, the indentation will spring back slowly; otherwise it springs back at once. Be careful not to let it overrise at this stage. Lift the dough from the bowl and knead briefly to knock out the air bubbles.


STEP 4 SHAPE THE PLAIT
Grease a baking sheet. Divide the dough into three equal pieces. Roll out each piece with your hands to form a 30cm/12in long rope. Lay in parallel lines, slightly apart. Start from the centre of the ropes and plait towards yourself, working from left to right. Continue plaiting the ropes until you reach the end. Press the ends together with your fingers and tuck them neatly under the bottom of the loaf. Turn the shaped dough around so the unplaited end is now facing you. Again, working from the centre, plait the ropes from left to right until you reach the end. Press the ends together and tuck neatly under the bottom loaf to finish. Put on the baking sheet and cover with a tea towel. Leave to rise (also known as proving) for 30 minutes or until it looks risen and puffy. Test by pressing the dough lightly with a fingertip. It should feel spongy, not firm. Preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6/for fan ovens cook from cold at 180C.


STEP 5 BAKE THE LOAF
Mix together the egg yolk and milk, then brush the top of the loaf with some of the glaze, brushing well in between all the plaiting. Bake for 20 minutes. Brush again with the glaze, then bake for a further 10 minutes until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.

HOW LONG WILL IT KEEP?
The loaf will keep for up to 3 days. Or leave it to cool, then wrap in plastic wrap and a polythene bag, and freeze for up to 3 months.


MORE FLAVOURS AND SHAPES

EMMENTAL AND PROSCIUTTO LOAF
Good on its own or for lunchtime sandwiches.
At the end of step 3, flatten out the dough to an 18cm/7in circle. Scatter 50g/2oz diced prosciutto and 50g/2oz Emmental (or Gruyere) over the dough. Gather the dough around the filling, then knead by cutting the dough with a sharp knife as you knead, which helps to evenly distribute. Roll out with your hands in to a 63cm/25in rope. Bend in half and twist together to form a rope. Tuck under the ends and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover with a tea towel and leave to rise for 30 minutes. Brush with egg and milk glaze (see glazes) and sprinkle with a little grated Emmental. Bake for 30 minutes.

ROSEMARY AND RAISIN LOAF
Great with cheese, especially goat's cheese.
At the end of step 3, make a slight well in the middle of the dough and sprinkle over 1 tbsp roughly chopped fresh rosemary and 100g/4oz raisins. Knead into the dough and cut the dough with a sharp knife as you knead - this helps to evenly distribute. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Shape into rolls and place in a 23 x 4.5cm/9 x 13/4in round greased tin (eight round the edge, four in the middle). Cover with a clean tea towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Brush with an egg and milk glaze (see glazes) and sprinkle with extra rosemary. Bake for 30 minutes.

FIG, ALMOND AND ORANGE LOAF
Lovely for breakfast.
Mix together 85g/3oz roughly chopped toasted almonds, 250g/9oz chopped ready-to-eat dried figs, and the finely grated rind of 2 oranges. At the end of step 3, roll the dough out to a 33 X 20cm/13 x 8in rectangle and scatter over half the fig mixture. Fold in three by bringing both ends into the middle, then folding again. Press the edges with a rolling pin to seal, then roll again and sprinkle over the remaining filling. Fold in three again, then knead the dough to evenly distribute the filling. Roll the dough with your hands into a 63cm/25in rope. Roll up into a spiral and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover with a clean tea towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Brush with an egg and salt glaze (see glazes) and bake for 35-40 minutes. Check after 20 minutes - if the bread is browning too quickly, lay a piece of foil over the top. Cool slightly, then sift with a generous dusting of icing sugar.

DIFFERENT GLAZE EFFECTS
High sheen - mix 1 egg yolk with 1/4 tsp salt
Golden - mix 1 egg yolk with 1 tbsp milk
Rustic - sprinkle the shaped risen dough with flour
Crisp and crusty - brush with lightly salted water

                        Approximate measurements are:
  2               cups  flour
                        -- (can be white or whole - unbleached)
  1 1/4            cup  liquid
                        -- (generally water but can be milk- etc.)
  2          teaspoons  regular yeast

Mix well and knead - should be roughly the thickness of a pancake batter. Cover and let stand for at least 2 or 3 hours at 70 to 75 degrees F. Can easily go overnight if water is the base liquid, though I wouldn't do it that long with milk.

After this, when ready to make the dough, add the salt and mix in. Then add any other ingredients (other than flour) and incorporate. Only now add the balance of the flour and finish making the dough as you normally would.

Let rise one more time to double. Then knead and form the dough, let rise and bake as you normally would.

This is not a sourdough. However, I find the liquidity of the poolish batter results in much better yeast activity and vastly improved flavor compared to making a stiff dough to start with.

NOTES : One of my favorite techniques in bread baking is to start with a "poolish." This is a French term for a starter made of only flour, water and yeast, kneaded well with the paddle blade on a KA or similar mixing method.

  1            package  active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  warm water
  2 3/4           cups  unbleached white flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                cup  mashed high-starch potatoes
                        such as russet--about 3 medium
  2               cups  rye flour
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour -- up to 3
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
                        Coarse cornmeal

MAKES 1 LOAF       DAIRY-FREE

Potatoes make this dense, hearty bread uncommonly light and moist.

In large mixing bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon yeast and 1/2 cup warm water. Let sit until yeast dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in 3/4 cup white flour, cover with plastic wrap and set aside 2 hours.

Gently stir in remaining 2 cups water, remaining 1/2 teaspoon yeast, remaining white flour and salt. Add mashed potatoes, rye flour and wheat flour, incorporating flours 1 cup at a time until you have a dough that is soft and pliable, but firm enough to handle.

If you're kneading by hand, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. (It helps to moisten your hands while you knead.) If you're using an electric mixer with a dough hook, knead by machine until dough pulls away from bowl and forms a ball around the hook.

Add additional flour only if absolutely necessary to prevent sticking. Let dough rest while you wash out mixing bowl. Lightly oil mixing bowl, place dough in bowl and turn over to coat both sides with oil. Cover with kitchen towel; set aside until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 425 F. Punch down dough and knead lightly to press out air. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Sprinkle dough with caraway seeds and knead until dough is elastic and seeds are well distributed, about 4 minutes. Shape dough into round loaf about 9 inches in diameter; place on baking sheet dusted with cornmeal. Cover with kitchen towel and let rise about 40 minutes. Slash an "X" into top of loaf with sharp knife.

Bake until top is browned and bread sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, about 1 hour. Cool on wire rack about 15 minutes before slicing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                Cup  canned pumpkin -- (NOT pie filling)
     2/3           Cup  Skim Milk -- Or
                        Other Liquid
  1 1/2           Cups  flour -- (half white, half
                        -- WW)
  2        Tablespoons  wheat germ
  2        Tablespoons  wheat bran
  4          Teaspoons  baking powder
  1              Clove  garlic -- minced
  1              Pinch  nutmeg
  1           Teaspoon  salt -- (optional)

Combine wet, combine dry, mix wet into dry, drop by generous spoonfuls onto baking sheet squirted with PAM. Bake 20-30 minutes at 450F.

The garlic doesn't really give these a pronounced garlic flavor--it just eliminates some of the cloying sweetness of the pumpkin. When these first come out of the oven they are very crisp on the outside and dense and moist on the inside--sort of like little mini-spoonbreads. After they cook the texture becomes more uniform and more like the standard biscuit we all know and love.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  Granulated Sugar
  3 1/2           cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  2                Tsp  Baking Soda
  1                Tsp  Cinnamon
  1                Tsp  Nutmeg
  4                 Lg  Eggs
  1               cups  Vegetable Oil
  2               cups  Pumpkin -- Cooked
     2/3          cups  Water
  1 1/2           cups  Walnuts -- Chopped
                        Cream Cheese -- Optional
                        For Serving

Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter your containers well.

Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and add the eggs, oil, pumpkin and water. Beat thoroughly. It's easier to get all the lumps out if you use an electric mixer. Stir in the walnuts with a wooden spoon.

Pour the batter into the containers, filling each only half to two-thirds full. Bake for 60-90 minutes, depending on the sizes of your containers. If you're using a very small container, start checking much sooner. The bread is done when a toothpick in the middle comes out clean.

Cool about ten minutes, then loosen the edges of the bread with a knife, and turn out of the pans to cool the rest of the way on a rack. For baking containers, you can use a loaf pan, metal cans, or whatever. I usually use 1-pound coffee cans, and it takes three of them. If you want tiny loaves, you could probably use soup cans.

NOTES:

* A dessert bread made from pumpkins -- Every year in Half Moon Bay, California there is a Pumpkin Festival, at which prizes are given for the largest pumpkin in the world. Never mind that for the last two years the winner has been in Nova Scotia: the citizens of Half Moon Bay take pumpkins very seriously.

At Christmas time in Half Moon Bay, people give each other little tins of this bread as presents. I also take it backpacking, because it's pretty resistant to being squashed (and tastes fine even when it is).

Yield: 3 -- 1-pound loaves.

* I think the nuts are important in this recipe. Unless you absolutely hate them, leave them in.

* It's not necessary, but you can serve some good cream cheese with it to spread on the slices if you like.

  1                Cup  milk
     1/4           Cup  butter or margarine
     1/4         Ounce  active dry yeast -- (1 package)
  3 1/2           Cups  all purpose flour -- up to 4
     1/4           Cup  sugar
  1                     egg

     1/2           Cup  butter or margarine -- melted
     1/2           Cup  golden raisins

In 1 quart saucepan scald milk; stir in 1/4 cup butter until melted. Cool to warm (105 to 115F). In large mixer bowl dissolve yeast in warm water. Add cooled milk mixture, 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, egg and salt. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until smooth (1 to 2 minutes). By hand, stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Place in greased bowl, turn greased side up.

Cover; let rise in warm place until double in size (about 1 1/2 hour). Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.

Punch down dough; divide in half. With floured hands shape each half into 24 balls. In small bowl stir together 1 cup sugar, pecans and cinnamon. Dip balls first into melted butter, then in sugar mixture. Place 24 balls in bottom of greased 10" tube pan or Bundt pan. (If removable bottom tube pan, line with aluminum foil.) Sprinkle with raisins. Top with remaining 24 balls.

Cover; let rise until double in size (about 45 minutes). Heat oven to 350F. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until coffee cake sounds hollow when tapped. (Cover with aluminum foil if coffee cake browns too quickly.) Immediately invert pan on heat-proof serving plate. Let pan stand 1 minute to allow sugar mixture to drizzle over cake. Remove pan; serve warm.

*Can also be made with two loaves of thawed frozen bread dough

  1 1/3           cups  filtered water
     1/4           cup  instant skim milk powder -- (Pacific brand)
  2              Tbsp.  margarine -- (Becel)

                        Add ingredients:  (see below)
  1                cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts

* Millstream is Canadian flour. The original recipe calls for 4-1/4 cups American flour. U.S. bakers might have to add a little extra water to get the desired level of moistness in the finished loaf. Try 1/2 Tbsp. extra to start, if necessary.

Place in breadmaker, select 'Sweet Bread' setting, 'Regular Crust' & start  machine.

Special instructions:
Place 1-2 cups raisins on a large plate and select them one by one into the measuring cup. This may seem fussy, but these raisins tend to stick together right out of the package, and a small percentage still have stems attached. The major departure from the instructions is the way I add the walnuts & raisins. I start to add the walnuts and raisins approx. 10 min. before the machine 'beeps', but not all at once. Add them evenly at one minute intervals over the 10 minutes, and by the time the machine 'beeps' all the raisins & walnuts have been added. Doing it this way seems to avoid excessive mashing by the paddle, and increases distribution. Time: 3hrs. 50 min. in my machine.

NOTES : The following is adapted from the 'Black & Decker Automatic Breadmaker' manual that comes with the machine. I have found some of their recipes tend to be quite conservative with ingredients, and quantities can easily be increased to make a superior loaf, in my opinion. The original version does not call for walnuts, but they bake well in raisin bread. What follows is the exact process/ingredients used to make a moist loaf. I rarely toast this; simply warming a slice for 3 minutes on power level 3 in my microwave returns that 'just baked' effect. This produces a very nice loaf at my elevation. (sea level) Suitable for a 1-1/2 or 2 pound machine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Starter:
  1 1/2           cups  Milk
  2               cups  Rye Flour
  2        tablespoons  Gluten
  2               tsp.  yeast
                        Bread:
  2       tablespoons.  Vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  Molasses
  2       tablespoons.  Unsweetened Cocoa
     1/2          tsp.  Salt
  2               tsp.  Caraway
                        -- or Fennel seed
  1                cup  Whole wheat flour
  1       tablespoons.  Gluten -- (Optional)
  2        tablespoons  Pumpernickel flavor -- (From King Arthur)
  1 1/3            cup  Bread Flour
     3/4           cup  Raisins -- (optional)

Add the starter ingredients to the ABM and let knead for about 10 minutes. Reset the machine (turn it off) and leave the pan in the machine overnight or 6-8 hours.

The next day add the bread ingredients and start machine as usual. If making the loaf in the Machine use the specialty bread setting and add the raisins at the beep. (If you add them to early they get ground up) You can usually find the gluten, rye flour and whole wheat flour in a health food store or you can buy it mail order from King Arthur Flour 800-827-6836

If you are going to make rolls use the dough setting. The raisins are very good in the rolls. Using the dough setting on my Hitachi I add them at the 1:18 mark. When the dough is ready roll out into a flat square. Form into balls the size of a large Lemon. Press down and cover (I put 12 into a 13x9 pan and the rest in a cake pan. Let rise until doubled (1 hour) then cook 20 minutes at 350.

Makes about 15 rolls.

NOTES : You can either make rolls or just leave the dough in the ABM to make a loaf of bread. It must be started the night before. But that is not much of a problem as long as you plan on it. This lets you have the flavor of Pumpernickel sourdough with having to keep a jar of sourdough starter laying around.

  2        tablespoons  Sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Salt
  2          teaspoons  Yeast

This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil for the
margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this technique: Put
all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4 more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp towel and let
it rest for 20 or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again with the damp towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the end of two hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12 hours (the longer the better). Take dough

out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown
and crusty.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  boiling water -- (3)  (4 cups)
                        Poured over:
     1/2           cup  wheat berries -- (3/4)  (1 cup)
                        ---
     1/2           cup  water -- (3/4)  (1 cup)
     1/2          tbsp  sugar -- (3/4)  (1 tbsp)
  2           packages  yeast -- (3) (4 pkg)
                        ---
     1/3           cup  rye flour -- (1/2)  (2/3 cup)
     1/3           cup  whole wheat flour -- (1/2)  (2/3 cup)
  7               cups  white flour -- (11)  (14 cup )
  1               tbsp  salt -- (1 1/2)  (2 tbsp)
  1                cup  warm milk -- (1.5)  (2 cup)
  1                cup  warm water -- (1.5)  (2 cup)

Pour the boiling water over the wheat berries. Allow to stand for two hours to soften the berries.  Proof the yeast by mixing the water, sugar and yeast.

While the yeast is proofing, combine the flours and salt and drained wheat berries in a bowl.

Add the proofed yeast mixture from above,  the warm milk, and the warm water.

(Note that you may use the water that was used to soak the wheat berries.) Knead well for about 10 minutes, adding additional: white flour about 1/2 cup at a time. You may need to add 3 more (4 1/2) cups, give or take a bit.

Form into a ball, place in greased bowl covered. Rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut in two, form loaves, and allow to rise again.
You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl. If so, James feels that the bread may need some help in the second rising, in the form of a bit of heat.
As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 F. oven. This bread should have a good crunchy crust. I have made this loaf without the wheat berries, as the crust and bread is delightful without the berries, and some members of the family refer to soft berries as "erasers" and hard berries as "rocks" - refusing to eat bread with either. However, with a bit of practice, you will be able to use the wheat berries at the right point so they will be neither "rocks" or "erasers".

NOTES : I was planning to do a recipe for challah (the traditional Jewish bread) to wrap up our "Cooking of Israel" week, but I received so many requests for sufganiot (the Jewish jelly donut) that I decided to do that instead. But then I asked myself "Chef, (that's better than what I used to call myself) what about your tens of thousands of adoring and admiring readers who will be disappointed, if not downright depressed, if you don't do the challah recipe like you promised?"

I decided, in my never ending quest to satisfy all of the people all of the time and to achieve TOTAL READER SATISFACTION (trumpets and cymbals here), to include a recipe for the donuts along with the challah. So here you have it, ladies and gentlemen, two recipes for the price of... none?

                             Sweetcorn Bread

Recipe By     :Vernon Webster <vernon@the-spa.demon.co.uk>

                Whole Grain & Cereal Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2            oz  fresh yeast
  1              pound  strong unbleached white flour
     1/2         pound  maize flour
  15          fluid oz  cold water
  3                     cobs of fresh sweet corn
                        -- (or canned equivalent)
  1                     heaped teaspoon of good flavoured honey
  2                 oz  good flavoured butter
                        -- (try organic if possible)
     1/2            oz  salt

Method:-
1/ Mix yeast, honey and cold water together.

2/ Put both flours in a bowl, make a well in the centre and place yeast mixture in it.

3/ Mix some of the flour with the liquid to make a thick batter.

4/ Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to sponge for an hour or two.

5/ Whilst this is happening cut the corn off the cobs and fry - do not overcook or brown
the sweet corn. Leave to cool.

6/ When the sponge is ready knead the dough, adding the salt and sweet corn in butter. I
use an electric mixer to knead.

7/ The dough will probably be very wet so, after a couple of minutes of kneading start
adding more of the flours (hand kneaders may have to do this sooner) until the correct
dough consistency is reached.

8/ Cover and leave to rise in a cool place for about 3 hours. Climate and time of year will
make a difference (I'm in mostly cool England) but I like to 'over rise' at this stage. It
is possible to use a shorter time if preferred.

9/ Second rise until just under doubled in size - this takes only about 30 mins for me.

10/ Brush with milk or water and rub in maize flour for a nice topping.

11/ Preheat oven and bake as normal at temperatures which suit your oven. I like to heat
the oven with a tray of water at the bottom.

Variation: Add fresh chillies to taste to the sweet corn.

Serving suggestions for when the bread is a little passed fresh. I tried these and found the combinations delicious - Sorry not for anyone watching calories or fat intake.

1/ Slow oven roast ripe tomatoes in olive oil ( sprinkled with freshly ground pepper and
serve on toasted bread.

2/ Slow roast in olive oil (as above) red peppers and chillies and garlic (in skin).
Cover the roasted peppers and leave to sweat then remove the skin. Squeeze garlic from its skins.
Mix this garlic puree with the soft pepper flesh and chopped chilli Mix with butter, salt, pepper and fresh (or dried) parsley and/or marjoram.
Spread liberally on the Sweet Corn Bread and cook in the oven (in tin foil) as garlic bread - opening foil for end of cooking.



                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Thought I'd pass on the results of a recent successful experiment. I'm afraid I cannot give accurate measurements as I adjust things as I go along. The method can also be shortened by missing out the sponging. Please read through before trying - just in case I have made a mistake.

NOTES : This recipe gives both measurements for the whole wheat and unbleached flour. You can either use the cups or measure it by the weight. I have found from experience with this book that the recipes are far more superior if you weigh the flours instead of measuring by the cup. As the book explained, the reason for this is because all flours weigh differently and you do not get the right abouts if measured by cup (ie. wheat flour is a heavier flour which requires gluten to help it rise. If you used the same amount of a lighter flour it would put too much flour into the recipe and cause it to be too dry among other things.) I use a small digital scale when I measure my flours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  raisins -- soaked in
  3        tablespoons  vanilla -- for at least one
                        hour *
  1 1/4            cup  buttermilk -- **
  1                     egg
  1                tsp  salt
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  2       tablespoons.  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        -- or bread flour
  1                tsp  cinnamon -- ( optional)
  1 1/2            tsp  yeast 

* This makes a 1 1/2 lb loaf which basically fills my 2 lb machine. DO use pure vanilla extract for best results. If you don't have the time to soak the raisins ahead of time (I never do) just microwave the raisins and vanilla for 1 minute on high or med. high in a micro-safe bowl)

** (or plain milk soured with a tsp of white vinegar works fine too);

*** (the recipe calls for 2 tsp but I find this way too much yeast - blows the top off the machine).
Select basic or SWEET setting.

                        -- (105 to 115 degrees F)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2 3/4           cups  flour
  3        tablespoons  dried milk
  2        tablespoons  cold margarine or butter

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough water to make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly floured board. Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, round up. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough. Shape into loaf. Place in a greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch pan. Brush with oil or melted butter. Let stand in warm place until doubled, 45 to 60 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden and loaf sound hollow when tapped, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove immediately from pan. Brush crust with oil or melted butter, if desired. Cool on wire rack. Makes 1 loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --MIXER-- -- --(ABM)--
     1/3           cup  whole flaxseed
  1 3/4           cups  lukewarm water -- (decrease by 1/4-c)
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1            package  active dry yeast
                        or 2+1/4 tsp active dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  bread flour -- (decrease by 1/4-c)
     1/2           cup  pumpernickel flour
                        or dark rye flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
                        or white whole wheat flour
  1                     egg, lightly beaten with -- (omit)
  1         tablespoon  water, for brushing -- (omit)

1. In a blender, grind flaxseed into a coarse meal. Set aside 2 teaspoons (for topping).

2. In a large bowl, stir water and honey until honey is dissolved. Sprinkle in yeast; let stand until yeast bubbles, about 5 minutes.

3. Add 1 cup bread flour, pumpernickel (or rye) flour, salt and the remaining ground flaxseed. With a wooden spoon, stir vigorously in the same direction until batter is smooth. Gradually stir in whole wheat flour until mixture becomes too difficult to stir. (Alternatively, mix dough in a stand mixture fitted with a paddle attachment.)

4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding only enough of the remaining bread flour to keep it from sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, 10 to 12 minutes. The dough will be slightly sticky.

5. Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough in bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubles in bulk, about 90 minutes.

6. Lightly oil a 9-by-5 loaf pan or coat it with nonstick spray.

7. Punch dough down. Flatten into a disk and tightly roll dough into a log. Place seam-side down in prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until dough domes over the top of the pan, about 45 minutes.

8. Preheat oven too 400F.

9. Lightly brush top of loaf with egg mixture and sprinkle with reserved 2 teaspoons ground flaxseed.

10. Bake bread for 15 minutes at 400F. Reduce oven temperature to 350F and continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bread is pulling away from the sides of the pan. Turn bread out onto a wire rack and cool completely before slicing.

BREAD MACHINE VARIATION

1. Grind seeds as in step 1 above but do not reserve for topping.

2. In the pan of the bread machine, combine 1+1/2 cups water and 1 Tbsp. honey. Add 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, all the ground flaxseed, 1/2 cup pumpernickel (or rye) flour and 1+1/2 tsp salt. Gently tap the side of the baking pan to level ingredients. Make a small indentation in the dry ingredients and sprinkle in 1 package active dry yeast.

3. Secure pan in machine. Program according to manufacturer's directions for whole-grain and medium crust, 1+1/2-pound loaf. Press "start" and at the end of the baking cycle, remove bread from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

MAKES 1 LOAF (12 SLICES). [170 cals per slice: 6 grams protein, 3 grams fat (0.1 gram saturated fat), 32 grams carbohydrate; 270 mg sodium: 0 mg cholesterol; 5 grams fiber.]

NOTES : FLAXSEED: "I got all excited about it two or three years ago because it contains omega-3 fatty acids like fish does, so it's good for your heart. It also has a great nutty flavor and natural oils that let you make bread with almost no added fat." --Brinna Sands, King Arthur Flour Co, Vermont (www.kingarthurflour.com) Recipe edited by kitpath@earthlink.net 10/98

This recipe from the co-owner of King Arthur Flour gave instructions for the ABM as a variation of the handmade version.

Note that the abm uses less water and flour that the hand-kneaded recipe and the abm does not allow us to bake seeds into the crust - we'd lose machine heat.

NOTES : These don't bake hard like commercial. Variations/additions such as 2T Peanut Butter are OK. I think this is the best of my research and it was developed because of the good mix for the ABM in KA Bakers Catalog my dog's first homemade. If this becomes a routine, you will learn how to do it well.
Streamline by preparing containers of * ingredients for refrigerator -- ready to add flour and other ingredients to mix biscuits. I crack flax seeds in coffee grinder. Or mortar/pestle. Whiz the dry kelp strips in food processor to chop. Or soak and chop. Judging dough: The machine should not strain but this can be a strong dough. How tough is it to cut? or how stuck to the cutting board? your future guide to wet/dry. I do measure, but not always precisely. Both conditions and the Dog are very forgiving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                Pkg  Active dry yeast
  1               Tbsp  Sugar
     1/4          cups  Warm water
  1               cups  Raisins
  1               cups  Skim Milk -- Or
                        Lowfat 1% Milk, Scalded
     1/4          cups  Butter -- (1/2 Stick)
                        -- melted and cooled
  1               cups  Pureed winter squash
     1/3          cups  Firmly Packed Light Brown Sugar
  1                     Egg White -- And
  1                     Egg -- Lightly Beaten
  1               Tbsp  Grated lemon rind
  1                Tsp  Salt -- Optional
     1/4           Tsp  Cinnamon
     1/4           Tsp  Ginger
     1/8           Tsp  Mace
  2               cups  Whole wheat flour
  4               cups  All-Purpose Flour -- Approx
  1                     Egg
                        Lightly Beaten For Glaze

In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water and sugar. In a saucepan, scald the milk with the butter. Turn off heat and add raisins if desired. Let the milk mixture cool, then mix in the squash.

When milk mixture is cooled to lukewarm (baby bottle temperature), mix into yeast with brown sugar, beaten egg white and whole egg, lemon rind, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and mace. Add 2 c whole wheat flour, then enough white flour to make a workable dough. Turn out onto a floured board and knead about 8 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic, adding all purpose flour as needed to prevent sticking. Place the dough in a greased bowl, then turn to coat the top. Cover bowl with a wet towel and set in a warm, draft-free place to rise until double, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough, turn back onto the floured board, and divide in half. Form each half into 12 balls, and place on a 2 greased baking sheets. Cover with moist towels and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. When rolls have risen to double, lightly brush with the beaten egg and bake for 15 minutes or until rolls are golden brown. Cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then remove to a rack to finish cooling. These rolls freeze well. Makes 24.

* INFO * Recipe from Schumacher's New Prague Hotel in New Prague, Minnesota; about an hour's drive from the Twin Cities. New Prague (rhymes with vague) is a small town with people who are mostly of Czech and German descent. John Schumacher trained at the CIA and was raised in the area. The restaurant was featured in Best of the Midwest: Recipes from Thirty-two of American's Finest Restaurants, by Linda and Fred Griffith (Viking, 1990: isbn 0670825654). They note that the restaurant has an old World charm and decor and is a very popular spot on weekends.
