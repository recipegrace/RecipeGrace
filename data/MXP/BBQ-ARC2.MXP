  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        wings -- dry
   8      fluid ounces  Grey Poupon honey Dijon
   8      fluid ounces  honey
   4                    habanero peppers
   4                    jalapeno pepper
   6      fluid ounces  Tabasco sauce
     1/2  cup           garlic flavored bread crumbs
   4      teaspoons     butter
                        cayenne -- to taste
                        white pepper -- to taste
                        black pepper -- to taste
                        red pepper -- to taste
   1      tablespoon    garlic -- crushed

First mince up the peppers. I like to lightly sauté them first in little olive oil. Then add the butter, honey, mustard, and hot sauce. Once it starts to loosen up a bit add your four crushed peppers. Don't get skimpy here!! If you like garlic--add the tbs. of minced garlic. Bring it all to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer for a little while. When your wings are cooked get a Tupperware bowl and put enough sauce in it to cover wings. Put the top on and shake!!-----Remember--IBT!

   1      teaspoon      onion

The last time I did it I split a 4 lb. chicken and salt and peppered it
first thing before firing up the smoker and making the basting sauce.

Bring basting sauce slowly to a boil and take off heat.

I smoked it at 225 - 250F for 4 hours.  I basted it about every hour and also added a foil packet of mesquite chips to the coals (mostly mesquite with some Kingsford thrown in).

I take a little different approach to making barbecue sauce. I lived in Memphis for many years where people take barbecue VERY seriously, and I developed a refined pallet for it there.

When I make the sauce, it takes about 3 days of slow cooking (such as in a crock pot). I don't measure things, I just taste and add continuously throughout the days. The longer it can cook the better.

I do have a set of standard ingredients I use and I'll list them here. There are no amounts listed because I haven't got the vaguest idea how much I might add to make it taste just right. I like my sauce just-right spicy and NOT sweet. Sweet catsup (like many restaurant chains seem to offer) holds no appeal to me, and neither does a sauce that has no flavor apart from its burning potential.

SAUCE BASE: Low sodium V8 juice Whiskey or whiskey flavoring Tomato puree Low sodium Worcestershire sauce Molasses Horseradish Tobacco sauce Minced garlic Minced Jalapenos Onion juice Liquid smoke

ADD TO THE SAUCE (as needed): Garlic powder Cracked black pepper (lots of it) Salt Cumin (not much of it) Mustard powder Powdered cocoa Cinnamon Any more of the base ingredients

3.  Puree the rehydrated chilies, chipotles in adobo, pepper, cumin, oregano, and salt, using enough of the water from step 2 to make a paste.

4.   Sauté the onion until translucent.  Add roasted garlic and sauté for 5 minutes more.

NOTES : Chef J. P. Hayes of Sgt. Pepper's Hot Sauce Microbrewery in Austin, TX brews hot sauces, not beers.  This is his favorite barbeque sauce because of the smoky flavor of the chipotle pepper.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      head          garlic
   1      tablespoon    olive oil
     2/3  cup           water
   1      cup           pineapple juice
     1/4  cup           teriyaki sauce
   1      tablespoon    soy sauce
   1 1/3  cups          dark brown sugar
   3      tablespoons   lemon juice
   3      tablespoons   minced white onion
   1      tablespoon    Jack Daniel's Whiskey
   1      tablespoon    crushed pineapple
     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper

1. Cut about 1/2-inch off of top of garlic. Cut the roots so that the garlic will sit flat. Remove the papery skin from the garlic, but leave enough so that the cloves stay together. Put garlic into a small casserole dish or baking pan, drizzle olive oil over it, and cover with a lid or foil. Bake in a preheated 325ø oven for 1 hour. Remove garlic and let it cool until you can handle it.

2. Combine water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a medium saucepan over medium/high heat. Stir occasionally until mixture boils then reduce heat until mixture is just simmering.

3. Squeeze the sides of the head of garlic until the pasty roasted garlic is squeezed out. Measure 2 teaspoons into the saucepan and whisk to combine. Add remaining ingredients to the pan and stir.

4. Let mixture simmer for 40-50 minutes or until sauce has reduced by about 1/2 and is thick and syrupy. Make sure it doesn't boil over.

   4      medium        fresh mangos
     3/4  cup           raisins
     1/2  cup           light brown sugar
   3      cups          sugar
     1/2  tablespoon    fresh garlic -- minced
     1/2  cup           honey
   1      tablespoon    lime juice
     1/2  cup           water
     1/4  cup           vinegar
     1/2  tablespoon    ginger -- (ground)
   2      tablespoons   diced red bell pepper
     1/2  cup           diced fresh jalapenos
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/2  tablespoon    fresh ground black pepper

Peel mangos and cut from the pit. Chop into chunks. Place all ingredients into large pot. Bring mixture to boil and continue boiling uncovered for 25 minutes. Mixture will thicken slightly as liquid is reduced. Pour into large bowl of food processor, pulsing briefly to coarsely mince chutney before serving. Makes approximately 4 cups.

Note: (1) When making this recipe, make sure your kitchen is well ventilated because of the boiling jalapenos (2) Many folks will find this recipe hot enough as is, but I add 2 or 3 cups of peppers (rather than only 1/2 cup), to really make this recipe sizzle. Enjoy!

                        jalapenos
   8      ounces        cream cheese
   2      ounces        sour cream
     1/2  pound         chorizo
   1      small         onion -- minced
   1      clove         garlic -- minced

For the filling, try using a mixture of 1-8 oz packages of cream cheese, 2 oz sour cream , 1/2 lb. browned chorizo sausage, 1 small onion(minced and sautéed) and 1 clove garlic(minced and sautéed).  This filling will tend to get soft when the bacon wrapped jalapenos are smoked, but I have never tried freezing them first.  That would probably help.  I'll think you'll like them.

     1/2  cup           sour cream
   2                    taco or picante sauce

In a bowl combine cream cheese, sour cream, peppers and taco sauce until blended.  Lay a tortilla out flat and spread a thin layer of cream cheese mixture on it.  Then, tightly roll up tortilla (like a jelly roll).  Wrap in Saran wrap and refrigerate from 24 hours to 4 days.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.  After refrigeration, unwrap rolls and slice in about 1/4 " thick slices.  Serve on a platter with parsley or Boston lettuce and can be served with salsa for dipping.  This recipe makes about 80-100 slices.

TIP: Cut with a very sharp knife

   1      medium        or large onion
   1      pound         processed cheese -- (Velveeta)

For variety, pickled carrots can be substituted for Jalapenos. For different effects, additional carrots and/or jalapenos can be finely diced and added to the dip. Dip increases in jalapeno strength with age. Use blender to liquefy jalapenos, then onion and cheese, cut in 1-inch cubes. When well blended, mix in bowl with mayonnaise. Dip will stay for 2 weeks in refrigerator.

NOTES : As others have said, the wood is pimento or allspice, and has no relationship to the capsicum pimento.  There is an excellent book on Jamaican jerk by Helen Willinsky, "Jerk, Barbecue from Jamaica", The Crossing Press, ISBN 0-89594-439-1, $10.95 soft cover.  Above is a recipe for jerk marinade from her book.

   4                    dried habanero chilies or more -- (ground)
     1/3  cup           onion powder
   2      teaspoons     salt
   1      teaspoon      ground allspice

   1      teaspoon      dried thyme
   2      teaspoons     dried cinnamon
   2      teaspoons     dried nutmeg

Another dish you could try is Coconut Shrimp.  Just deep fry some shrimp in a batter to which you've added some shredded coconut.  A good dipping sauce would be crushed pineapple with a couple of good dollops of a West Indian Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce, like Matouk's or Mabel's or Hak Has.  To soak up the heat, serve some fried plantains and rice, and plenty of Red Stripe.

Let rest 1 hr. before marinating meat or poultry. 
Makes 2 1/2 cups.
 Make Jerk Chicken by marinating chicken in sauce overnight, then roasting and basting in oven till cooked (or grill, if possible). Can do same thing for ribs. Enjoy!!

This rub is similar to one posted by Scott (South Carolina) last May.  I made 3-4 changes out of necessity (Mrs. Dash) and preference (brown sugar).

Rub pork with jerk paste and place in a Ziploc baggie and refrigerate 20 minutes or up to 1 day. In a bowl combine banana, chutney, 1 tablespoon lime juice and coconut. Set aside. Prepare the grill for indirect cooking. Place drip pan between coals. Place pork in center of grill above drip pan. Cover grill, open vents and cook until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of pork registers 155F (about 20 minutes for tenderloins). Transfer to platter and keep warm. Cook pasta until just done. Drain well and return to pan. Add broth and stir over medium heat until pasta has absorbed most of broth. Mix in vinegar, minced cilantro, remaining 3 tablespoon lime juice mixed with sugar. Cut pork across grain into 1/2" thick slices. Serve over pasta and garnish with papaya and cilantro sprigs. Offer banana- chutney relish to add to taste. Note: If using the habanero pepper, do not use your bare hands to mince or apply paste to pork. Use gloves. 6 servings

   1 1/2  pounds        beef flank steak
     1/4  cup           sugar
   2      teaspoons     paprika
     1/4  cup           non-iodized salt
   2      teaspoons     garlic powder
   2      teaspoons     ground black pepper
   1      teaspoon      ginger

Fire up your smoker and start settling the coals in for a long slow smoke before starting the rub.

Pat the meat dry with a paper towel and slice it, with the blade of the knife 30F to the horizontal, across the grain, creating strips 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.

In a small mixing bowl, blend together the sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, pepper and ginger.  Rub this mixture into the meat, putting the spiced strips on the grill, but don't fill the water pan.  Give the jerky 3 to 5 hours of smoke at 130 to 180F.  propping the lid open a crack if the temperature threatens to rise disastrously beyond the desired range.

When the strips are chewy-crisp, remove them from the heat, let cool, and store individually in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate to store longer than a few days.

   2      tablespoons   liquid mesquite smoke *
   1 1/4  teaspoons     onion powder

   2 1/2  teaspoons     pepper
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar
                        up to 3 lb. lean meat **

* use in place of smoker.  ** beef, deer, elk etc.

Mix all ingredients except meat to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced meat into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 12 to 24 hours (the longer the better).  Smoke using mesquite chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven.  If doing whole operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of meat on highest rack and put shallow pan underneath to catch drippings.  Turn oven on and set to lowest possible setting and leave for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried.  A couple of hints that I picked up from one of the cooking echoes.  Use toothpicks or wooden skewers to hang meat by, and line the pan with aluminum foil to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems later on.  If you have access to sweet onions (Vidalias, etc) they can be sliced and dried and then run through the blender to make an excellent onion powder to be used in this recipe.

NOTES : A very delicious condiment to serve with all meats.  For appetizers, cut grilled/smoked chicken into chunks and let guests dip chunks in sauce. Always gets rave reviews!  Great with ham. (Chile-heads could add their favorite hot stuff to this too.)

NOTES : Someone asked about green chili. The big difference from red is cubed pork and no chile powder. All the recipes I've seen are remarkably similar. Here is one from Garry's page. I've done this using smoked shoulder. I added some cumin as well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           soy sauce
   1      cup           water
   2      tablespoons   vinegar
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar
   1      teaspoon      dry mustard
     1/2  teaspoon      ginger, powdered
     1/2  teaspoon      garlic powder
   1      teaspoon      hot pepper sauce (optional)
   2      tablespoons   corn starch

Whisk together all the ingredients except the corn starch.  Marinade the meat long enough to flavor and tenderize- 1 hr for young chicken breasts or fish, overnight for round steak and up to 5 days for some game cuts.

BBQ and baste with the marinade.  Make a slurry of the starch and a little water and whisk into the marinade.  Bring to a boil, stirring as the sauce thickens.  Serve with the BBQ'd meat.

Real garlic and ginger only improves this dish.  The amount of pepper sauce can be varied from mild to fiery.  You can substitute wine, sherry, orange or pineapple juice for some or all of the water to vary the flavor.  Pineapple juice has an enzyme that provides additional tenderizing power to the vinegar and mustard.

[Recipe Editor: the addition of 1 cup of vegetable oil to this marinade will improve the results.]

Mix all together. Cut lemons in halve add to other ingredients and heat on low, stirring often, until margarine is melted and everything is well blended. Dip chicken or pork into sauce the last 15 minutes of grilling. Save some for "dipping" at the table. Of all the recipes I have made this one receives the most praise. One lady said "it taste so good, it makes you want to get up and dance."

   2      cups          red wine vinegar
     1/4  cup           lemon juice

1.  Stem and seed the dried chilies.  Place in a skillet and put into a preheated 250-degree oven for about 4 minutes, until they become fragrant.  Shake once during the roasting time.  Remove from oven and put in just enough hot water (water just below the boiling point) to cover then put a small plate on top to submerge the chilies.  Let soak 20 to 30 minutes, until softened. 
2.  Drain the chilies and chop coarsely.  Put into a food processor or blender with the fresh chilies, garlic according to taste, onions, rosemary, salt, bourbon or brown sugar, vinegar and lemon juice.  Blend about 3 to 4 minutes, until very smooth.  Pour into a jar, cover and refrigerate. 
Note: The sauce can be used to marinate chicken, pork, ribs, or a meaty fish such as swordfish before grilling.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 3/4  pounds        sirloin tips -- (well marbled)
   1      pound         Boston butt
     1/2  pound         country smoked bacon
   1      tablespoon    Hungarian paprika
   1      teaspoon      butcher grind black pepper
   2      tablespoons   cracked black pepper
   1      teaspoon      dried marjoram
     1/2  teaspoon      ground coriander
   2      tablespoons   minced garlic
   2      teaspoons     sugar
   2      teaspoons     kosher salt
     1/2  teaspoon      Morton's Quick Cure
   1      tablespoon    mustard seeds
     1/4  cup           water
     1/4  cup           Slivovitz or other fruit brandy

Just finished making our traditional sausage for Easter and thought I might share the recipe with you all as it is a terrific sausage recipe handed down by my grandfather.  I remember making sausage and smoking them in the fireplace when I was very young.  I guess that's when I started my love for smoke cooked barbecue.  Gosh, been at it a long time!!!! Anyway, here is the recipe for real Ukrainian Kielbasa.

Cut meat into one inch cubes and place in plastic bag and into freezer.  Mince garlic to total 2 tablespoons.  Dump the kosher salt on top of the garlic and with the side of the knife blade, using a rocking motion, make a salt/garlic paste.  Place the paste in a bowl and add the remaining seasonings.  Add the water and slivovitz (plum brandy) and stir to blend all seasonings.  Grind the Boston butt and the bacon with your fine grinder plate and the sirloin tips with your coarse grinder plate.  Toss together in a bowl to mix the meats.  Pour the seasonings mixture into the bowl with the meat and blend well.  Stuff into 35mm pig casings making 24 inch lengths into rings by tying the ends of the lengths together.  Place the sausage rings on a smoke stick and bring to a cool place, under 70F, to air dry hanging in front of a fan overnight.  Cold smoke the next morning for 12 hours.  wrap in plastic wrap then foil and refrigerate overnight.  Place in skillet and add water to cover half the height of the sausage.  Boil away the water.  Reduce heat and continue to cook till browned on both sides.  Enjoy!  "Schmekouya Ho Boy!!!"

NOTES : I made this sauce for our crowd at the local "Pigfest", the official Mississippi Barbecue Cookoff, in '92.  My cousin from TX entered in pork shoulders and won first place and $300!  My sauce placed 9th out of 35 entries!!  Not bad for my first and only entry.  (It wasn't too hot as it was for kids and non-CH's too.)

   1      stick         butter
                        olive oil

Washed the Turkey.  Put 4 pieces of fatty bacon, two tablespoons of garlic salt and 1 stick of butter inside the cavity.  Rubbed the outside with Olive Oil and applied a liberal amount of Garlic Salt on top of the Olive Oil all around the Turkey.

Added Hickory and Apple to the bed of Hedge coals and let them catch fire.

Placed the Turkey on the smoker (This is a smoker with an offset firebox). When the Hickory and Apple were flaming good I buttoned down the hatches and maintained a temperature at 200F (+ or - 10F) with good white smoke.

1 hour later I basted the Turkey with the  liquids from the body cavity.

I repeated the basting process every 45 minutes.

When juices ran low in body cavity  I added another stick of butter and kept on basting.

For a 12 pound bird.  At 200F this process will take about 10 hours.

A Turkey  done this way will melt in your mouth.

Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef brisket. Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible. Also, use this marinade as a basting sauce. Some people may find Justin's 3 cups of dry red wine a little bit too much for their taste. No problem, use as much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest. Sure won't go to waste.

The beans are ready when they mash easily but still hold their shape.

Preheat oven to 325F. In a skillet fry bacon until crisp.  Remove the bacon and drain.  Add onion and pepper to the rendered bacon drippings and sauté until soft.

Transfer bacon and onion mixture to a greased Dutch oven or other baking dish.  Mix in remaining ingredients.  Bake, covered, for about 1 hour.  Uncover and bake for an additional 15 - 30 minutes

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Barbecue Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4  cup           light brown sugar -- packed
   1      package       chili seasoning* -- (1 1/4 oz.)
   2      teaspoons     dry mustard
   1      teaspoon      ginger -- ground
     1/2  teaspoon      allspice -- ground
     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      mace -- ground
     1/4  teaspoon      black pepper -- fresh ground
   1      cup           white distilled vinegar
     1/4  cup           molasses
     1/4  cup           water
  32      ounces        ketchup
   3      teaspoons     liquid smoke (optional)

*(Garry Howard's chili powder recipe is good here)

In a large saucepan, combine the brown sugar, chili seasoning, mustard, ginger, allspice, cayenne, mace, and black pepper. Add the vinegar, molasses, water, and liquid smoke. Stir until dry ingredients are dissolved. Add the ketchup and stir to mix.

Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly to avoid spattering. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Use immediately or cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

This sauce (and most barbecue sauces) improves in taste if allowed to sit overnight in the refrigerator before use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      medium        turkey
                        FOR THE RUB:
     1/4  cup           paprika
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
   1      teaspoon      black pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      parsley
   1      teaspoon      sage
   1      dash          lemon pepper
   1      teaspoon      ground dry mustard
                        FOR THE MOP:
     1/2  cup           Worcestershire sauce
     1/2  cup           soy sauce
     1/2  cup           soft drink of choice
   1      dash          sweet hot mustard
   1      dash          salt
   1      dash          pepper
   1      dash          poultry seasoning

Taste the rub--none of the ingredients should overpower another, if one does, adjust.

Rub the turkey inside and out, and refrigerate over night.

Cook the turkey breast side down. Mop when you adjust your fire. I used plain water in my water pan, and cooked for around 24 hours as I recall.

When the turkey was nearly done, I brought it in the house to finish in the oven. (Needed the gravy!)

This is the same way I do chicken, and haven't received one complaint yet.

Note that all my ingredients are approximate amounts, and I don't always use all of them.  It's all to taste, and all depends on what I got. Always starts with paprika and garlic though.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    beef brisket
                        MARINADE:
   2      cups          red wine
  32      ounces        beer
     1/2  cup           lemon juice
     1/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   liquid smoke flavoring
   8      tablespoons   garlic salt
   8      tablespoons   Accent seasoning mix
   4      tablespoons   Italian seasoning powder

Mix above ingredients in a sauce pan.  Warm to almost boiling on stove, turn off heat and let sit until cool (to blend).

Marinate full brisket for two days. (When marinating, mess with the meat as often as possible (meaning: move it around in the marinate)

Take brisket out of marinate.

Cookin instructions:

Start smoker after work at 5:pm

Rub brisket with olive oil and  heavy garlic salt then place brisket on
smoker (fat side down)  at 180F with good white smoke for 2 hours. Flip brisket and keep on smokin' for 2 more hours.  Keep that heat low now.

Remove brisket from smoker and wrap (fat side up) in heavy duty foil, sealing very well. Lay brisket  FLAT (fat side up) in deep pan.

Time bake oven at 200F for five (5) hours and go to bed.

Get up next morning and place cool brisket in refrigerator then go to work.

After work, slice cold brisket.  Reheat when ready to eat. 
For the fun of it prepare the brisket your favorite way and then follow (GOTO Cookin instructions ) the cooking instructions above.  A brisket cooked this way will be very tender and juicy.

If you want to spend a little more money:

Buy a beef tenderloin and marinate it for four (4) days.  Then smoke the tenderloin at 150F with good white smoke for three (3) hours, flipping every 30 minutes.  Place in refrigerator and let chill over night. Then slice in to (your desired thickness) steaks and singe on a grill for a great steak.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      heads         Chinese cabbage or white cabbage
   1      cup           salt
   1      pound         Daikon
   6                    spring onions
   4      cloves        garlic
   1      piece         fresh ginger root
   1      stalk         celery
   1      hard          semi-ripe pear
   4      tablespoons   ground red pepper
   1      tablespoon    granulated sugar

1. Remove (do not discard) the outer leaves from the cabbage.  Quarter the   cabbage and place together with the outside leaves in a large bowl. Sprinkle on the salt.  Let stand 3 hours, turning occasionally.

2. Peel the daikon and cut into long thin strips.  Cut the onions into 1."  strips and then shred lengthwise into slivers.  Mix the daikon and onion strips together in another bowl and let sit while the cabbage and salt mixture is sitting.

3. Peel and mince garlic and gingerroot.  Cut celery into 1" lengths and shred lengthwise.  Peel, core, and slice the pear and then cut into long strips.  Mix these ingredients together with the cayenne and granulated sugar and combine into the daikon and onion mixture.

4. The cabbage will have produced a brine after sitting.  Remove the outer leaves from the brine and set aside.  Take a quarter of the cabbage head, rinse it under running water then pack the daikon and onion mixture between the leaves. Set it in the bottom of a crock or other container. Repeat this procedure with the remaining three quarters. Any remaining mixture should be layered over the cabbage.  Press down.

5. Place the outer leaves in a layer on top of the cabbage and cover the crock. Set a small weight on top of the cover and let sit for 3 days. The longer it sits the stronger it gets!  It can be stored for a month prior to opening. Keep it in a cool (60F) place.

After removing the Kim Chi from the crock it can be stored in glass jars and used as needed.

This is a strong recipe and if it is still not hot enough, diced red
peppers with seeds can be added, to the daikon and onion mixture, but do so at your own risk! Enjoy.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      pound         raw almonds
   1      pound         raw filberts
   3      tablespoons   tamari
   1      tablespoon    ground chipotles
   1      teaspoon      salt -- (to taste)

Toss nuts with tamari in a bowl until completely coated. Add salt to taste and chilies. Spray baking sheet with Pam and arrange nuts in a single layer. Smoke at 300F for 1/2 hour stirring once after 15 minutes. Allow to completely cool so that they will be crunchy. These are great with beer, in oatmeal, and on salads.

Nuts are very easy to do on a smoker. I have smoked them at cooler temps and high temps and they seem the best when done at 300F for 1/2 hour. That would be over the hot spot in an offset smoker. Any wood will do but hickory is especially nice.

Get raw nuts in bulk at your health food store. Almonds, filberts, pecans, walnuts, peanuts are all good. The nuts need to be moist in order for the smoke to stick. 2 tablespoons of melted butter is right for 1 pound of nuts. You can also spray them with Pam. I recently have found 2 tablespoons of tamari soy sauce gives a wonderful subtle richness and will hold the smoke and spices. This also leaves them with a nice, dry coating. They will also need salt. Use a fine grain, not coarse kosher, to taste.

After tossing with butter, tamari, or Pam, add your spices. You can get very elaborate or not. I like heat and will sometimes add some hot sauce to the butter. Try any of the seasoned salts. One recipe from the chileheads list asked for 2 TABLESPOONS of Dave's Insanity in the butter. These were hot. No...they were HOT. Weird thing was, that burned cat flavor from Dave's had vanished.

                        juice of two lemons
     1/2  cup           olive oil
   3                    bay leaves, each in 3 pieces

                        sausage casings

Rinse sweetbreads, place in a pan and cover with water. Add juice of 1/2 lemon. Bring to the boil, then drain. Put liver, heart and halved kidneys in a bowl with cold water to cover and add the juice of 1 lemon. Soak for 30 minutes, then drain. Remove skin from liver and trim larger tubes from liver and heart; cut out fatty core from kidneys. Cut meats and sweetbreads into 3 cm (1-1/4 inch) pieces and place in a glass or ceramic bowl.

Blend marinade ingredients and pour over prepared meats.  Cover and leave in refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours.  Put sausage casings in cold water and leave to soak during this time.

Thread meats alternately on 6 skewers, adding 2 pieces of bay leaf to each skewer among meats.  Drain sausage casings and wind a length of casing around meats on each skewer, tucking ends into keep casings in place.

Grill slowly over glowing charcoal, turning skewers frequently and brushing kokoretsi occasionally with marinade.  Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, adjusting height of grid, or moving skewers to cooler part of fire so that kokoretsi cooks slowly.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        lean beef tenderloin
     1/2  cup           light soy sauce
     1/4  cup           dark soy sauce
     1/2  cup           water
   3      tablespoons   finely chopped green onion
   3      teaspoons     crushed garlic
   2      teaspoons     finely minced fresh ginger
     1/2  teaspoon      black pepper
   1      tablespoon    sugar
   2      tablespoons   white sesame seeds -- toasted and ground
   1      tablespoon    sesame oil

Bulgogi or Bulgalbi, broiled (grilled) beef strips and beef ribs respectively, exemplify an age-old tradition of cooking on a curved iron hotplate - a tradition that is matched in northern China and neighboring Mongolia as introduced by the Manchurians.  Today this has been streamlined for table service, with specially built cone-shaped hotplates fitted over tabletop burners, to provide an enjoyable and intimate eating experience.  Meats of all kinds, including mutton, pork and poultry, offal and seafood, are cooked in this way, being first marinated in a spicy mixture encompassing the characteristic seasonings: soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, pepper or chili, toasted sesame seeds and green onions.  The meat is marinated well in advance so that the flavor is intense.  Cooking time is minimal - just enough to cook through and seal the surface.  Serve Bulgogi with white rice and yangnyum kanjang sauce, together with a selection of accompaniments such as kim chee (chili pickled cabbage) and jeot khal (spiced whitefish).

Cut the beef across the grain into very thin slices, then cut into narrow strips.  In a glass or stainless steel dish mix all remaining ingredients together.  Add the beef and stir thoroughly.  Cover and let marinate for at least 3 hours.

Preheat a tabletop broiler (Hibachi or Ghengis Kahn Cooker), protecting the tabletop with an asbestos mat or other suitable heat shield.

Each diner, or the host/hostess, places a portion of meat on the broiler (griller) and cooks it quickly on both sides.  The meat is dipped into the sauce before eating.  Use wooden chopsticks or small forks/fondue forks.

Place meat in bowl. Add garlic, sesame seeds, green onions, pepper, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar and oil and toss to coat meat well. Cover and let marinate at room temperature 4 hrs. BBQ over hot coals, turning once until the meat is done to your liking.

Make sure you make enough, because this stuff is good for breakfast right out of the fridge too.

You can also buy this marinade ready to use in most oriental markets.  It's really good when you take a large leaf of lettuce, put some white rice on it, add a bit of green onion and the meat (without the bones) - then wrap it up.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      each          green onions -- finely chopped
   4      each          garlic cloves -- crushed
   5      tablespoons   soy sauce
   2      tablespoons   sesame oil
   1      tablespoon    sesame seeds
     1/4  cup           sugar
   2      tablespoons   sherry or mirin -- (rice wine)
     1/8  teaspoon      black pepper

Slice the steak diagonally against the grain into very thin strips.  Score each piece lightly.  (This prevents meat from curling as it is grilling).  Combine remaining ingredients in bowl, mix well, then add meat.  Allow to marinate for several hours or overnight.

To prevent overcooking, grill meat just until it turns color, then remove from heat.  Remember, all meat continue to cook even when taken off heat.  Serve with rice.

Brown the meat, chorizo and sausage. Brown the next four ingredients. Add everything else except the masa flour(don't drain any grease either). Simmer about three hours. Mix the masa with a little water and mix till there are no lumps. Stir into chili to thicken. Serve as is or over white rice(my favorite way). And don't forget to make some cornbread to go with it.

If this is prepared properly you will probably need some antacid tablets sometime in the middle of the night.

                        ***See Directions***      

I've been making roux on a daily basis for the last 3 or 4 years (part of the job). Roux can be made with any type of fat. Gravies are generally made with the fat rendered from whatever you're serving it with, i.e.: turkey, chicken, beef etc. When making a cream soup, I prefer to use unsalted butter and make a light roux.

Roux is classified in three basic categories-1*White  2*blonde  3*brown. Paul Prudhomme has come up with a black roux but I've never had the need or desire to even try this.

The darker the roux the less thickening power it has. For instance, suppose a white roux has 100 percent thickening power. A brown roux only has 30-50 percent thickening power in comparison. Once the roux is added to whatever liquid you are thickening and it comes to a boil, the thickening process is done. It will not get any thicker so adjust now if too thick or too thin.

I prefer the fast way of making roux, starting with HOT fat and wisking in the flour until I get the consistency of wet sand. This is approx. 50:50, I don't need to waste time measuring. With this high heat way of making roux, a brown roux only takes about 10-15 minutes (I don't wisk constantly, maybe every minute or two, but you do have to keep a close eye on it.

Roux can be made in the pan with the onions, bell pepper, fat, etc. and the liquid added later or you can make your liquid and let it simmer and make the roux in a separate pan and add it to the liquid at the end. It all depends on what you are making which method you should use.

I don't have any other recipes because roux is roux.

   1      can           kidney beans
   1      can           beans of your choice
   1      can           chopped tomatoes
   1      bunch         cilantro -- chopped
   1      bunch         green onions -- cut diagonally

   3      dashes        hot pepper sauce
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

Rinse the beans well in cold water. Put into a pot and add the remaining ingredients. If the juice from the tomatoes doesn't cover the beans (I doubt if it will), add some beer (Preferred) or water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook uncovered for half an hour or more to blend the flavors. Add more liquid as needed. Serve with a slotted spoon.

   1      tablespoon    canola oil

   4      large         jalapenos -- finely chopped

   3      tablespoons   ground mustard
   1      cup           cider vinegar
  12      ounces        beer
  28      ounces        catsup
     1/2  cup           brown sugar
     1/2  cup           blackstrap molasses
   2      tablespoons   cayenne pepper sauce
   1                    lime -- juice of
   1 1/2  tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1 1/2  tablespoons   kosher salt

Sauté onions, garlic, and jalapenos until soft. Add all of the dry spices and sauté about 3 minutes, scraping pan bottom. Deglaze pan with the cider vinegar. Add remaining ingredients and simmer over low heat for about 2 hours.

NOTES : I only added 1/4 cup of molasses while the sauce was simmering. After the sauce cooled I decided it needed more molasses and added 1/4 cup more. I think I liked the way the molasses tasted being added without cooking. Try doing it this way and I think you will be pleased.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  48      ounces        V-8 vegetable juice
   1 1/2  cups          cold water
   1 1/2  cups          vinegar
   2      cups          white sugar
   7      tablespoons   Knox gelatin
   1      medium        onion -- grated
                        green bell peppers -- finely chopped
                        celery, with tops -- finely chopped
                        olives -- sliced
                        green pimentos -- stuffed

Soak the gelatin in the cold water. Mix together the V-8, sugar and vinegar and bring to a boil. Now add the gelatin mixture and stir thoroughly.  Remove from heat and allow to cool for a bit (15 to 30 minutes). Pour this mixture into a mold or flat pan and add the chopped vegetables. Immediately refrigerate.

 IMPORTANT: Serve the next day or at least 12 hours later when
well set up. Serve with a dollop of Hellman's mayonnaise on top.

NOTES:   Suggestions for amounts of vegetables - 1 to 1 1/2 cups each of the chopped peppers, celery and sliced olives. 1/2 to 3/4 cup grated onion is plenty. Adjust amounts to your own taste. I chop up enough of the veggies to float in a layer measuring 3/8" to 1/2" deep.  It's good no matter how you fix it. Unflavored gelatin is now packaged in 1 tbs. (approximate) packets. Use 7 of these instead of measuring by the tbs. I chill this amount of aspic in a 9"x 13"x 2" Pyrex baking dish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    jalapeno chile with seeds -- finely minced
   3      tablespoons   fresh cilantro -- coarsely chopped
   1                    ripe avocado -- peeled and pitted
     1/4  teaspoon      kosher salt
   1      cup           water
   3      tablespoons   white onions -- diced

This is the version of guacamole you often see in little taquerias in Mexico. The spicy, thin mixture has a great smooth flavor. But the reason you see it used so often is that it is much less expensive than the famous chunky guacamole, an advantage in tiny restaurants where tacos commonly cost less than the equivalent of thirty cents. It is so good, however, that I use it even when the difference in cost is no object.

Put all the ingredients except the onion in a food processor and blend until very smooth. Pour into a bowl and stir in the onion. Use immediately.

Makes about 2 cups.

     1/4  cup           corn oil
  12                    arbol chilies -- with seeds
   2                    Roma (plum) tomatoes
   6      medium        cloves garlic
     3/4  cup           water
     1/4  teaspoon      Mexican oregano -- toasted
     1/4  teaspoon      kosher salt
     1/4  teaspoon      cumin -- toasted and ground

This is typical of what you would find on tables in northern Mexico, where salsas tend to be a little brutal -- hot and very direct with uncomplicated flavors. I love this kind of salsa on quesadillas and broiled meats. A great all-purpose condiment, a spoonful or two will enliven almost any dish. Be careful, though. People in the north like their food hot.

Pan roast tomatoes until blistered, deeply browned,  and soft. Pan roast garlic until brown and soft, then peel.  Heat the corn oil in a medium-sized skillet until hot but not smoking. Fry the chilies, 1 or 2 at a time, until puffed and brown, about 10 seconds. Do not burn or they will taste bitter. Shake off excess oil from chilies and place in a blender. Add 2 tablespoons chile cooking oil, tomatoes, garlic, and water. Blend until smooth. Add the oregano, salt, and cumin and blend again. Keeps, tightly covered, about 3 days in the refrigerator.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      large   head  garlic -- chopped
     1/4  cup           crushed black peppercorns
   1      tablespoon    course -- (or kosher) salt
     1/3  cup           dry white wine
     1/3  cup           virgin olive oil
   1      small bunch   cilantro -- stemmed and chopped

Combine all ingredients in food processor. Process by pulsing, until a medium-course paste. Spread half the marinade over pig. Rub remaining marinade in cavity. Marinate can be refrigerated for 12 to 24 hours.

I've personally not done this small a pig so your time cooking is much shorter. I have a rotisserie in my smoker so that would be my method of cooking this succulent little pig. But if you don't you can cook it in a hole in the ground to an above ground pit, a large smoker or grill. They also talk of a China Box which is basically a wooden box lined with stainless steel. It contains a pan and an elevated grill. Its kept off the ground with legs. To cook in a China Box, the meat is placed in the box, which then is covered with a stainless steel lid. Hot charcoal is placed on top of the lid. Now don't that sound fun, hope this helps and ya might check out the FAQ on whole hog.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3  cup           oil
     2/3  cup           flour
   2      cups          onion -- chopped
   1      cup           celery -- chopped
     1/2  cup           green bell pepper -- chopped
   4      cloves        garlic -- minced
     1/4  cup           parsley -- chopped
     1/4  cup           green onion tops -- chopped
     1/4  cup           hot water -- approximately

Mix oil and flour together in a 4 cup measure. Microwave uncovered on high (100%) 6-7 minutes. Stir at 6 minutes - roux will be a light brown at this time and will need to cook 30 seconds to 1 minute longer to reach the dark brown color so important in making Louisiana gumbos and stews.

The Roux will be very hot, but usually the handle on your glass measuring cup will stay cool enough to touch. Add onion, celery and bell pepper to Roux in measuring cup. Stir and return to microwave. Sauté on high (100%) 3 minutes. Add garlic, parsley and green onion to Roux, stir and return to microwave. Sauté on high (100%)
2 minutes. You should have about 3 3/4 cups of Roux now. If any oil has risen to the top, pour this off. 
Slowly add enough hot tap water to bring Roux to the 4-cup mark. Stir and you will have a smooth dark Roux in only 12 minutes. Roux freezes very well and you are ready at any time to put together a delicious gumbo or stew.

NOTES : NOTES : From: Tout de Suite a la Microwave I...
The microwave will brown my roux and even do the gaspergou.  Now if you like to stir a lot, just cook yours in a black iron pot.

   1      cup           yellow cornmeal
     1/2  cup           all-purpose flour
   1 1/2  teaspoons     baking soda
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   1      cup           buttermilk
   1                    egg -- beaten
     1/4  cup           onion -- finely chopped

Heat about 3 inches Crisco Shortening or Crisco oil to about 365F in a deep iron skillet or deep fat fryer.

Combine cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt in large bowl..  Stir in
buttermilk, egg and onion. Drop by the tea or table spoonful, a few at a time into the shortening or oil.  Fry 2 minutes or until dark golden brown. Turn as need to brown evenly. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  You can also substitute cornmeal mix for the cornmeal, baking soda, and salt. Makes about enough for 8 Bubbas

There are about as many ways to make hushpuppies as there are people who eat 'em so I'm sure other Bubba's will disagree with me here.

Meringue:

(Note: if you are using a copper bowl, omit cream of tartar, you'll get pavement instead of meringue.  The chemical reaction between the bowl and the egg does the same thing as the cream of tartar.)

Beat egg whites, vanilla and cream of tartar until mixture holds stiff peaks.  Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until very stiff and glossy.  All sugar must be dissolved.

Makes a great dessert after a big ol' plate of barbecue.

     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      paprika

Mix rub ingredients and store in air-tight container.

If using spare ribs, cut off chine bone to turn them into St. Louis cut.  Remove the membrane.  Rub on spice mixture, place ribs in a zipper plastic bag and allow to sit 24 hours in refrigerator.

Prepare smoker and get cooking section to 180-200F.

Remove ribs from refrigerator and give them a rub with canola oil.  Give the ribs another sprinkle of the rub, but do not rub it in.

Place ribs in smoker and over the first hour gradually increase temperature to 240-250F.

Each hour, turn ribs and give them a mop.

Ribs should be done in 4-5 hours.  They are done when the meat starts to pull away from the ends of the bones about 1/2 inch and they are limp when picked up in the middle.

About 15 minutes before the ribs are done, paint them on both sides with some warm honey.  Return the ribs to the smoker.

If Montreal Steak Seasoning is unavailable in your area, you can use the substitute in the mop in place of the 2 TB of Montreal Steak

NOTES : The rub is a modified version of one by David Klose.

I follow Danny Gaulden's advice and get racks of ribs with more fat.  This makes the ribs really tender and juicy.  I do not trim off any fat before smoking.  Trim off any excess external fat while slicing ribs for serving.

Garry Howard suggested the honey glaze.  These ribs are a real team effort.

                      Lemon-Rosemary Chicken Halves

Recipe By     : Born to Grill, Jamison & Jamison
Serving Size  : 4    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***PASTE***
     1/4  cup           packed fresh rosemary sprigs
     1/3  cup           olive oil
   1                    lemon, zest and juice of
   1 1/2  tablespoons   chopped onion
   2                    garlic cloves
   1 1/2  teaspoons     coarse salt
   2      whole         chickens -- halved
                        OR 6-pounds chicken
   1                    lemon -- cut in wedges
                        fresh rosemary sprigs
                        lemon slices

At least 3 hours and up to the night before you plan to grill chicken, prepare paste. Puree rosemary with oil in blender, preferably, or a food processor. Let rosemary steep in the oil for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain mixture to remove tough little leaves. Return oil to blender, add remaining ingredients, and puree. The paste will be somewhat soupy.

Coat each chicken half thoroughly with paste, rubbing inside and out and working as far as possible under the skin without tearing the skin. Place chicken in a plastic bag and refrigerate.

Fire up grill, bringing the temperature to medium (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test).

Remove chicken from refrigerator and let sit covered at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Drain chicken and blot any excess moisture from surface.

Transfer chicken halves to grill and arrange them skin-side up. Grill uncovered over medium heat for about 20 minutes, without turning, then cook an additional 30 to 40 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, ending with chicken skin side down for a final crisping. You want chicken skin to face the grill enough to render its fat and brown, but not burn. Watch for flare-ups, shifting halves away from flame if necessary. Squeeze lemon wedges over chicken's cavity about halfway through cooking. If grilling covered, cook chicken starting skin-side up over medium heat for about 15 minutes, without turning, then cook an additional 25 to 30 minutes, turning three times and squeezing lemon wedges over chicken's cavity about halfway through cooking.

Arrange chicken on a platter. Garnish with rosemary and lemon slices, if you wish, and serve immediately. Serves 4.

Mix all ingredients together. If you want it sweeter, add more honey. If you want it with more bite, add more mustard. Slather generously over chicken, ribs, shrimp, or pork, or use as a sauce for dipping.

Once again this is from cookin with Bob.

Try it,  play around with it.  Hey, I know! But it's good in a pinch. Actually it is pretty good, especially if you spice it up a bit.

   1      quart         ketchup

   4      ounces        crushed red pepper
   1      pinch         red cayenne pepper -- ground

Combine all ingredients into a 1.5 gallon stock pot along with 1 gallon of water and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Spoon the piping hot dip onto the prepared meat just prior to serving. This is a very thin sauce, but it is the same formula that has been used around here for generations.

This recipe was posted a while back by the son-in-law of the owner of Lexington #1, a highly regarded Q-joint. There is a certain amount of vagueness about whether the measurements are by weight or volume. I used weight for the dry ingredients and am very happy with the results.

Lexington Barbecue, I thought I'd share their recipe for coleslaw (you know, the kind you put in the sandwich with the Q).  Pam and I were fortunate enough to visit Lexington Barbecue back in July.  We really liked the slaw.  It was a nice alternative to the mayo/half-n-half/cream based slaws typical of other areas.  I wrote to Allen H., and he kindly shared their recipe.  I reduced the quantities listed if you don't want to follow Allan's recipe (in parentheses).

Mix all dry ingredients into the chopped cabbage, and let sit for 20 minutes.  Then add the wet ingredients and mix well.  Allow to refrigerate as long as possible before serving.

We've made this twice since getting home.  Used it on pork BBQ sandwiches and as a side with ribs.  Mmmmm good.

   1      pinch         cayenne

Made up a batch of Lexington #1 dipping sauce to go with my pork butt tonight.  Very delicious, indeed.  I broke it down in half and used the highly scientific method of buying 2 ounces of pepper, measuring it, and using that as the basis for dried measurements. 
Next time I'll reduce the salt and sugar a little bit (1/8 to 1/4 cup each?)

Sauce was great..  Perfect compliment to pork.  The idea of using it hot is so obvious, but was a big revelation to me.  Keeps the meat nice and hot.  Didn't get around to making slaw.

                        skinless salmon fillets -- diced
                        fresh green limes or key limes
     3/4  cup           diced Vidalia onions
     3/4  cup           diced garden fresh tomatoes
   1      bunch         fresh cilantro -- coarsely chopped
   1      small         tomatillo -- diced
   1      clove         garlic -- crushed
                        fresh chile peppers
                        olive oil
                        fresh rosemary -- crushed

Make some nice skinless Salmon fillets.  Dice the fillets into 1/4 inch cubes, about 1/2 to 3/4 cup or more.  Put into a bowl.  Squeeze the juice of enough fresh, green limes or key limes, to just cover the salmon.  Stir every half-hour, for about 4 to 8 hours until the meat is done.

While you're waiting, dice up about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of nice Vidalia or Hana, Maui onions.  Dice some chives.  Dice about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of nice garden fresh tomatoes.  Coarsely chop a nice fresh bunch of Cilantro.  Dice one small Tomatillo.  Crush one clove of garlic.  Add a small amount of your favorite chilies, if you want; but be careful not to overwhelm the delicacy of the Salmon.  Get out your freshest, nicest tasting Olive oil, flavored or not.

You may have noticed that the acid in the lime juice is actually "cooking" the salmon.  No, really! When the Salmon is "done", drain off and reserve the lime juice.  Mix in all of the other ingredients, except the olive oil. With a little of the lime juice and a little of the Olive oil, make a dressing for the Salmon.  Fresh crushed Rosemary is a nice garnish and a very good flavoring for the dressing.

NOTES : LONGANIZA/LINGUICA
"The Spanish longaniza is usually served fresh, while the Portuguese linguica is frequently smoked.  It's traditionally stuffed into the narrow sheep casings, but you can also use the more easily obtainable hog casings.  There are several companies in America who make linguica, especially in New England where many Portuguese immigrants settled.  Linguica are even included in many traditional New England clambakes.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Other Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        sprats, anchovies, or mackerel
   2      pints         salt per peck of fish
   2      pints         old wine per pint of fish -- optional

It is best to take large or small sprats, or, failing that, take anchovies, or horse mackerel, or mackerel, make a mixture of all, and put into a baking trough. Take two pints of salt per peck of fish and mix well so that fish are impregnated with salt. Leave it for one night, and then put in an earthenware vessel which you place, open, in the sun for two or three months, stirring with a stick at intervals, then take it, cover it with a lid, and store away. Some people add old wine, two pints per pint of fish [to the fish at the beginning of the fermentation process]. Drain the resultant sauce and store until use.

[Modern day nuoc nam is made by putting a layer of fish in a vat, adding a layer of salt, and repeating the process until the vat is full. After a few days the liquid is drained off from below and tipped back onto the top of the heap; this process is repeated several times. Finally, a wicker lid is placed on the vat and weighted down, and the fish are left to ferment and mature for several months. The resultant sauce is then drained and bottled as nuoc nam].

It can also be made from most any type of shellfish. If fish are smoked prior to salting, it should be a very light smoke so as not to dry the fish out or otherwise impede the fermentation process.

                        ***CARAMEL TOPPING***
   1      cup           sugar
   2      tablespoons   water
                        additional water for sides of pan
                        ***CUSTARD***
   1      cup           sugar
   4      ounces        light cream cheese
   1      12 oz. can    evaporated skim milk
   1      cup           fat-free liquid egg substitute
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract

Heat the oven to 325F. Select a baking dish large enough to hold a second, 2-quart baking dish inside. Fill the larger pan with about 1-inch of water and place it in the oven. (Make sure the larger dish doesn't overflow when the larger dish is set inside.)

In a saucepan with a heavy bottom, combine the ingredients for the caramel topping. Stir the sugar and water together over medium heat until the sugar starts to dissolve. Dip a basting or pastry brush in the additional water and brush any sugar granules down the sides of the pan. (This will prevent the sugar from crystallizing before it caramelizes.) Boil the sugar mixture without stirring until it turns brown (about the color of pancake syrup) and develops a distinct aroma. This will take about 10 to 12 minutes. Do not let the syrup turn black.

Pour the caramelized sugar syrup into the 2-quart flan dish and immediately swirl it around the bottom and sides of the dish to form a transparent coating. Be careful not to touch or splash yourself with the syrup because it is extremely hot and can cause serious burns. Set the caramel topping aside to cool while you prepare the custard.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the sugar and cream cheese. Beat until the cream cheese is fluffy and the sugar has dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. On low speed, beat in the evaporated skim milk, egg substitutes and vanilla extract. Do not allow the mixture to froth. Strain the flan mixture to remove any lumps of cream cheese and pour over the caramelized topping. Set inside the larger dish and bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour; or until the custard is set. Cool 30 minutes inside the water then cool an additional hour at room temp. Place in refrigerator and chill completely.

When ready to serve, use a knife to loosen the flan from the sides of the baking dish. Invert the dish over a platter with a lip into a shallow bowl. There will be quite a bit of syrup, so do not invert onto a plate. Serve with fresh fruit if desired.

Unthaw and blend juices in punch bowl. Add club soda just before serving. I make ice cubes( or use a ring mold) out of reconstituted lemonade or orange juice and place in punch at serving time. This keeps the punch cool without diluting it. I slice oranges, lemons or limes and place those in the ring mold for decoration too. Naturally if you have it on hand--this stuff will blend well with some good vodka or some Bombay Sapphire gin.

Do not clean mushrooms with water, it makes them watery, and they are grown in sterile soil so a speck of dirt won't hurt, use a mushroom brush or a damp paper towel. Clean and destem mushrooms and sauté in about 1 T butter till slightly cooked. Remove and set on cookie sheet underneath side up to stuff.  In a food processor or blender, chop the green onions, then add and pulse the cooked sausage till crumbled fairly small. Add softened cream cheese and Parmesan cheese and blend until thoroughly mixed.  Use a teaspoon or piping bag to mound filling onto mushroom caps. Bake at 350øF for about 10 minutes. Then set oven to broil and brown tops lightly. Serve hot. You could fer sure throw these in a foil pan and stick them on the grill ...

                        salt and pepper to taste -- paprika

Slice potatoes in half when cool enough to handle. Scoop out centers and place shells on a cookie sheet. Place potato centers in a bowl and  blend 1 cup of the cheddar cheese and remaining ingredients into potatoes, except for paprika. Beat till light and fluffy. Spoon back into potato shells. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar and lightly sprinkle with paprika. Bake at 350F for 20 minutes or till heated through and cheese is bubbly on top, or grill for about 15 minutes in a shallow baking pan.

Heat olive oil. Add onion, garlic, chicken and Tasso. Sauté until chicken is cooked. Squeeze all the juice from the collard greens and add them. Cook 1-2 minutes. Pour into colander and drain. Spread mixture out and let cool. Squeeze out mixture in a towel. The drier the better. 
Lay the egg roll wrappers on a clean, dry surface dusted lightly with corn starch, setting them up in a diamond pattern. Portion 3/4 cup filling onto each wrapper. Mix 2 Tbs. cornstarch in a bowl with cold water to make a paste. Lightly brush edges of each wrapper with paste. Fold bottom diamond up. Then the sides. Then the top. Lightly dust to keep them dry. Fry at 340F until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

Donald Barickman serves these with a roasted red pepper sauce, spicy mustard, and peach chutney. I used my favorite  habanero-mango sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

Luau pig is a bit labor intensive, but outstanding!!!

Round up some large male friends and neighbors.  Tell them to bring shovels.  You go and buy about 6 cases of beer and some ice to keep it cold.  (About a half a case per male friend or neighbor with shovel - no shovel, no beer).

Prior to getting your friends and neighbors together, look around and find a source for very old, round river rocks, that have not been in or around water in a long, long, geologic time.  What you're trying to find is good cooking rocks, that won't explode when you heat them.  You'll need about 15 to 30 the size of your head, depending on the size of the pig.  Wood, a big hunk of chicken wire fencing to go around and lift the pig, small spool of stainless steel wire, lots of burlap bags, and banana leaves if you can find them.  (leaves of "Elephant Ear" plants will also work, as these are a form of upland Taro)  You'll also need one or two pieces of sheet metal big enough to cover the pit completely, and two pieces of plywood to go over
the sheet metal.  Heavy gloves for everyone.

Once you've got the rocks, the neighbors, the beer, the small to medium pig, and a big pickup load supply of hardwood, (preferably mesquite, but any good cooking hardwood or fruitwood will do.), assemble your friends and neighbors with shovels in your backyard and dig a hole. About 4 or 5 feet deep, and about 10 to 12 inches bigger than the pig all around.

Drink beer about 3 times during the digging if its a hot day. Now, at about 3pm, build a medium size fire in the bottom of the pit.  When its burning well, put in a bunch of your rocks around the fire, then start sliding pieces of your hardwood vertically into the bottom of the pit, all around the sides of the pit.  Get it??  Keep loading in wood, fairly fast, as it burns to coals, until you have a bed of red-hot coals about 1 to 1.5 feet deep.

Meanwhile, some of your other friends and neighbors have cleaned up the pig, (it has been gutted, right??), it is laying on layers of: 1) wet burlap, 2) banana leaves, 3) wet burlap, 4) chicken wire, 5) pig, on its back, legs in the air.  Season the pig with about a cup of rock salt, and black pepper.

Next step is to fish 3, 4, or 5 hot rocks, (whatever will fit), out of the fire pit, and place inside the stomach cavity of the pig.  (before putting in the rocks, punch some holes in the belly skin, on both sides so you can wire the belly skin together over the rocks.)

Working quickly now, fish the rest of the rocks out of the fire pit, make a shallow depression in the coals with shovels or garden rakes, heaping some of the coals up the sides of the pit; wrap the chicken wire, burlap, leaves and all around the pig, wrap and hold with wire.  Leave the two edges of the chicken wire sticking up out of the burlap and leaves on top.  These will be the handles you use to lower and raise the pig into and out of the pit.

It should now be late afternoon, early evening.  Lower the pig into the bed of coals.  Place the hot rocks around and pile on top of the pig.  Rake coals over the sides.   (The plywood is there to supply strength for the next step.  If your sheet metal is fairly thick and heavy, {strong}, you can forget the plywood.)  Now shovel dirt from the hole all around the pit to seal the edges of the sheet metal, shovel about a half inch of dirt or more on top of the sheet metal for insulation.  Drink more beer.  All but 3 or 4 of your friends can go home now.

Get out some lawn chairs, set up a table, bring the TV out to the backyard, layout a couple sleeping bags, and take turns making sure nothing catches fire, (the plywood), and not too much smoke and heat escapes.

Depending on the size of the pig, anytime from about 10am next morning and 2pm next afternoon, have all your friends, and their families show up with their part of the potluck.  Drinks, potato salad, poi if you like that sort of thing, fish dishes, Jell-O and dessert.

Carefully rake away and sweep away the dirt from the top of the pit. Remove the plywood and sheet metal.  With rakes or shovels, gently pull away the coals and hot rocks from around the pig.  With rakes, or hooks made out of rebar, about four guys grab both sides of the chicken wire and carefully heave the pig out of the pit.  A wooden table is best at this point, and lots 'n lots of pots, bowls, and large containers; plus a garbage can to discard the bones.  Open the chicken wire and pull away from the pig.  (It is traditional in Hawaii that the guys who have done the hot, heavy work of cooking this pig, gets first choice of the crackly skin and meat that clings to the chicken wire. 
Using big cooking forks and the biggest knives in your arsenal, carve and rake the meat from the bones and put into the pots, bowls and containers. (The meat should be so tender at this point, that it nearly falls from the bone.)

During the carving, someone should take *all* the rocks out of the pit and then be watering and putting out the fire that remains.  (The rocks will shatter and explode if you water *them*). The rocks need to be taken out of the pit and set aside safely so no one gets burnt on them, and saved for the next luau. Even watering the pit, the hole will be quite hot, so a couple guys should start filling it in with the dirt they took out yesterday!

You've worked hard.  Drink more beer.  Eat.  Life is good!!!!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        spareribs
                        ***FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE***
   2      cups          margarine or butter
   1      cup           cider vinegar
   1      cup           catsup
   6      ounces        jar prepared horseradish
   6                    limes or lemons -- (the juice)
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      tablespoon    Worcestershire sauce
   1      teaspoon      hot pepper sauce

PREPARE FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE: In a medium stainless-steel or enamelware saucepan melt margarine or butter slowly.  Add vinegar, catsup, horseradish, lime or lemon juice, salt and Worcestershire and pepper sauces.  Simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes to blend flavors.  Use as basting sauce for pork, chicken or other meats and serve as a table sauce.  Leftover sauce can be refrigerated and kept up to a week.  NOTE: If using this sauce for chicken, lemons are better than limes; limes give a pleasant tang to pork and other meats. 
DIRECTIONS: Place ribs about 6 inches above hot coals.  Brush lightly with sauce and brown on one side.  Keep a water bottle handy when using this sauce as it causes flames to shoot up.  Turn, brush again with sauce, and brown the other side.  Continue turning and basting every 10 minutes until ribs are done, about 1 hour.  Check by cutting near bone in a center section.  If juices run clear or golden the ribs are done.  Remove ribs to a platter.  Cut into 1- to 3-rib sections and serve with any remaining sauce.

For those of you who like barbecue, I offer one of my late
father's concoctions for basting, which I learned today is
also called the mop (thanks, Richard Thead).

M. L.  McLemore's Lone Star Baste
 (as remembered by his daughter, Martha)

2   6-packs of Lone Star beer, one on ice, the other one doesn't  matter
1   quart of cheap vinegar (better to scrimp on the vinegar than on the beer)
1   small bottle Tabasco, no substitutes
1   large head of garlic, peeled and finely minced
1   4-ounce can black pepper
1   small jar French's yellow mustard (baby crap, he called it, but he ate it on almost everything - go figure!)
6   dried jalapeno peppers, crushed, seeds and all (firecrackers, he called them)
1   pound of butter, melted (none of that greasy margarine, for crissake!)
1   more 6-pack of Lone Star, on ice
1   50 pound bag of ice
1   side of beef or one helluva big pig
2   young'uns with fly swatters, on rotating shifts (there were 6 of us at the time)
1   wheel of cheddar, the kind that smells like work socks at the end of the day
2   boxes of crackers
1   case of Pik coils
2   lawn chairs, one for his butt, one for his feet
1   Stetson; his cookin' hat, not the one he wore to the rodeo
1   pair of shades, made out of welder's glass
2   cartons Lucky Strikes or Camels (filters?!  Real men don't smoke filtered butts, what's the matter with you, FOOL?!)
1   Zippo lighter, circa 1943, extra flints and fluid
1   more 6-pack of Lone Star, on ice
1   loud, wind-up alarm clock, the one he called "The Voice of God"
2   50-pound bags of mesquite or pecan chips, soaked in water overnight in the dogs' washtub, which was actually one of those galvanized cattle troughs - nothing was too good for his 'dawgs'.  (Jealous of his dogs, you say?  Damn right, I was!   He never hit his dogs and they didn't have to swat flies for him!)

1   6-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon, ice optional (Never give the good stuff to the neighbors who wandered over, but always have something to give them!  M. L.'s personal Code of the West.)

Empty one 6-pack of Lone Star into a 3 gallon stock pot. Add the vinegar, mustard, Tabasco, butter, peppers, garlic and a fifth of water.  Bring to a high, rollin' boil to melt the butter; keep hot on the cool end of the grill.

Fire up the cooker when you get home on Friday night.  Burn a couple or three mesquite logs (his preference) to get a foot-thick bed of cherry-red coals.  Close the grill to keep in the heat.  Add sufficient wet chips to produce enough smoke that the new neighbors call the fire department, but not so much that you put out the fire.  (Long-time neighbors just bring in the wash, close their windows and wait him out.)

When the smoke dies down so you can get near the grill, unearth the beast of honor from the washtub, rub it dry, sprinkle with the lightest coat of salt and brown sugar, lay the carcass on the grill.  Quick, close the lid and prepare for the rest of the event.

Ice down the rest of the beer in the washtub.  (Hell, yes, in the same water!  Just add more ice; eventually the water won't be pink anymore.  Besides, you don't drink the water, now, do you?)

Set up "camp," as it were.  Send the kids after whatever you forgot, like the Coleman lantern, your long-sleeved shirt and the TV-trays.  And the pie-screen, to keep the bugs off the cheese.  Those tiny sweet pickles and another jar of mustard.  And that little portable transistor radio, don't forget the extra batteries.

Every half-hour or so, check the coals and the beast.  Add chips to the one and baste the other.  In the beginning, it's easy to keep which is which straight, but by Saturday afternoon, when this repast is *supposed* to be ready, the longs hours of no sleep and Lone Star have taken their toll. It was not uncommon to find wood chips charred to the carcass and the favorite basting brush singed beyond recognition.  (They loved my father down at the paint store; sold him more 3" bristle brushes than any other two stores' customers combined.)

After around 3 am, those of us not on bug patrol were no longer awakened by the "Voice of God", M. L. having tossed it across the highway into the oil field.  I think it gave him no end of joy to imagine that clock coming to rest next to some aged rattlesnake, vibrating the old viper out of its last 6 buttons, at least.

In the morning, the rest of us would enjoy a good breakfast then wander out to see how the sacrifice was coming along. Daddy's breakfast empties were neatly placed back into the wooden case, courtesy the second shift bug patrol, or my mother.  I guess she didn't object to his drinking in public, as long as he didn't appear to be a slob about it.

He hardly ever used the full case of Pik coils.  After midnight or so, no self-respecting mosquito or fly came with 100 yards of M. L. or the grill.  If the beer didn't do the trick, there was always that marvelous baste simmering on the back of the grill.

Although the bugs gave Daddy's barbecue a wide berth, he had to quietly let only a few trusted friends know when he was planning to cook because his was the absolute best barbecue for miles and miles around.  Even his enemies acknowledged his expertise:  "That McLemore is one sorry s.o.b., but god-almighty, can that man cook!"

Around noon, the friends who were invited and the dogs' pals began to gather.  You know how it is said that dogs and their owners often resemble one another after a few years of cohabitation?  Well, you could certainly tell which of the 20 or so mutts criss-crossing our yard on barbecue day belonged to Daddy.  They were the ones lapping up spilled Lone Star, wolfing down stinky cheddar loaded with mustard, and the only ones all the other dogs refused to sniff.

There's a recipe somewhere in all of this, but danged if I remember where I put it.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        FOR THE CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUST:
   4      ounces        chocolate wafer cookies
   2      tablespoons   unsalted butter -- melted
                        FOR THE CHEESECAKE:
   6      ounces        semisweet chocolate
  12      ounces        cream cheese -- room temperature
   1      teaspoon      vanilla extract
     1/2  cup           sugar
   2      large         eggs
   1      pinch         salt
   2      cups          sour cream

FOR THE COOKIE CRUST:
Butter only the sides of an 8"x2.5" or 8"x3" Springform pan, not the bottom.  The cookies must be ground to crumbs.  Either break them into pieces and grind them in a food processor with a steel blade; OR grind them in batches in your blender; OR place in a heavy plastic bag and pound and roll them with a rolling pin until they are fine.  You should have 1 cup of crumbs.

Mix the crumbs with the melted butter in a bowl, using a rubber spatula until the butter is evenly distributed.  You will think there is not enough butter, but there is.  Pour it into the baking pan and use your fingers to press it into a compact, even layer on the bottom only.  Refrigerate 
FOR THE CHEESECAKE:
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Melt the chocolate (I do it in my microwave; it takes about 2 minutes on High, but I stop every 30 seconds to stir it to ensure it doesn't burn) and set aside to cool slightly.  Beat the cream cheese until very smooth.  Add the vanilla and sugar and beat to mix.  Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating till smooth after each.  Then add the salt and 1 1/2 cups of the sour cream and beat till smooth.

Beat the melted chocolate with the remaining 1/2 cup sour cream (you can use the same beaters you used for the cheese mixture without washing them). Remove 1 1/2 cups of the cream cheese mixture and beat into the chocolate.

Place the two batters, alternating colors, by spoonfuls over the crust in the pan.  Use the flat side of a table knife to marbleize: cut down through the batters and use the knife to swirl them into large spirals and/or zigzags and form an attractive pattern.  Don't over mix or you'll lose the contrast.

Briskly rotate the pan a bit first in one direction, then the other, to level the top.  Bake 30 minutes on the lowest rack in your oven. It will seem soft, but it's done.  Cool on a rack to room temperature, then chill at least 5-6 hours before serving cold.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   8                    bacon strips
   1      medium        onion - chopped
   2      medium        cans Van Camps pork 'n beans
   2      tablespoons   prepared mustard -- (one good squirt)
   1      tablespoon    Worcestershire sauce
     3/4  cup           dark brown sugar
     1/4  cup           un-sulfured molasses - or country syrup
     1/2  cup           Hunts ketchup
                        ***OPTIONAL ITEMS***
     1/4  cup           BBQ sauce, (your favorite)
   1      tablespoon    chili powder
   1      small         can crushed pineapple

I used to watch my mama make these beans. Love them. Finally wrote it down for you. Been making them 20 years myself.

Preheat oven 350F Half-cook bacon and brown onions in skillet (bacon will finish cooking on top of beans)

Place beans in casserole. Add sautéed onions, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, molasses and Worcestershire sauce. (Stir bacon fat into beans, if desired)

Lay half-cooked bacon on top and bake covered with foil at 350F for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 20 minutes to finish cooking bacon. Or, you can cook for 2 hours at 300F if you like. To do so, bury the bacon in the beans first so it won't burn and cook uncovered. This will thicken up the dish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***BRINE***
     1/2  cup           salt
     1/3  cup           sugar brown
     1/2  teaspoon      maple flavoring
   1      teaspoon      onion powder
   1      teaspoon      celery salt
   1      cup           white wine
   1      tablespoon    pepper
   3      cups          water

Place turkey in brine for 8 to 12 hours.  Remove from brine.  Rinse and air dry for at least one hour.  Open upper and lower body cavities to expose to smoke.  Place in smoker and smoke with your favorite fuel.  Smoke for 30 minutes per pound approximately.  i.e.  10 lbs. = 5 hours

Remove from smoker and bake in the oven at 300F for about 15 minutes per pound.  You may also use your smoker, if it is a convertible model, in a roast mode to cook the turkey.  Turkey is done when joints separate easily from the body and if the meat is pierced with a toothpick the juices are clear.  Watch the bird closely during the roasting phase as different birds will require greatly differing time for cooking depending upon the temperature of the smoker.

NOTE: If desired the brown sugar may be replaced with maple syrup giving the bird a more maple flavor.

     1/2  teaspoon      oregano
     1/4  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/4  teaspoon      onion powder
     1/2  cup           lemon juice
     1/4  cup           vegetable oil
   4      each          skinless boneless chicken breast halves

Combine dry spices in small bowl. In a shallow glass dish large enough to hold chicken in a single layer, place lemon juice and oil. Add half of spice mix; stir to combine. Add chicken breasts, turning to coat both sides. Marinate 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature or 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator, covered. Drain chicken from marinade and sprinkle both sides with remaining seasoning mix. Place breasts on hot grill with the thin ends away from the flames. Cook, turning once, until just cooked through, 3 to 8 minutes per side, depending on heat intensity and thickness of meat. Makes 4 servings.

                        ***MARINADE***
     1/2  cup           tequila
     1/4  cup           fresh lime juice
   1 1/2  ounces        orange juice concentrate -- thawed
   2      teaspoons     vegetable oil
   1 1/2  pounds        medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
                        soaked bamboo skewers
   3                    fresh jalapenos -- cut as directed
   1      large         red bell pepper -- cut
                        into 1/2-inch squares
                        coarse salt
                        minced fresh cilantro
                        lime wedges

CUT each jalapeno into 8 small pieces

Prepare marinade, combining ingredients in a small bowl. Place shrimp in a plastic bag or shallow dish, pour marinade over them and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Fire up grill, bringing temperature to high (1 to 2 seconds with the hand test).

While grill heats, drain shrimp, discarding marinade. Skewer shrimp with jalapenos and bell pepper pieces, avoiding crowing. Slide one end of the first shrimp on a skewer, add a piece of jalapeno and bell pepper to rest in the curve of the shrimp, and then slide the other end of the shrimp over the skewer. Repeat on the same skewer with a second shrimp and the jalapeno and bell pepper pieces. Assemble remaining kebabs and sprinkle them lightly with salt.

Grill kebabs uncovered over high heat for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes per side, until shrimp are just opaque with lightly browned edges. The jalapeno and bell pepper should remain a bit crisp. If grilling covered, cook kebabs the same amount of time, turning once midway.

When done, sprinkle kebabs lightly with cilantro and serve them hot, with lime wedges for squeezing.

VARIATION from serving the shrimp on the skewer, the Jamisons sometimes pile them in margarita glasses with salted rims and lime wedges. About 2+1/4 dozen kebabs.

   3      cups          dry red wine
   1      cup           olive or peanut oil
   2      tablespoons   wine vinegar

   2      tablespoons   prepared horseradish
   3      tablespoons   lime juice
   2      teaspoons     ground cayenne pepper

Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef brisket.  Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible.  Also, use this marinade as a basting sauce.  Some people may find Justin's 3 cups of dry red wine a little bit too much for their taste.  No problem, use as much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest.  Sure won't go to waste.

                        thick sirloin tip roast -- 3 inch
     1/2  cup           oil
     1/2  cup           red table wine
                        juice of one lemon
     1/4  teaspoon      oregano
     1/4  teaspoon      thyme
     1/4  teaspoon      rosemary
   1      teaspoon      MSG
   3      tablespoons   green onion flakes
   1      teaspoon      salt
                        lots of black pepper

   1                    bay leaves
   2      tablespoons   meat tenderizer

Place in jar and shake well..  Take large fork and poke holes in
roast.  Place roast and marinade in large Ziploc bag, or in flat pan and squeeze or turn to thoroughly coat meat.  Let marinate 2 days in refrigerator. 
I made a  medium fire in the bottom of the smoker and left out the
water pan and placed the roast on the grill for about 20 minutes per side.  It is supposed to be medium, not well done. You'll have to check for doneness then and if not done to your taste, cook longer.  It is FANTASTIC!!  Dark brown on the outside and very tender on the inside.
 I also used the same marinade, doubled, and marinated a whole sirloin tip in a huge stainless steel bowl and smoked it with the water pan and it was great too, but only for a crowd!

   6      tablespoons   celery salt
   6      tablespoons   liquid smoke

Reserve your marinade and add olive oil for your mop. I marinated this loin for 36 hours. I also cut it in half because of its size. Cut this recipe for the size of your loin. I also turned it in marinade when I had the chance. I smoked it with apple and hickory and kept the temp between 235 and 250F. This was excellent.

                        ***PART I***
   1      medium        Boston butt
   1      large         onion -- quartered
   2      tablespoons   ground coriander seed
   2      tablespoons   ground cumin seed
   1      tablespoon    oregano
   3                    chipotles in adobo sauce
   2                    bay leaves
   1      can           beer
                        water to cover
                        ***PART II RUB***
                        Dry rub the butt
   5      tablespoons   black pepper
   5      tablespoons   paprika
   1      tablespoon    chili powder
   2      tablespoons   celery salt
   2      teaspoons     dry mustard
   1                    bottle Grandma's chili powder -- (3 oz)
   1      ounce         pasilla chili powder -- (this is a must)
   2      teaspoons     cayenne pepper

Part I.  Combine Part I ingredients in pot and lightly boil for 1 to 2 hours.  Save butt simmer liquid.

Combine rub ingredients.  Remove the butt after 1 to 2 hours cooking and dry rub it with Part II ingredients.

Put butt in a Ziploc bag, in the refrigerator overnight.

Next day fire up your smoker.  I used a Brinkmann "smoke and Grill" with the door on the side, water tray in but no water (foil wrap the water tray).  I smoked the butt with mesquite coals at 250F for about 8 hours.  It depends on whether you want to pull it or cut it--longer if you want to pull it.  Every hour I put foil wrapped mesquite chips on the coals.  I also mopped with the butt liquid every hour just prior to the addition of the chips.

  24                    jalapeno peppers
     1/3  cup           onion -- loosely chopped
   5      tablespoons   cider vinegar
   2      cloves        garlic
   4      tablespoons   ketchup
     1/4  teaspoon      salt
   3      cups          water

I covered and cooked over low-medium heat 1 1/2 hours the above except the chipotles.

Added my Chipotles and cooked another  hour.

If you like you can puree the results.  I freeze mine in  zip lock bags so that it freezes in the shape of a skinny hot dog.  This way you can cut off what you want without having to defrost the whole thing.

NOTES : Thanks to the exchange a while back, I smoked my first chipotles and made adobo sauce for them.  I am now a convert!  Homemade is really better than the canned, they are more "smoky" and more flavorful.  I took about 24 green ( rumor has it that red are even better, but I could not find them) jalapenos and 6 pasillas and smoked them in my Brinkmann (S&G), empty water tray in place, at 225F for 5 hours.  Every hour I added hickory chips wrapped in foil.  I did not dry them but smoked them until most of the green was lost to a dark, wrinkled but not hard exterior.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10      medium        chipotle peppers -- stemmed and slit
     1/3  cup           onion, in 1/2 inch slices
   5      tablespoons   cider vinegar
   2      cloves        garlic -- sliced
   4      tablespoons   ketchup
     1/4  teaspoon      salt

[I cooked all the ingredients except the chipotles for 1  hour or so and then I added the chipotles and cooked for another 1/2 hour]

Combine all of the ingredients in a pan with 3 cups of water. Cover and cook over very low heat for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the chilies are very soft and the liquid has been reduced to 1 cup. [2 cups for me] This recipe will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator in an airtight container.

[I pureed my last batch - it is more convenient] 
For chipotle puree, place the cooked chipotles and sauce in a blender and puree. Put through a fine sieve to remove seeds. 
Makes 1 cup.

   2 1/2  teaspoons     black pepper

Mix and let it sit around for a while before using.

Now, go down to your handy market and get some rolls, say Kaiser rolls (plain) or maybe plain French rolls.  Take your freshly made Q'd and pulled pork and pile it on the bottom half of the roll, then pour several, 3-4 tablespoons to taste, of the vinegar sauce and top with the slaw, maybe nearly as much as the pork.  There is something about the vinegar/slaw-mayo/smoked pork that is unique and wonderfully good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           cornmeal
   2      teaspoons     baking powder
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   1      small         to medium onion, minced
   1                    egg
     1/4  cup           milk or water

Mix together the dry ingredients and the finely cut onion. Break in the egg and beat vigorously. Add the liquid. Form into small patties, round or finger shaped. Drop into smoking fat in which the fish has been fried, until they are a deep brown. Serve hot and at once. Serves 3 or 4

This comes from Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (Pulitzer prize for "The Yearling) " Cross Creek Cookery" (ISBN 0-684-71876-6 Scribner's copyright 1942) and she says:

"Hush-puppies are in a class by themselves. They are a concomitant of the hunt, above all of the fishing trip. Fresh-caught fried fish without hush puppies are as man without woman, a beautiful woman without kindness, law without policeman. The story goes that they derived their name from old fishing and hunting expeditions, when the white folks ate to repletion, the Negro help ate beyond repletion, and the hunting dogs already fed, smelled the delectable odors of human rations and howled for things they scented. Negro cook or white sportsman tossed the remaining cornmeal patties to the dogs, calling, "Hush, puppies!"- and the dogs, devouring them, could ask for no more of life, and hushed."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3  cup           salt
     1/2  cup           plus 2 tablespoons sugar
     1/2  cup           black pepper -- cracked
   1      pinch         dried thyme
  13                    cloves
  13                    allspice -- cracked
   3                    bay leaves
  13                    juniper berries -- crushed
   1      gallon        water

Combine salt, sugar, pepper, thyme, cloves, allspice, bay leaves and juniper berries in saucepan. Add 1 quart water and bring to boil. Simmer 5 minutes, then add to 1 gallon cold water. Chill thoroughly before using brine.

This recipe, inspired by one of Jeremiah Towers', is enough for a 12- to 14-pound turkey. The spicing is very faint, mostly you taste the salt and a bit of the sugar. It's a bit like a very elegant version of commercial smoked turkey, only without the smoke. Peel also uses this recipe for roast pork and smoked fish. For a pork loin, cut all of the amounts by half; for fish or chops, cut them into quarters.

I've been using the following recipe for quite some time, I believe it might be what you're looking for. I found it in the recipe archives, it was originally posted by Mark Antry, whose name I haven't seen on the list for a while. It's excellent.

I make it without the celery seed (and usually add more chili powder and substitute Texas Pete for the Tabasco.

     1/4  cup           olive oil
                        MARTINI MOP (OPTIONAL):
   1      cup           gin
   1      cup           beef stock --
     2/3  cup           water
                        juice of one lemon
   2      tablespoons   olive oil

The night before, prepare paste.  In food processor, combine the onion, garlic lemon, gin and salt and process to combine.  Continue processing, pouring in the oil until a thin paste forms.

Generously spread the paste on the lamb.  Place lamb in plastic bag and refrigerate overnight
.
Prepare smoker bringing temp. to 200-220F.  Remove meat from icebox let sit at room temp. for 30 min. Mix mop (if you plan to baste) and warm over low heat.

Transfer lamb to smoker.  Cook 35-40 min./lb. until internal temp. is 145F for rare-med. rare.  Baste meat w/mop every 45-50 min. in wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style smoker.
Remove lamb and let sit 10 min. 
Slice and serve warm or chilled.

TIP:  Leg of lamb is best when lightly smoked... in a water smoker.  But other types will yield pleasing results.  If using a wood-burning pit, wrap the lamb in foil after the first hour!

TIP:  Use coarse kosher salt.  The mild flavor won't over-power the
dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           olive oil
   4      cloves        garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
   1      tablespoon    minced fresh rosemary or thyme
     1/4  cup           lemon juice
                        black pepper, freshly ground

Heat olive oil in a small saucepan.  Add garlic and rosemary and let cook over low heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes.  Strain oil through a sieve.  Add lemon juice and pepper and stir to mix. 
Makes enough marinade for 1 chicken, butterflied or cut into parts. Marinate 3-4 hours.

This is similar to the beef marinade but uses lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar. Chicken is more delicate, so I use less garlic and rosemary.

Here's the high-point of the Cooks Illustrated article on Pulled Pork

Preparing pulled pork requires little effort, but lots of time.  Plan on nine hours from start to finish: three hours with the spice rub, three hours on the grill, two hours in the oven, and one hour to rest.  To give the meat its characteristic smoky flavor, use either hickory chips that you've wrapped in foil pouches or add one medium to large chunk of hickory.  We prefer one chunk, even though it has to be soaked in water for at least one hour, whereas the chips do not require soaking.  If you do this with the chip pouches, the number will determine how strong a smoky flavor you get: One pouch is detectable, two noticeable, and three assertive.  Serve the pulled pork on plain white bread or warmed buns with the classic accompaniments of dill pickle chips and coleslaw.

1.  If using a fresh ham, remove skin.  Massage dry rub into meat.  Wrap tightly in double layer of plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 3 hours, but no longer than 72 hours.

2.  At 1 hour prior to cooking, remove roast from refrigerator to stand at room temperature.  Soak hickory chunk or assemble hickory chip pouches by wrapping a large handful of wood chips in each of one to three 12-inch squares of foil.  Prick each foil pack with fork tines to allow smoke to escape.  Meanwhile, ignite enough charcoal to fill slightly less than two shoeboxes, and burn until completely covered with thin coating light gray ash, 20 to 30 minutes.

3.  Open bottom grill vents and arrange hot colas into two equal piles on opposite sides of grill, place chunk or pouch(es) directly on one pile of coals and set grill rack in place.  Set unwrapped roast in disposable pan and place on rack between two piles of coal.  Open grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, turning lid so that vents are opposite chunk or pouch(es) to draw smoke through and around roast.  Cook, adding fifteen to twenty briquettes every 30 to 40 minutes or seven to ten pieces lump charcoal every 15 to 20 minutes, along with additional pouches (if using), until smoke flavor has fully permeated meat, about 3 hours.

4.  Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325F.  Place roast in pan and wrap with foil to cover completely.  Place pan in oven and bake until meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.

5.  Put foil-wrapped roast in pan into double grocery bag.  Crimp top shut; let rest 1 hour.  Transfer roast to cutting board and unwrap.  When cool enough to handle, "pull" pork by separating roast into muscle sections, removing fat if desired, and tearing meat into thin shreds with fingers.

Place shredded meat in large bowl; toss with 1 cup barbecue sauce, adding more to taste.  Serve with remaining sauce passed separately.  SPICY CHILLI RUB (Makes 1 cup): Mix all ingredients in small bowl.

EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA-STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE (Makes 2 cups): Adapted from a recipe in Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby's "The Thrill of the Grill" (Morrow, 1990), this is a classic pepper spiked vinegar sauce.  Mix all ingredients, including salt and pepper, to taste, in medium bowl.

MID-SOUTH CAROLINA MUSTARD SAUCE (Makes 2-1/2 cups): The pulled pork tossed in this mustard sauce was the hands-down favorite at a recent party.  Though we prefer the flavor of Dijon mustard in this sauce, feel free to substitute other mustards to suit your taste.  Mix all ingredients, including pepper to taste, in medium bowl.

WESTERN SOUTH CAROLINA-STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE (Makes 2 cups): Serves originally at Mama Rosa's, along-time barbecue pit restaurant in North Philadelphia, this recipe is adapted from Jim Tarantino's outstanding book "Marinades" (Crossing Press, 1992).  Heat oil in 2-quart saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic; sauté until softened, 4-5 minutes.  Stir in all the remaining ingredients except ketchup; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, then add ketchup.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes.

   3      whole         medium tomatoes
     1/2  medium        sweet white onion -- cut in chunks
   3      whole         jalapenos -or-
   6      whole         serranos (for a hotter salsa)
   3      cloves        garlic
     3/4  teaspoon      salt -- or to taste
   1      teaspoon      red wine vinegar
   2      teaspoons     vegetable oil
     1/2  cup           water

This recipe is adapted from one that appears in Matt Martinet's Culinary Frontier: A Real Texas Cookbook by Matt Martinez, Jr. and Steve Fate (Doubleday, 1997).

It's great with chips, but it's heavenly with barbecue, steaks, and scrambled eggs. If you don't have a smoker, a barbecue pit will do.

Combine ingredients in a heavy pot, and place the pot (uncovered) in a smoker for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the vegetables are soft. (Do not allow the sauce to become dry; add more water if needed.) Remove pot from smoker.

Mash (do not blend) the vegetables, taking care to mash one chili at a time until salsa tastes hot enough; discard any extra chilies. (Salsa will be chunky.) Adjust the salt to taste. Store in an airtight container in refrigerator (will keep about 2 weeks). Yield: 2 cups.

Note: For a thicker salsa, combine 1 Tbs. cornstarch with 2 Tbs. water, and drizzle the mixture into the salsa while it's still hot. Simmer on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes until salsa reaches the desired thickness. If it becomes too thick, simply add a bit more water.

   1      cup           brown sugar
   1                    lemon -- juice of
   1      teaspoon      red pepper
   1      teaspoon      black pepper
   1      teaspoon      dry mustard
     1/2  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      onion powder
     1/2  teaspoon      oregano
     1/2  teaspoon      allspice
     1/2  teaspoon      ginger
     1/2  teaspoon      basil

Mix all ingredients in a saucepan and simmer for 1 hour. Let sauce stand for 2 hours before serving on the side with barbecue.

The thing about this recipe is that it will depend on your smoker or grill and the size of your ribs. Memphis barbecue is over an extremely low fire so that the meat cooks very slowly. If you cannot do this on your grill, you'll have to adjust your cooking time accordingly. This is the original recipe and the time to cook it in a smoker is approximately 6 hours. However, I cannot do this on my grill because it's a gas grill and it's too hot. This is what I do. I place the ribs on one side of the grill only, I turn the burner on the other half of the grill on low. I place a smoker box over the flame with wood chips. Using this method, I can stretch out the cooking time to about 2 hours max. But it's worth the fuss. The ribs are so moist and falling apart on the inside with a nice crust on the outside.

One more piece of advice. If you have a small grill and are doing a lot of meat for a big gang, here is something I do in that situation. I cook everything in batches until nearly done, then transfer to baking pans and keep in warm oven while I start the next batch. Since the majority of cooking was done on the grill, the effect is the same. Also, seal the pans of ribs with foil when you put in the oven; grilled ribs dry out quickly in the oven.

The center of mid-South barbecue, Memphis offers a range of sauces that take the high middle ground between Eastern and Western styles.  Like this version, they are often medium-bodied mixtures, moderate in sweet, heat, and everything else except taste.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onions and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the onions begin to turn golden.  Stir in the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the mixture thickens, approximately 20 minutes.  Stir frequently.

Use the sauce warm.  It keeps, refrigerated, for a couple of weeks.

* skinless, boneless, about 1/2 lb. each, halved 
** the rind, pith, and membrane cut away with a serrated knife and discarded and the fruit chopped, reserving any juice. 
In a ceramic or glass bowl, combine the oil, garlic, coriander, thyme, scallions, and the chicken breasts.  Let them marinate, chilled, for at least 8 hours or overnight.  In a saucepan, cook the shallots and the ginger in the butter over a moderately low heat, stirring, until the shallots are softened.  Add the chopped lemons, limes, and oranges with all the reserved juices and simmer the mixture for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to a syrup-like consistency.  Add the broth, increase the heat to moderate, and boil the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is reduced by 1/3.  Mix the cornstarch and water together.  Stir in the cornstarch mixture, simmer the sauce for 30 seconds, and strain through a fine sieve into a bowl.  Add the Grand Marnier, the white pepper, and salt to taste.  Remove the chicken from the marinade and let it stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Grill the chicken on a rack set about 5 inches above the mesquite, turning it once, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until it is just cooked through.  Transfer the chicken to a platter, spoon the sauce over it, and garnish the platter with lemon wedges.

You can boil this if desired, but it not strictly necessary. Just give it a good stir before you use it each time. I keep it in a ceramic-on-steel ($4.95 at Wal-Mart and the wife doesn't give me any grief!!) pot on the pit so it good and hot.

In South Carolina, folks used to baste with salt water and little more. Naturally, that tended to result in a rather salty product, but that basic flavor has been handed down through generations. We don't even know what health food is down here, so we think salt is good for ya!

I often add dry mustard to my mop, especially if I'm doing just ribs. It's become one of those things that is whatever-you-have-on-hand. I've added ground celery seed (not good), oregano (OK), basil (OK), dill seed (OK in limited quantities), turmeric (not good), cayenne (OK) and any number of different sauces and such. But, basically, I start with this:

    By some miraculous feat, I have survived my trip to CA and Mexico.  Barely, but I lived to tell about it.  I ended up getting a seemingly life threatening case of the Mexican El Gotcha Gringo Flu!  It makes for an interesting plane ride, but I wouldn't recommend it as a hobby. 8^)

While I was down there I mistakenly got on the wrong bus that took me up in to the hills instead of back to the marina.  While on this fifteen cent tour of the local jungle roads, a truly bumpy, death defying experience, I was treated to an amazing culinary delight.

While trying desperately to find someone on the bus who spoke English to tell the driver that I didn't want to die out here, and wanted to go back to town, my nose caught a wisp of familiarity in the air.  I had detected the faint, delightful aroma of pork mixed with what I thought was the smoke from mesquite.  The locals on the bus thought that that I was "loco" by the child-like grin that came across my face, and the way that I kept sniffing the air trying to find where that delightful smell was coming from.

My attempts to try and get back to town had now turned into "Where's that smell coming from, and can you get me there?"  For some reason, they understood that part. As the bus made it's way through the jungle the aroma got stronger.  By the time that I saw the actual smoke rising above the trees, I must have looked pretty crazed to the locals.  I guess that my size, 6'4" 400 lbs., gave them the impression that if I didn't get to that pig soon, their lives may be in danger!  A few of them had begun what I assumed to be cheering on the driver to get there, "pronto!" 
When the bus rounded the corner to where the smoke was rising, I got my first glimpse of what was going on.  The bus driver started saying something to me as he stopped the bus and opened the doors for me to get off.  Which for reasons still unclear to me, I did.  Along with two of the other passengers.  The bus driver slammed the doors and took off up the road, laughing as he drove off.  Not a good feeling to say the least.

The two folks who got off with me, said something to me and motioned for me to go with them over to where the cooking was going on.  At this point it dawned on me that I'm miles up in the mountains where no one knows where I am, following people I don't know, to for what all I know is some sort of ritualistic sacrificial tourist feast!  All I'm thinking is, "I wonder if they have a dipping sauce?"

This area where they were cooking this pig in a pit was some sort of communal eating area.  This pig that was being cooked was to celebrate the release of one of the local men from prison.  Apparently he had been falsely accused by a tourist for a crime that he really didn't commit, and spent two years locked up for it.  I can't tell you how proud I was to be a tourist in there land at that point.  Even so, I was graciously welcomed into their party, even when I tried to bow out of it, and started to walk back to town.

They insisted that I stay and eat with them.      I had never experienced anything quite like that before.  When they brought that pig up out of the ground, I darned near cried.  My nose and taste buds were just having a field day!  When they served me up a plate of that pig along with some of the veggies that they had cooked with it, I was ready to move in permanently!  I have never tasted anything so good in my life!  It was just fantastic! 
From what I could gather, they had prepared the pig by rubbing it down with a mixture of mangos, an assortment of peppers, salt, and stuffed it with sugar cane, and veggies.  All of this plus a rather healthy dowsing of tequila.  They said that the tequila was more for the pigs pleasure than anything else. 
The pig had been cooking for about a day and a half.  Did fortune smile upon me, or what?  I got there about 45 minutes before they dug that pig up.

 Oh, BTW.  As if the pig wasn't enough to send me into hog heaven, I was treated to another local delicacy.  Iguana.  Yep!  One of them lizard like things.  I guess that up in the hills it is considered as much a staple as chicken.  I must admit that I had trouble getting it down once they told me what it was that I was smacking my lips on.  But all in all, it tasted pretty darn good!  They joked about one day having a Kentucky Fried Iguana stand!  I'm not sure if the colonel is ready for that.

 In case you're wondering how I got back to town, about two hours later the same bus came back by on his way back to town and stopped to pick me up.  The bus driver just laughed at me as I waddled back on to the bus, rubbing my belly and smiling from ear to ear.  My family didn't even notice how long I had been gone when I got back.  When I told them of my great adventure, they just smiled and said, "yeah.  Right!"  I think that I'm the only one who truly enjoyed our stay, and can't wait to go back again.  It was even worth the El Gotcha Gringo Flu!

                        pork ribs
   4      teaspoons     minced garlic
   3      tablespoons   sugar
   5      tablespoons   Koon Chun Thick Soy Sauce
     1/3  cup           Koon Chun Hoisin Sauce
     1/2  cup           Shaohsing Chinese Wine
   2      tablespoons   Koon Chun ground bean sauce
                        GLAZE:
   2      tablespoons   honey
   2      teaspoons     sesame seed oil
   3      tablespoons   thin soy sauce

I take all the marinade ingredients and put into a bowl.  I heat it up slightly so all the ingredients combine.  I add a little cornstarch and water to thicken it up a little.  I find it sticks to the ribs better this way.

I put the ribs and marinade in a pan big enough to contain full racks. Being as dedicated as I am, I cover and refrigerate for a week.  I also remove and switch around the ribs twice a day so all the ribs are well marinated.  I don't like using a plastic bag here since the marinating drying slightly on the ribs works better.

I get my grill hot.  I use almond/apple/maple at a 50/30/20 ratio.  I hot smoke the ribs for about 1.5 to 2.5 hours.  The temperature gets to about 200 to 225F.  I also brush the marinade several times while cooking.

After ribs are done, I brush the with the glaze.  I scale up the ratios here as well.  I am more generous with the honey and less with the sesame seed oil.  I use just enough to give a hint of the oil flavor.  I sprinkle ribs with sesame seeds just before serving. I usually serve with a good quantity of Thai Fried Rice or Yang Chow Fried Rice.  I also like Cantonese stir fried Brussel sprouts of Szechwan green beans.

                        ***BATTER***
   6      cups          self rising flour
   2      cups          Aunt Jemima Corn Meal Mix
   6                    eggs -- separated
     1/2  gallon        buttermilk
   1      tablespoon    onion powder
   2      tablespoons   garlic powder
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
   2      tablespoons   paprika
                        peanut oil
                        ***STUFFING***
   2      cans          whole jalapeno peppers -- (1 gallon )
   1      pound         ground beef
   1      pound         ground sausage
   1      cup           Monetary Jack cheese -- shredded
   1      cup           sharp cheddar cheese -- shredded
   1                    yellow onion -- chopped

Mix all dry batter ingredients in a very, very large bowl. Then blend the egg yolks with the buttermilk and stir into dry ingredients until pancake batter consistency is reached. Beat the egg-whites and fold into the batter. Stuffing: Sauté the onion in a little butter until done, then fry up the ground beef and sausage together with the onion until brown, then pour into colander and drain, but don't let the meat get too dry. Mix in the shredded cheeses. Now you re ready to start stuffin them peppers. Drain the peppers from the can, then wash them real good. Cut each pepper open and remove the seeds. Stuff the little puppies! When you get them all stuffed, set in freezer for about an hour. This will help stuffing stick together when you place it in the batter. After they have set in the freezer about an hour start dipping them in the batter, and fry in deep fryer at about 350F. When each one is golden brown, remove and place on paper towel.

   1      teaspoon      hot red pepper sauce
                        (Texas Pete or Tabasco)
   1      cup           vegetable oil
   2      teaspoons     salt
   1      dash          ground black pepper

                        jalapenos

I did some a couple of weeks ago, and it's worked fine.  I used a mixture of peach and hickory; I smoked them for about 8-9 hours then let the fire go out. I finished them in my dehydrator then next morning, though I understand that fresh smoked jalapenos are also good (i.e., not smoked to complete dryness, and stored in the freezer).  I've got a second batch that I'll do this weekend using a different technique (well, red jalapenos are only $1/lb at the farmer's market!) suggested in the Chipotle Cookbook (think that's the title).  I've frozen a bag of jalapenos, and will pull them out and smoke them - apparently they collapse and caramelize more, giving a somewhat sweeter, smoky taste.  I just do it in a typical small water smoker, but I've also smoked stuff in a Weber (small fire on one side, pan of water under grill).  I forget the temperature I used (probably around 160F).  They suggested that the chilies absorb all the smoke they are going to in 4-6 hours.  I also did some serranos and Fresno's at the same time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      tablespoon    ground cumin
   1      tablespoon    thyme
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1 1/2  teaspoons     black pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder

Mix ingredients.  Remove membrane from underside of ribs. Apply the rub liberally.  Cook at about 200 F till done.  I usually do one rack on the hibachi if dining alone.  I use enough coals to line the perimeter of the unit and keep the ribs centered to avoid flareups and to prolong the cooking time. Try to keep fire cool enough to allow an hour or two of cooking time.  If doing in the smoker, I might extend the cooking time to three hours or so.

Serve with BBQ sauce on the side, but I find the rub imparts a great flavor and sauce is not needed.

     1/2  cup           hot water
                        honey

Sauté the onions and garlic in the olive oil over medium heat until soft.  Add the chipotles, adobo sauce, tomato sauce and the bouillon dissolved in the 1/2 cup of hot water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until you have a thick sauce.

Allow the sauce to cool somewhat, then puree in a blender until smooth.  If I want a sweeter taste, I will add about 1/4 cup honey to the mixture while still in the blender and mix.  Do the lick the spoon test to see if it is sweet enough for whatever you will be using the sauce on.  You can always add more honey, but you can't take it out.

                        fill to line with whole milk

This recipe is similar to Danny's but has Eagle Brand milk in it. I think this is what makes it special and also expensive. If your not familiar with Eagle Brand it is made by Bordens and is a condensed sweetened milk. You have to spoon it from the can and it is very rich. This recipe also has eggs. It is for vanilla but we have added all kinds of fresh fruits and nuts. They all work.

   2      tablespoons   bacon fat

     1/4  cup           Crystal hot sauce
   1      tablespoon    Worcestershire sauce
     1/2  teaspoon      cayenne

Sauté the onions, celery, and garlic until the onions are soft and
clear. Add the rest of the ingredients in any order you care to. I like to let this simmer for 4 or 5 hours. It has a nice, rich dark red color and works well as a finishing sauce. My wife likes me to a few cups off and add some liquid smoke to it so she can dip her potato chips in it or whatever else she can think of to put it on.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    24 ounce loaf Italian Bread
     1/2  pound         margarine
   2      packages      Lipton Onion Soup Mix
   2      tablespoons   granulated onion
   1      tablespoon    granulated garlic
   1      pound         American cheese -- sliced thin

On a cutting board, slice bread in one-inch slices *almost* all the way through.  Try seriously not to slice all the way through. Transfer the loaf en toto to a piece of foil large enough to completely wrap it in a drug-store wrap.

Melt margarine in a 4-cup measuring cup in the microwave.  Add the soup, onion, and garlic.  Stir well to combine.

Baste the insides of the bread slices with the margarine, the goop will stay in the bottom.  Go back and baste each slice with the goop.

Fold each slice of cheese in a triangle (like a flag) and insert 1 whole slice in each bread slice.

Wrap the loaf and reserve until brisket is done.  Bake for 20 minutes in a medium oven.

This stuff is great and rich.  Three slices equals a meal without anything else.

Recipe amendments:

I forgot to warn you to microwave the margarine and then add the soup mix.  If you microwave the soup mix it turns to a plastic sludge.

I forgot to mention to reserve a bit of the drained goop in the bottom of the measuring cup and spread it on the top of the loaf.  When it bakes up it turns crunchy--kinda like an onion-garlic praline.

Here is the recipe for mock-Bufalo Chipotle Sauce as originally posted to the BBQ List by Carey Starzinger, cicra 1996.  Additional thanks go to Kit Anderson who found and re-posted it last fall.  (If the Chipotles in adobo sauce is not available to you locally, many mail order outfits can supply--Herdez brand is good)

(Carey):

"I have been quite fortunate in being able to taste something and come pretty darn close to duplicating it.  Many times the ingredients seem strange, but the flavor is very close to the original.  Here is my copy-cat flavor-wise of Bufalo (sic) Chipotle Sauce."

Blenderize thoroughly.  Heat thoroughly, bring to a boil, simmer until the desired thickness is obtained.  If you are using the canned chipotles as the recipe calls for, you may can in a water bath canner for 15 minutes using 1/2 pint jars.

To blender, add almonds, banana, cinnamon, garlic, tortillas, sesame seeds, pine nuts and 1 cup of the chicken broth.  Whirl until pureed.  (Sauce will be grainy.)

Pour into a pan; add  butter or margarine, chocolate, and remaining chicken broth.  Heat to a simmer, stirring.  Season to taste with salt if necessary.

  30                    corn husks, trimmed
                        ***TAMALE FILLING***
   1      pound         beef
   1      pound         pork
   1      large         onion
   1      tablespoon    salt
   2                    garlic
   2      tablespoons   chile powder
   3      tablespoons   fat
   2      tablespoons   flour
   5      cups          broth; from cooking meat
                        ***MASA***
   2 1/2  cups          masa or scalded corn meal
     1/2  cup           fat
   2      tablespoons   chile powder
                        salt
   1                    batch meat broth

Prepare Husks: Trim smaller end square and remove silks. Soak in boiling water for 1 hr. Husks should be 6 or 7 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide or larger.

Prepare Meat: Boil meat, onion, garlic and salt in enough water to cover meat until very tender. Drain broth and save. Run meat through chopper and season with chile powder and additional salt to taste. (We prefer meat to have slightly more consistency so we simply finely shred meat instead of running through chopper) Melt fat in pan and add flour. Heat until flour browns, stirring constantly. Add meat mixture and enough broth to make meat mixture like very thick gravy. Cook for 15 minutes.

Prepare Dough: Scald masa with remaining meat broth. If you don't have enough broth, you can use water or additional canned broth. Add salt and add chile powder until masa turns slightly pink. Mix thoroughly.

Prepare tamales: Spread masa onto shuck beginning at the top and enough to bend over. Spread as thick as you like. After smoothing masa on the shuck, put some of the meat mixture down the middle and roll like a cigarette. Steam tamales for 1 1/2 to 2 hrs. in a large pot with elevated rack high enough to keep tamales out of the water. Tamales are done when the shuck peels easily away from the masa without sticking. Yield: 30 tamales

Finished transcribing this recipe handed down from my grandmother. It's been in use, possibly with slight enhancements, for 40 or 50 years at least. Add a Q twist to it by wrapping about a dozen cooked tamales (2x6) and tying with strips of corn shuck and then putting them in the smoker for an hour or so. Also use smoked meat instead of plain. Would be a great way to use up odds and ends from smoked leftovers.

>>I am new to the group and have a request.  I remember from back near "the dawn of time" the early 1970s when I was in the US Navy and stationed in the Philippine Islands.  There was a substance that was somewhat disparagingly referred to as "monkey meat" that was sold along the street out side the bars.  I know it was usually a pork BBQ.  I have tried to get the exact flavor but have not quite made it yet.

If anyone has a recipe I would certainly appreciate a response.

If my memory is not failing I remember it was biased on soy sauce, lemon juice and MSG.  Cooked on a wooden skewer over a charcoal grill.<<

As luck would have it, my mother-in-law is from the Philippines, and happens to be visiting right now.

According to her, the pork is sliced, and then marinated in 7-up. That's right, 7-up.  She says that if you want, you can add a little garlic and/or onion to the marinade.  The pork is then skewered and grilled, basting with soy sauce while cooking.  The MSG is an ingredient that I'd add, but may not be for everyone.

It sounds bizarre, but the 7-up would give a citrusy taste like the lemon juice you mentioned.

   1      quart         Worcestershire sauce
   1      pint          vinegar
   4      quarts        beef bone stock
   1      pint          vegetable oil
   3      tablespoons   MSG -- (optional)

To make bone stock, but stout beef bones and boil them.  Add all the other ingredients to bone stock and let stand overnight in the refrigerator before using.

Use this mop to rub over meats or to baste them while cooking.  The flavor will change and improve during use, for you are constantly transferring smooth and grease from the meats back to the mop concoction.  Keep leftover mop refrigerated.

   2      pounds        dry beans, Great Northern or Navy
   1                    meaty ham bone -- or several hocks
     1/4  cup           molasses
   1      cup           catsup
   2      tablespoons   vinegar

   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/4  cup           pepper

Soak dry beans overnight (my family uses Great Northern). You can dramatically reduce the methane factor by changing the water once or twice during the soaking process. Drain and rinse the beans, put them in a 5 qt. pot, and cover generously with water. Add all ingredients to the pot and simmer until the beans are tender. You can speed this process up by using a pressure cooker. DO NOT fill the pressure cooker more than half full! Cook for 45 minutes at 15 lb. Pressure. After the pressure come down by itself, or the beans are boiled tender, remove the ham bone, cut up the meat, and return it to the pot. You can add salt at this point, if necessary, and make sure there is enough water. Put the beans in an oven-proof bowl and bake at 350F for an hour or more.

Take a 2 to 21/2 pound catfish, gut and remove horns and fins leave the head.  Get some clay and make two plates 3/4" thick by 6"X12" or as big as your fish.  The clay should be fairly loose.  Push your catfish into the clay firmly so as to indent into the clay.  Take your other plate and put over top of fish and squeeze the ends together all around.  Making sure all seams are sealed .  Now and this is important, take a 1/4" stick and punch a hole threw the clay and into the fish, if you don't it will explode. 
Next have a fire with at least 1 foot of coals in it.  Put the plate in the coals with your hole up important.  Make sure you have at least 3" of coals over your plate at all times.  Leave in fire for 2 to 2 1/2 hours and then remove.  Take your plate turn it up to you at 90 degrees and take a knife and pop open where the seam was.  The skin of the catfish should be stuck to the one half of the plate leaving the fish in the other plate.  Now if your generous you can take half of the fish and put it in the plate with the skin in it and share.  Serves Two Says he likes to put wild scallions in the catfish when he does this.  Oh and he said he likes Indiana mud the best but any will do even Montana Mud, so were all in luck.  Why don't you folks at the Q-Fest do this.  Lots a shits and giggles.

Kebabs of all types, sizes, and shapes are standard in Afghan cooking for both Jews and Muslims. They are easily assembled and probably most basic recipes of all cooking, stretching back to earliest, primitive times. I saw two workman barbecuing their lamb kebabs over a few twigs in an open field, resting skewers on a thick branch cut from a nearby tree, and turning them every now and then. They then wrapped a piece of Afghan bread around skewer and pulled off crisp brown meat.

1. Mix everything together and marinate at room temperature for a minimum of 1 hour or preferably in refrigerator overnight.

2. Put 4 or 5 cubes of chicken, without onion, on each metal skewer and broil over charcoal for 10 or 15 minutes.

3. Serve hot with Afghan bread, salad, and pickles.

NOTE: My Afghan mentor related that turmeric was much used in Afghanistan in many ways and had a great reputation for its health-giving properties. It is reputed to cleanse the blood, and a little turmeric in ones morning milk would a provide day of good health.

NOTES : Here is the recipe which caused my eventual downfall. I know it says NC and the North Carolina boys don't use mustard, but this is the way I got it off of the internet years ago. I was in North Carolina when I was 14 years old and BBQ was the last thing from my mind. Maybe the NC stands for something else I don't know but the sauce is great on pork, beef, weenies, boot leather, just about any thing. I was let out on a work release this weekend and made a quick Q; smoked ham, resmoked with hickory for about an hour at roasting temps, and served with green beans and potatoes boiled in beer and a avocado salad. The sauce was excellent on the ham and beans. It gets better with age.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    10 pound Beef Brisket
                        SEASONING MIXTURE:
   2      tablespoons   salt
   2 1/2  tablespoons   sugar
   3      tablespoons   brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   ground cumin
   2      tablespoons   chili powder
   2      tablespoons   coarse ground black pepper
     1/4  tablespoon    cayenne pepper
   2      tablespoons   paprika

With the help of this list, especially Mike on the smoking and using the oven, and some innovation of my own I have used a method for cooking briskets several times that has always resulted in meat that ranged in taste from fantastic to BBQ from heaven.  When I have taken this to parties and eat-ins people who do not even know me or know I cooked it routinely brag about the meat.

This method is for the following cooks:

1.  You like to smoke briskets but need it to fit your schedule of when you want to serve for eating instead of when you have time to spend 1+ days smoking.

2.  Want to take your delicacy to eat-ins at work, social lunches and dinners, be a friend to someone who is ill or had a recent tragedy in their life, or just want to eat BBQ without having to eat all that smoke at the same time.

3.  Want BBQ with a little different twang.

The following is for a 10 pound briskets (1 or more). Adjust time for different sizes.  I buy the meat a day or so before smoking and place it in the refrigerator.  I do not freeze meat before smoking but if you must it is OK.

Pre Rub (optional):  I say optional because I have eliminated this step and cannot tell any difference but if time permits I usually do it from overnight to several days ahead of smoking for insurance.  Use most any recipe on the list - there are many good ones.

Smoke:  Ideally, I smoke, meat side down, at least 6 hours at 200F using oak and a little mesquite at the beginning and end of process.  Just be careful not too let the wood smolder and get a bitter taste if you use all wood.  Otherwise this method is pretty forgiving.  Charcoal and wood chips a minimum of once an hour will do just as good.  I think any grill or smoker that has a lid and enough room to offset the heat from the meat will suffice.  Even if it gets a little too cool or warm once in a while the meat will survive. 
Freeze as needed: I take the meat off the smoker with oven mitts in order not to pierce meat and place on wide tin foil, meat side down, on the counter.  After it cools a little while I wrap each brisket in foil (use wide foil but it still may take 2 pieces), place in plastic bags (optional) and put in freezer while still warm.

Oven cook as needed:  The day before I want to serve I get a brisket out of the freezer, place frozen in a pan or dish, meat side down, unwrap the top of the foil so the top fat side of brisket is exposed.  I leave the brisket on the foil with the foil sides sticking up.  I cook overnight, 14 hours, at 200F.  I use an oven thermometer to adjust the oven (best $5 investment I ever made).  Most ovens will not stay at one temperature. Mine gets down to about 180F and the heating element turns on until it gets to about 215F.  Just the slightest movement in the dial will result in too much or too little heat for that long of cooking time.  If it is a fatty brisket I pour off the grease several times as it fits my schedule.  Sorry you serious smokers, I do not lose much sleep over my cooking.  I usually do not bother if it is a trimmed brisket.  Oh, just cook 12 hours if you eliminate the freezing. 
Terrific smell:  The great aroma while cooking is just a free extra.  If you do not fill your home with a light BBQ smell then you probably did not get enough smoke.  Do not worry.  It will be good any way.

Seasoning recipe:  Mix seasoning ingredients in a snap or zip and seal plastic bag.  You will need to expel the extra air before you seal and work the brown sugar in the bag so it mixes with the other ingredients.  It will tend to clump if you do not do this.  Mix very thoroughly.

Apply seasoning:  Remove meat from oven 30 minutes to 2 hours before cooking time is complete.  I cannot tell that timing is too critical. Pour off the grease and using the mitts turn the meat fat side down in pan, meat side up.  Quickly as possibly sprinkle a heavy coat of the seasoning on the meat side.  I have never measured how much I use.  I have never applied too much but have applied too little.  Be liberal with the seasoning.

Finish cooking:  Fold the foil edges over the meat. Remember, the brisket is meat side up now for the first time.  Get a fresh piece of foil and place over meat and fold edges over pan.    A perfect seal is not necessary.  Just be sure the meat is not exposed.  Place back in oven and finish cooking for the remaining time.

Done? Now Slice:  Place some paper bags on counter to soak up splattered or spilled grease and place cutting board on paper.  Using mitts take brisket and place meat side up on board.  Using a fork or knife, carefully check meat for tenderness.  If it is not obviously tender, rewrap and cook 2 more hours.  If it passes the tenderness test and you are ready to slice, turn meat fat side up.  With a long knife or spatula scrape off the excess top fat, which should come off easily, and discard.  Turn meat side up again, slice against grain with sharp knife only and serve now if you must.

Appealing Meat Dish:  Here is what I do for a very appealing meat dish. I use an electric fillet knife and uniformly slice the meat against the grain being careful not to disturb the shape of the brisket.  I take half the brisket and slide it off the board onto a fresh piece of foil and wrap meat, (may take two pieces of foil).  Do the same with the other half.

Prepare for serving later:  Place the wrapped meat back in the oven at 200F (hope you did not turn oven off) just long enough to heat the meat throughout. Take the wrapped packages of meat and immediately place in a small insulated chest.  You way want to wrap in paper so the heat will not damage the chest and for better insulation.  It will keep warm for hours.  Take it to your party, give to a friend in need or serve to your own guests and you will be the star. The meat seems to be better after this waiting process.

This sounds more complicated than it is.  It really is an easy process and you can do all your smoking for several briskets at one time and enjoy the results for months.  Also, have one in the freezer for those unexpected occasions.

Mix all ingredients. Pour the batter into a greased cast iron skillet.

Bake at 400F in oven for 45 minutes; cool slightly, slice like a pie, and serve.

For those who don't want or have the time to prepare from scratch, I
have had excellent results by using 2 packages of cornbread mix (the kind in a tear open envelope, not the box) prepared as on the package, then stirring in the cream corn, green chile, and cheese just before pouring it into the skillet. Use the same oven temp and cooking time as described above ( the time indicated on the package needs to be increased because of the added ingredients.

Marinate in the fridge for a good long while.  A week isn't too long.  Grill in a Webber kettle with the lid on and the vents almost closed, 15-20 minutes on each side.

A leg of lamb is great for a crowd.  Because the thickness is quite uneven, some parts will be well done while others are medium rare.  Who says you can't please all the people all the time!

  28      ounces        Heinz Ketchup
     1/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce

     1/2  teaspoon      marjoram
                        ***PART II***
   1 1/4  cups          white vinegar
   1 1/2  cups          water
   1      cup           dark brown sugar
   1      cup           white sugar
     1/4  cup           olive oil
     1/4  cup           margarine
   1      tablespoon    Louisiana hot sauce

Part I directions: * Add the Worcestershire sauce to clean out the bottle.  ** The flavor of Mexican is much different than Mediterranean oregano.

KEY: Combine Part I ingredients and reduce to about one half original volume -thick and gooey.  This may take about 5 hours.  Cover the pan with a splatter screen or you'll be sorry.  Just before proceeding with Part II, remove the bulk ingredients (lemon, orange and larger pieces of diced tomato) by straining through a French fry basket.  Add Part II ingredients.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Continue cooking to reduce the sauce to desired consistency.  This is actually a dipping sauce and should be thinner than regular BBQ sauce.  Serve very "HOT" on the side for dipping, or pour generously over ribs, butterfly pork loins or chicken.

Categories    : Bbq List                         Mexican
                Sides

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      quarts        water
   2      quarts        dried corn
   5      tablespoons   slaked lime CaOH

Nixtamal is dried field corn soaked in, and heated in, a solution of slaked lime and water.  Slaked lime, calcium hydroxide, is generally available in the form of "builder's lime" -- not to be confused with unslaked lime, calcium oxide.  Unslaked lime can't be used for making nixtamal unless you slake it first by adding it to water, allowing it to bubble and then stand for a bit, and then using the WATER for processing the dried corn.  It's the lime, by the way, that contributes to the unique taste and texture of corn tortillas.  After the corn has soaked for the required length of time (depending on whether making nixtamal for masa or pozole), it's rinsed to remove the lime and then rubbed to remove the husks.

Mix lime and water in a large, non reactive (enamel or stainless steel) pot.  Place pot over high heat and stir until lime is dissolved.  Add corn and, stirring occasionally, bring to a boil.  If making nixtamal for masa to make tortillas, boil for a couple of minutes, remove from heat, cover and let soak overnight.  If making nixtamal to make masa for tamales, boil for about 15 minutes, remove from heat, cover and let soak for a couple of hours.  If making nixtamal for pozole, boil for 15 minutes and let soak for another 5 to 10 minutes.  After soaking for the desired length of time, rinse the corn in a colander to remove all traces of the lime while rubbing the kernels to remove the softened hulls.  Once cleaned, the nixtamal can then be ground into masa or left whole to be further simmered until tender to make hominy for pozole or menudo.

Making tortillas using fresh masa or masa harina...

Masa harina is fresh masa that's been dried and then ground into a flour-like consistency, to make masa harina you must first make masa. Masa harina is similar to, but not the same as, fine ground cornmeal. Trying to make corn tortillas out of regular cornmeal, even finely ground, would probably be unsatisfying.  I suppose it would be possible to make nixtamal for tortillas, grind it into masa, dry it, grind it again and then re-hydrate it to make tortillas.  But why not just make fresh masa from nixtamal and then make tortillas with it. Both nixtamal and masa can be frozen for later use.

If you wanted to be authentic, you could use a metate (a flat stone made from lava rock) and mano (sorta like a flattened, oval shaped rolling pin also made from lava rock) to grind the corn into masa...but a plate-style grain mill is a lot easier.  My hand cranked Corona brand does double duty...I not only use it for masa but also for grinding grain, malted barley and other specialty malts for home-brewing.  For tortilla dough, you need to adjust the plates for a fine grind to come up with a smooth dough that isn't gritty.  Tamales can be made from masa ground a little coarser allowing the use of a food processor if a plate mill isn't available.  It might be possible to use a food processor for tortilla dough, but I doubt you would end up with the smooth consistency desirable for tortillas.  After the nixtamal has been put through the mill, water should be worked into the masa as needed to make a medium-soft consistency dough. Hand-patting tortilla dough is an art in itself and the necessary skill takes a long time to learn (I tried it, but gave up out of frustration). A rolling pin can be used, but a tortilla press works better.  I have both a cast iron and an aluminum press, but I don't see why one couldn't use a couple pieces of hardwood and a hinge to fabricate a viable substitute for a store-bought press.

Tortillas de Maiz

 1 pound fresh masa for tortillas

    or

 1.75 cups masa harina reconstituted with about  1.25 to 1.5 cups of warm water

Gradually knead the masa into a smooth consistency, pushing with the heal of the hand (3 to 5 minutes should be sufficient depending on whether using fresh masa or reconstituted masa harina).  Wrap the dough in wax paper or plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Place a comal or heavy frying pan over medium-high heat.  Break off a piece of the dough about the size of a golf ball and pat it a few times to partially flatten it.  Place the ball of dough between a folded sheet of polyethylene (wax paper could probably be used in place of the plastic) on a tortilla press (a little off center towards the hinge) and press hard.  Remove the tortilla from the press and peel off the plastic. If the dough has the correct amount of water, the plastic will peel easily off the tortilla.  If the plastic sticks, the dough is too moist.  If the tortilla cracks around the edges, the dough is to dry. Place the tortilla on the hot, ungreased comal and bake until the edges start to dry (about 30 seconds).  Flip and bake until lightly speckled on the underside (about 1 minute).  Flip a second time and bake for about 30 seconds more.  As the tortillas come off the comal, they should be wrapped together in a towel to keep them soft and warm. The side that's up after the second flip is considered the inside...where the filling would go if making tacos, flautas, enchiladas, or whatever.

To be honest, fresh nixtamal and masa (as well as fresh tortillas) are so easy to find in So. Calif. I don't have to go through all that hassle (although, I do usually buy fresh nixtamal to grind into masa for making tamales).  But for those who aren't so lucky, the above process should take care of the situation.  Good luck in your efforts...

I read an article in the Boston Herald (daily newspaper) about a newly discovered marinade recipe that greatly diminishes the cancer-causing compounds on grilled food.

It's the combination of these ingredients that make it work, so you can adjust them a bit to taste--just don't leave any out.

The laboratory report was in a magazine called New Choices. The lab is Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

                       Noni Afghani (Afghan Bread)

Recipe By     : Mark Copeland
Serving Size  : 8    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Bread, Rolls And Cornbread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2  cups          water -- warm
   1      package       dry yeast -- (1/4 oz 7 grams)
   1      tablespoon    sugar
   4      cups          flour
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/4  cup           corn oil
   1                    egg yolk mixed with a little water
   1      tablespoon    water
   1      tablespoon    black cumin seed or caraway seeds

These small oval breads are baked in a tandoor, the stove of the region -- sometimes buried in the ground as it is in India. The Afghan oven is above ground and is of rounded bricks.  A wood fire is made in the bottom of the oven, a cover is placed over the oven opening and the oven is heated.  The matzoh and noni doughs are shaped and then slapped onto and stuck to the inside surface of the hot bricks for fast baking.

1. Mix 1/2 cup of warm water, yeast, and sugar together and let it proof for 10 minutes. When froth appears, sprinkle 1/2 tsp. flour on top and let it continue to proof for 5 minutes more. The froth will rise quickly.

2. Put flour in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle salt over it. Make a well in middle of the flour and add oil and the yeast mixture. Stir this in and add small amounts of water until you have produced a soft, moist dough that can be handled. Knead well for 5 minutes. Put dough ball back in bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise for 1-1/2 hours. Punch down dough.

3. Divide dough into 8 equal parts and roll each part into a ball. Roll each ball into a oval shape 6 to 7 inches long and 1/2 inch thick. Draw tines of a fork in 3 lines along length of each noni for a decorative design. Paint each noni w/egg mixture and sprinkle over all 1/2 tsp. black cumin seeds. (This is traditional seed to use, but caraway seeds may be substituted if black cumin seed is unobtainable. Put noni on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 350F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes. The brown top will glisten. Makes 8 noni.

NOTE: Black Cumin (Bunium persicum B. Fedtsch): Smaller and sweeter than standard cumin seed; plants grow wild in Middle East. The seeds are used in Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. Black cumin seeds are sprinkled on Afghan bread.

                        ***See Directions***      

While this is a process that doesn't require much work, it does take a good deal of time, so if you want to serve dinner at 6:00 P.M., you'll need to get started by 9:00 in the morning. You'll either need a six- to seven pound fresh shoulder picnic or Boston Butt (the two halves cut from the twelve- to fifteen-pound whole shoulder, which is what's barbecued by restaurants); a covered, kettle type grill; ten pounds of high quality hardwood charcoal (I prefer Kingsford); a bag of hickory wood chunks (not chips); a second grill or other container for lighting additional coals; a small shovel or scoop; and a pair of heavy-duty rubber gloves.

Begin by generously salting the exposed meat side of the picnic or Boston Butt and leave it out at room temperature for thirty minutes or so while you're getting the charcoal fire ready. Light five pounds of charcoal in the bottom of the grill and wait until the briquettes are entirely covered with gray ash. When the coals are ready, leave six or seven briquettes in a ten-inch circle at the center of the grill and push the remaining briquettes into two even piles on opposite sides of the grill. Gently place two hickory chunks on top of each pile, being careful not to collapse the mound of briquettes. When the chunks begin to smoke, put the wire cooking grate in place and set the shoulder on it, directly over the circle of coals in the center. Place the meat side down so that the fat can drip all the way down through the meat and onto the coals (this keeps the meat from drying out). Place the cover on the grill, leaving the ventilation holes completely open.

(Note: When working with a charcoal fire this small, I've found that hickory wood chips don't work very well. If you soak them in water for thirty minutes, as the manufacturer recommends, they often kill the coals when they are placed on the fire, whereas if you put them atop the briquettes without soaking, they tend to catch fire, causing excessive darkening and drying of the meat. The larger chunks, on the other hand, are slow to burst into flame and usually provide a good thirty minutes of smoke before they need replacing. You won't need to soak them, since they'll seldom burst flame up as long as the cover is on the grill.)

As soon as you have the meat on the fire, you'll need to light another pile of around twelve briquettes in your secondary grill or fire bucket so that they'll be ready to add to the grill in approximately thirty minutes. When the briquettes are completely covered with gray ash, transfer them to the grill, gently adding six briquettes to each pile. Some kettle grills, such as the Weber brand, have an opening at each side of the wire cooking grate that allows you to add additional coals or wood chunks without removing the grate. Lay two more hickory chunks atop the fresh coals on each side, replacing the grill's lid as quickly as possible.

One of my favorite outdoor-cooking implements is a folding, army-surplus shovel or entrenching tool, which is ideal for transferring the lighted coals from one grill to the other. Actually, any small shovel or scoop will serve; a pair of barbecue tongs will also do the trick nicely, although tongs take a little longer since you can move only one briquette at a time.

Continue adding six fully lit briquettes and two hickory chunks to each side of the grill every thirty minutes or so. You won't need to add any more briquettes to the center, directly under the meat-the meat will become deeply browned without any additional coals in the center. In between the addition of fresh coals, try to resist the temptation to lift the lid to inspect the meat-this causes significant heat loss and slows down the cooking process.

Around 3:30 or 4:00 in the afternoon-or after about six hours on the grill-turn the picnic or Boston Butt so that the meat side is facing up. At this point, you can reduce the number of coals to four or five on each side if it looks as though the meat is browning too quickly, but it's important to keep adding coals and wood chunks on a regular basis so that the temperature in the kettle grill doesn't get too low.

After another couple of hours of cooking with the skin side down, both the exposed meat and the skin of the shoulder should be a deep reddish brown. Put on your rubber gloves and give the meat a good squeeze with both hands; it should be done enough for you to feel the meat "give" beneath your fingers. Wearing the rubber gloves, transfer the shoulder from the grill to a pan or a cutting board. The skin covering one entire side of the shoulder should easily lift off in one piece with just a gentle tug. Set the skin aside and use a sharp knife to scrape or cut away any fat which may be clinging to the meat. The remaining lean meat should be tender enough for you to easily tear it off the bone in chunks by hand, although it's all right if you need to use knife to finish the job.

Arrange the chunks of meat into a pile on the cutting board and chop the cooked pork to the consistency you like with a heavy cleaver. (You may prefer to either slice the meat or continue pulling it into smaller pieces with your fingers.) The meat should be liberally splashed with a sauce of your choice- a tart, vinegar-tomato, Lexington-style sauce would be appropriate-and served either on a plate accompanied by coleslaw or on a warm, soft bun topped with slaw.

                        lean pork on bones. no fat!
                        white hominy
                        **SEPARATELY IN BOWLS**
                        chopped white cabbage
                        white onions -- chopped
                        little green onions -- chopped
                        red radishes -- chopped

                        plain white bread
                        oregano
                        salt in shaker

Cook pork until tender. Add hominy and continue cooking until both are ready. Skim excess oils and fat. Serve in large soup bowls. This is better than menudo on Sunday morning!

Cook the pork for quite a while and when the hominy is all cooked in the pork broth (after it is skimmed), just add the ingredients from the separate bowls until you get it the way you want it. This is the way they do it in Mexico. The bread is for slurping up the juices in the bowl. Some of the Mexicans like hard rolls. If you have this for breakfast on Sunday morning you must have a beer with it.

Sauté onion in oil.  Drain carrots, reserving liquid, add carrots to pan and sauté.  Add remaining ingredients except celery salt, along with reserved liquid, bring to a boil, reduce heat.  Simmer.  Just before serving add celery salt to taste to cut the sweetness.

NAD BUNEP NEVSID, pronounced "You can only have this much."

This is not mashed potatoes or refried beans, but plays one on TV.  Note: There is no known Q that this won't go with.  Please advise.

This is obviously very easy (Lazy?) to make.  Spelled out: In a preheated bare-naked pot over medium-high heat, add cold oil, sauté onion till limp.  Add drained carrots and continue to sauté until the carrot slivers shrink up some.  (We are carmalizing the onion and carrot, and disguising the carrots a little) Add remaining ingredients except celery salt.  Bring to a roiling boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring once in a while.  When everything is softened and most of the liquid is gone, serve this to somebody who doesn't particularly like vegetables.  Tell 'em it's a lumpy yet not particularly colorful Soul Food from a recipe handed down from generation to generation since around the end of the twentieth century.  Admit that it isn't very healthful, but sure tastes good and there ain't enough for seconds.  When I advertise this invention on my new late night infomercial, it will claim, "Several separate flavors in every bite." This will be true, since the flavors DON'T mingle, try it and see.  Serves 4

              Nuoc Cham (Vietnamese Chili Sauce For Dipping)

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Other Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2                    dried red chilies
   2      cloves        garlic
     1/2  teaspoon      sugar
   2      tablespoons   fish sauce
   1      tablespoon    vinegar
   1      tablespoon    lemon juice

The red stuff can be had in stores.  It comes in a clear plastic bottle with a green lid and a red rooster on the plastic.  Or in smaller glass jars.  It's called "Tuong ot toi Viet Nam" (tung ot toy) and is nothing more than red chilies mashed up with a bit of garlic. You could easily make it by smashing up a handful of the little red hot peppers and a couple of cloves of garlic in a mortar and pestle. There's a similar Filipino sauce called "Sambal Oeleck" virtually the same but with the addition of vinegar. Here's my favorite recipe for nuoc cham. I have some variants if you'd like to see those too. I use it on a lot of stuff--it's very good with poached or white cooked chicken, thousand year eggs, shrimp chips.

Mince chilies and garlic finely and place in a mortar.  Mash with the heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves. Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between each addition. This makes enough for 2 to 4 people.  I almost always double the recipe just to make sure there's enough.  I've kept it for long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime after a few days.

From "Great Asia Steambook" by Irene Wong.  Published by Taylor and Ng, distributed by Random House.  1977.  ISBN 0-912738-11-1.

This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip for chicken or whatever. Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly.  This is a good starting point. The proportions shown here produce what I consider a mildly warm dip. I generally use two to six times as many chilies, depending on their strength and how hot I want it.

VARIATIONS:  Use green serrano chilies instead of dried red ones, thinly slice a red or green chili into rounds and toss them in, lime juice instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of granulated. If you make it in a food processor, don't over process.  It should have small chunks of each ingredient rather than being a homogeneous liquid. The taste is sour and hot, very puckery.  It's great with poached or steamed chicken, duck or game hens.  Much better with basically bland dishes rather than something like curry which has it's own blend of spices. Good with Chinese white-cut chicken or Steamed Ginger Chicken with Black Bean sauce. It's truly addictive and I often serve it with meals that are not Oriental in origin. Should be good with a firm- fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or crab. Fish sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt. It's not really fishy tasting.  Look for it in the oriental section of supermarkets or at markets catering to Asian clientele.  Tiparos is a good brand made in the Philippines. I prefer Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce, but they'll probably be harder to find. A timesaver is to combine large quantities of the liquid ingredients and store them in the fridge. Then, when you want some Nuoc Cham, just chop up the chilies and garlic, pound them with the sugar and add them to the liquid.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        chuck roast
   8      cloves        garlic -- crushed
     1/4  cup           olive oil
   2      tablespoons   Mexican oregano
   1      tablespoon    cumin seeds -- toasted and ground

   2      tablespoons   mild chile
   2      tablespoons   hot chile
                        beef broth
                        masa harina
          small         whole dried piquin chilies
                        salt -- to taste

This writer's own.  On the Texas range, firewood meant mesquite.  Not only did the trail cook use it for his own pit cooking, but the ranch cook used it to fire his wood stove.  Until it was replaced with gas and electric, mesquite-flavored grilling dominated rural Texas cooking with its distinctive sweet savor.  The meat of this chili is seared over charcoal where mesquite chips have been set to flame (the taste of mesquite charcoal is indistinguishable from that of any other hardwood charcoal), which gives the resulting chili a haunting hint of smoke -- and without tasting a bit like barbecue, since there is no onion or tomato in it, none at all.

For the fire: mesquite wood chips and hardwood charcoal.

For the Rub: 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and chili powder.

The chuck roast should be as lean as possible and cut at least three inches thick.  Two or three hours before you plan to make the chili, rub the meat all over with a mash of crushed garlic and salt then sprinkle it with chili powder to coat it lightly.  Loosely cover it with plastic and set it aside.

Fire up enough hardwood charcoal to sear the meat in an outdoor grill, preferably one with a cover.  At the same time, soak a few handfuls of the mesquite chips in the water.  When the coals are covered with gray ash, spread them out evenly, and scatter the soaked mesquite chips over them.  Then immediately set the meat on a grill over the smoke, about an inch from the coals.  Cover the grill and adjust the dampers to maintain a slow, steady heat.  Let meat sear for about 12 minutes (this is meant to flavor, not to cook the meat) and turn over to sear the other side for the same amount of time.  Remove it from the heat, saving any juices on its surface, and transfer to the refrigerator.  Let it cool thoroughly, about one hour.

After the meat has cooled, trim away any surface fat or cartilage.  With a sharp knife, cube the meat into the smallest pieces you have patience for, saving all juices.  Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over moderate heat.  Stir in the garlic and sauté until it turns translucent.  Stir in the meat and all reserved meat juices, adding just enough beef broth to cover, or about one cup.  Pour in the lime juice and sprinkle in the rest of the seasonings, stirring and tasting as you go.  Crumble in a few piquins or other fiery chilies to bring the heat up to taste.  However, do not try to adjust the seasoning to perfection right now; it's easy to ruin a chili by correcting the flavors too soon -- the long cooking will smooth and sweeten it.

Lower the heat to as low as possible.  If the pot is left to boil, the meat will toughen.  Every half hour or so after the first hour, taste for seasoning, adjusting and thickening with the masa harina a teaspoonful at a time.  The chili should be about ready to eat in three hours, although it will benefit from a night's aging in the refrigerator.

Serve it simmering in large, heavy bowls with an ample supply of soda crackers and a side of beans, but not much else except, maybe, hot, black coffee or quart-sized glasses of iced tea or a few frosty bottles of your favorite beer.  And, after a good long while, push things aside, lean back in your chair, and start arguing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      pound         navy or pinto beans
     1/4  teaspoon      baking soda
   4      cups          tomato juice
   2      cups          dark brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   minced onion
   2      teaspoons     McCormick's Bon Appetit
   1      teaspoon      vanilla extract
   1      teaspoon      prepared horseradish
     1/2  teaspoon      ground mustard
     1/4  teaspoon      ground cloves
     1/8  teaspoon      cardamom
     1/8  teaspoon      ground black pepper
   8      slices        bacon -- 1 inch pieces

 Pick over beans to remove stones and empty skins. Place in large bowl with cold water and soak overnight. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Place in a Dutch Oven or large saucepan. Cover with fresh water and add baking soda.  Heat to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 35 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Place beans in 3 quart casserole or bean pot, smoke-proof. Here is where I differ from the original recipe. The recipe says the oven at 300F, I go to the smoker at 250F. Bring smoker to 250F or so. Place remaining ingredients in large bowl and stir to combine. Pour over beans and stir. Bake 5 hours or until beans are tender. You can cover the pot if you like, but you'll get a nice smoky flavor if you leave uncovered for most of the cooking time then cover with foil or a lid. If the beans on top become dry, add a small amount of hot water.  A lot of effort but worth it, or you can just buy a can of cheap pork and beans and season the same way, They come out just as good.

Run the above slaw ingredients in a processor and chop until about 1/4 inch in size. Combine the sauce ingredients in a shallow mixing bowl.  Use a wisk to mix. Pour into the slaw mix and fold well.  Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours before serving.  I usually go at it right away.  Excellent.

   1 1/2  cups          pecan halves -- (un chopped)**

* NOTE #1
Any syrup can be substituted but pure sugar cane syrup is best. 
** NOTE #2
I used 3 cups of pecan halves in each pie.

Place unbaked pie shell pastry in a 9" pie pan and fill with pecan halves,

Beat eggs and raw sugar. Add cane syrup, salt, vanilla, and butter. Mix well. Pour over the pecans in the unbaked 9-inch pie shell .

Bake until filling is set, about 1 hour and 15 minutes at 325F or an hour at 350F.

***NOTE #3
The pecan halves make it hard to slice the cooled pie. Use an electric knife if possible. If not, use a SHARP serrated knife.

   1      teaspoon      cracked black pepper
     3/4  teaspoon      salt

Charlie comments: Mix all ingredients together. Carefully use as a baste for the last 10 to 20 minutes of grilling. Makes over 3/4 cup.

I marinated some chicken bits (thighs and drumsticks) in this stuff for a few hours.

The bits were smoked in a Weber Kettle for about an hour with the food on one side and the fire heaped up on the other (charcoal with chunks of plum wood). Basted occasionally with the marinade which had been boiled (can't be too careful!). I managed to keep the temperature at the grill down to around 240-260F.

Then I spread the coals out, opened the vents and moved the chicken bits directly over coals and crisped them. I basted liberally.

Verdict: The kids loved it. I found it a bit sweet. Maybe next time I'll add some Texas Pete or some other hot sauce.

   4      cups          water
   3      pounds        sugar -- about

Wash fruit well, cut in half and remove seeds.  Cut into small pieces.  Add water and let stand for 24 hours.  Weigh the mixture on a scale and ready as much sugar on the side.  Cook mixture for 30 minutes.  Add sugar.  Keep cooking and stirring until mixtures drips of ladle in wide, heavy drops.  Remove foam.  (I put the foam into a separate bowl and eat it after it has cooled down.  Delicious!) Fill into glasses (preheat or put spoon into glass to avoid cracking) and close airtight immediately.

   1      pound         pig's or lamb's liver
   3                    onions
   5      ounces        minced suet
     1/2  pint          water
   3      ounces        pinhead oatmeal
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/2  teaspoon      pepper

Simmer liver and onions in stock for 30-40 minutes.  Put oatmeal in a heavy pan over heat or under the grill, and toast until nicely browned.  When the meat is cooked, remove from pan, keeping liquid.  Mince liver and onions, add oatmeal, suet, salt and pepper.  Moisten with sufficient liquid to give a softish consistency, put in a greased pudding basin and cover with a double lid of foil, and steam for 3 hours.  Now, you probably don't have a pudding basin (I'm not sure what one is).  From "The Highlander's Cookbook," by Sheila MacNiven Cameron, here is an alternate method:

Turn into a greased Pyrex bowl.  Cover with two or three layers of foil.  Steam on a rack in a pan of boiling water for two hours, adding more boiling water as it boils away.

The leaves are washed, boil 20 minutes, let drain and dry. Boil the corn until soft and grind to make the masa. Boil the chicken or pork until tender, remove the bones and sauté in butter or oil. When this starts to brown  add the onion, pepper, tomato, culantro, oregano and tomato paste. Add 3 or 4 cups of water and cook to make the sauce. Strain and save both parts separately. Stir the liquid into the masa until it is a little softer than mashed potatoes. Take a piece of banana leaf, place a spoonful of masa  in the center of the leaf, squash it down a little to make a pocket, add the meat sauce that was strained out, add another spoonful of masa and fold the leaf around it. Tie with string. Put a large pan of water to boil. Add the tamales. Boil for 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot. They may be made ahead of time, frozen and re-heated. To re-heat, microwave or steam.

Serve with green salad and a good Chianti (e.g. Antinori) or Rosso di Montalcino (Il Poggione or Col D'Orcia).

Carnivores can also add sliced Italian pizza or luganega sausage (1/4 inch thick sliced on bias) to this when the cheeses are put into the sauce, brown the luganega slices in a little oil first.  Spanish chorizo also works well.

   1      tablespoon    rosemary

   1      teaspoon      dried orange peel
   2      teaspoons     tarragon
   2      teaspoons     basil

This turned out great but wasn't quite right. The sumac berries were awesome! They have a tart but mild flavor. I found out about these while perusing a Penzey's catalog (414) 574-0277. Bought them out of curiosity and use them regularly now. The rub does need another flavor, though I think I could get rid of the basil. Next time I'll try a little coriander or thyme and some white pepper. I also plan on creating a version of this rub for chicken.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           butter -- 1 stick
   2      cups          minced onion
   4      cloves        garlic -- pressed
   2      cups          ketchup
   2      cups          chili sauce
   1      cup           brown sugar -- packed
     1/2  cup           fresh lemon juice
     1/4  cup           red wine vinegar
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1      tablespoon    liquid smoke
   1      tablespoon    prepared yellow mustard
   2      teaspoons     salt
   2      teaspoons     black pepper
   1      teaspoon      cayenne

Heat the butter in a large non-reactive saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until just soft. Pour in the ketchup and chili sauce, and blend in well. Add the rest of the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.

This sauce will keep for up to 2 weeks in an airtight jar in the refrigerator.

Begin applying the sauce warm to barbecuing brisket, about 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time.

My Notes: In place of the chili sauce I used some fresh roasted New Mexican red chilies pureed in the food processor with a little water. I didn't use the liquid smoke because I don't like the taste of it and the meat had plenty of smoke flavor on its own. While this is not a real sweet sauce, I would still use a little less sugar next time.

Roux

From: Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen ISBN 0-688-02487-0

A roux is a mixture of flour and oil. The cooking of flour and fat together to make a roux is a process that seems to go back as far as my ancestors of four hundred years ago. Traditionally, the fat used was animal fat, though today various oils are used, and the roux was, and often still is, made by very slow cooking. For example, when I was a boy, my mother used to start with a paste of animal fat and flour and cook it for several hours. Over the years I've developed a way to cook roux so it can be made in a matter of minutes, over very high heat, and with very few exceptions this is the method used in this book's recipes.

The basic reason for making a roux is for the distinctive taste and texture it, lends to food, This roux taste and texture is characteristic of many dishes that Louisiana Cajuns make.

The first few times, making a roux may seem difficult, and, certainly, using oil heated to over 500F has an element of danger to it. However, once you've made roux several times and become more accustomed to handling the high temperature, you will find it to be extremely rewarding because of the uniqueness of the finished product-and, as lagniappe, you're sure to get praise from everyone who tastes your cooking.

How to Make a Roux

A few overall points may be helpful:

The usual proportion of oil to flour is fifty-fifty. Roux can be made in advance, cooled and then stored in an air tight jar for several days, in the refrigerator or at room temperature. If roux is made ahead, pour off excess oil from the surface and reheat (preferred), or let it return to room temperature before using.

In general, light and medium-brown roux are used in sauces or, gravies for dark, heavy meats such as beef, with game such as elk and venison, and with dark-meat fowl such as duck, geese and blackbirds. They give a wonderful, toasted nutty flavor-just the right enhancement-to these sauces and gravies.  Dark red-brown and black roux are used in sauces and gravies for sweet, light, white meats such as pork, rabbit, veal, and all kinds of freshwater and saltwater fish and shellfish. In addition, black roux are best to use in gumbos because the darkest roux result in the thinnest, best-tasting gumbos of all; but it takes practice to make black roux without burning them, and dark red-brown roux are certainly acceptable for any gumbo.  You'll notice that I make exceptions to these general guidelines in some recipes.  These Conceptions simply reflect my preference for the flavor of a particular roux with the combined flavors of the other ingredients in certain dishes. (For example, I prefer the flavor of a medium-brown roux in Grillades and Grits-a veal dish-and in Sticky Chicken, rather than a darker roux.)

My approach to roux derives from the tradition of Cajun cooks, who view roux as being essentially of two types-medium brown and black; and who also classify meats as basically of two types-heavy, dark, somewhat bitter ones, and light, white, sweet ones.  Traditionally, Cajun cooks use light roux with dark meats and dark roux with light meats.  This is because they know intuitively, whether they can verbalize it or not, that these particular combinations lead to wonderful-tasting food.  Working within this tradition, I've developed variations and given you in this book the roux-meat combinations which I think are best. You'll find that as you gain more experience and skill in making roux, you'll want to experiment with the, endless combinations of roux colors and the flavors of other ingredients you're using-especially meats-to find those combinations that excite your taste buds the most!

Several words of advice are essential:

1) Cooked roux is called Cajun napalm in my restaurant's kitchen because it is extremely hot and sticks to your skin; so be very careful to avoid splashing it on you; it's best to use a long-handled metal whisk or wooden spoon.

2) Always begin with a very clean skillet or pot-preferably one that is heavy, such as cast iron (and never a non-stick type). If possible, use a skillet with flared sides because this makes stirring easier and thus makes it less likely the roux will burn.  In addition, use a large enough skillet so that the oil does not fill it by more than one-fourth of its capacity.

3) The oil should be smoking hot before the flour is added.

4) Once the oil is heated, stir in the flour gradually (about a third at a time) and stir or whisk quickly and constantly to avoid burning the mixture. (Flour has moisture in it, and adding it to hot oil often creates steam-another good reason for using long-handled whisks or spoons.)

5) If black specks appear in the roux as it cooks, it has burned; discard it (place it in a heat-proof container to cool before discarding), then start the roux over again--c'est la vie!

6) As soon as the roux reaches the desired color, remove it from the heat; stir in the vegetables, which stop the burning process and enhance the taste of the finished dish, and continue stirring until the roux stops getting darker (at least 3 to 5 minutes).

7) While cooking roux (bringing it to the desired color), if you feel it is darkening too fast, immediately remove it from the heat and continue whisking constantly until you have control of it.

8) Care and concentration are essential for you to be successful with this fast method of making roux. Especially the first few times you make a roux, be certain that any possible distractions including children-are under control.  In addition, have all cooking utensils and required vegetables or seasoning mixtures prepared ahead of time and near at hand before you start cooking.

NOTES : I scanned Prudhomme's instructions for making roux. I had a heck
of a time getting the OCR software to recognize the text. I
don't know if it doesn't like the particular font or what.
Anyway, here is his technique for making a fast roux. The
reference to adding vegetables assumes you are making a typical
Cajun dish which almost always has chopped celery, onions,
and/or bell peppers.

NOTE: If the baby food is not available, you could use the same amount of finely chopped peaches, if canned, well drained before chopping.

Combine all the ingredients thoroughly.  Core the hot dogs diagonally on three sides.  Barbecue basting with the sauce about three times while they are cooking.  You can also use this on pork or chicken or the heated sauce in a chafing dish with sliced hot dogs.  Makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce, (enough for 2 lbs. of hot dogs).

Karen Haigh says, A nice, unusual accompaniment to grilled meats and curries, or spread on toast with cream cheese.  Sweet.

Makes 1 1/5 cups

Blanch peaches for 30 seconds in boiling water, remove skins and pits and cut into slices.  Combine with all other ingredients in a microwaveable jar, leaving at least 1.5 inches free above the peaches (otherwise it will boil over).  Microwave on high for 7 minutes, stirring once.  Seal tightly with sterilized lid and refrigerate.  Will keep up to 3 months.

   2      tablespoons   butter
   1      each          small onion -- grated
   2      tablespoons   dark brown sugar
   1      teaspoon      ground cloves
   1      teaspoon      ground cayenne pepper
   1      each          16 oz can sliced peaches in heavy syrup
     1/2  cup           Bailey's Irish Cream
     1/2  cup           chopped bread and butter pickles

Many a good barbeque sauce is based on fruit nowadays.  Since in fact, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit, I suppose one could argue that fruit is the most common constituent of any barbeque sauce.  Still, one based on peaches might seem to be asking a lot of taste buds primed to mediate the hot, spicy flavors of a grill.  In actuality, it provides a soothing contrast to them.

Melt the butter in a small stainless steel or flameproof ceramic saucepan set over low heat.  Add the onion, and sauté until golden.  Stir in the brown sugar, cloves, and cayenne pepper, mixing well.  Drain the peaches, reserving the syrup.  Cut the slices in half and add them to the saucepan.  Lightly blend in first the Bailey's Irish Cream then the pickles.  Simmer, stirring gently occasionally for 20 minutes, or until the sauce thickens nicely.  Chill before serving.  This entire sauce may be blenderized to give it a smooth consistency..

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      pound         pork tenderloin
     1/2  cup           soy sauce
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
   1      tablespoon    ginger, fresh, grated OR
   1      teaspoon      dry ginger
   1      tablespoon    sesame oil
     1/4  cup           honey
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar

Combine all ingredients in a shaker and shake like the dickens.  I like to use whole fresh ginger sliced into pieces 1/8-1/4 inch thick.  That way I can remove them before grilling.  I am not a big ginger fan, thus my slicing idea.  I really think ginger can over power milder woods too.  However, if you like ginger then go for the grated ginger.

Marinate for at least 2 hrs.  or longer.  I like overnight.

Start your fire and put on your smokin' wood, I like pecan for this but use what you prefer.  Any flavor should be fine.

Sear over direct heat for about 5-8 min.  On a gas grill reduce the heat to medium and move to *indirect* heat for about 35-40 min.  (That simply means to leave one side's burner ON and put the meat on the other, OFF, side.)

For charcoal grills, still do indirectly, but just go with the flow.  If you're using a kettle type cooker and have the coals piled up high, watch your meat thermometer.  Actually, watch your thermometer whatever you do.

Exact times are not really needed if you use a thermometer.  The digital probe thermometer is made for this kind of recipe.  Set the temp watch for 155F and go about your business.

Tenderloins go from perfect to dry rather quickly.  They are easy if you just watch the internal temperature closely.  Cook them to an internal temperature of 155F then transfer the loins to foil for 10 min.  The tenderloins will complete their cooking to 160deg.  in the foil.  The internal temp.  of 160F is perfect to produce moist tender tenderloins.  Great tasting.  Be careful not to spill the juices that will pool in the foil.  Pour this juice over the loins in your serving plate.

Preparation Time: 10 minutes Cooking Time: 30 minutes or so

   2      pounds        lean boneless pork *
   2      quarts        boiling salted water -- (use 2 tsp. salt)
   1 1/2  cups          corn meal
   2      cups          cold water

Meat-filled and meat-flavored crispy fried mush from Pennsylvania Dutch Cookery.

* (we use a pieces of fresh shoulder or something even if it has a bone and I think we prefer it to have a bone)

Simmer pork in boiling salted water until meat is very tender, 2 hr.  With fork shred the cooked pork into fine pieces.  Bring to boil 1 qt. of the stock.  Mix corn meal and cold water.  ( I think mom used all stock) Stir into boiling stock.  Cook, stirring until thick.  Add seasonings.  Stir the meat into corn meal mush and cook 5 min.  pour into buttered loaf pan 9x5x3".  Chill until firm.  Slice 1/2" thick. (I like thin and rather than thick)

Brown on each side (for crispness, first dip slices in flour) this is the way we like it best.  Serve hot, plain or with syrup (our favorite) or with butter and syrup.  8 servings

   1      dozen         small eggs*

   2      cups          vinegar, white
   1                    habanero pepper
   2      tablespoons   salt

   2      teaspoons     sugar
   1      medium        onion, minced OR
   6      tablespoons   onion, powdered
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced

* The smaller the better.  quail eggs are nice but a lot of work.

I love pickled eggs and am planning to include them in a Christmas gift package my wife, kids and I are putting together.  My question is "How long will they last unrefrigerated?".  My recipe calls for refrigeration, but with all the vinegar and salt, I would think they would be "cured".  See recipe below.

Eggs: Cover with water and heat to just boiling over medium-high heat.  Remove from heat, cover and let stand for 10 min.  Drain water from eggs.  Now take the hot eggs one by one (wear a kitchen mitten, the darned things are hot!), crack them with a spoon or just whack them on the counter and drop them into a pot of cold water.  This makes them much easier to peel whole.  I'll resist the urge to bore everyone with the thermodynamics involved.  Place eggs in refrigerator overnight to chill.

Pickling Mixture: This is the basic mixture, as with BBQ sauce, feel free to improvise: ground mustard, hot sauce, chipotle peppers, curry, red pepper flakes, white pepper, whatever sounds good.

Bring the entire mixture to a boil for approx.  10 min.  Pour over peeled, chilled eggs, a large mason jar holds about 1 doz. small eggs.  Seal lid and place in fridge.  They're good the next day, even better the next and the next.

I'm not sure if the refrigerator is necessary or if it's just because they're better cold.

   1      package       fried cubed tofu
                        green papaya -- shredded (optional)

Clean hairs from pork snouts by scrapping them with a knife. Remove excess fat. When snouts are clean put the them in a pot and cover with enough water to boil. When you think that the snouts are tender and soft let them cool off and then cut the snouts into inch size pieces. Mix the rest of the ingredients in with the cut snouts. Taste a little bit so you can see if you need to add more of one or two of the ingredients to suit your taste.

                        ***See Directions***      

Take an all cotton baby sock (yes, sock) and fill it with pickling spice until you have the bottom of the sock about the size of a golf ball. Push all the spices tight into the bottom of the sock, tie off the top with a knot, cut off the excess and plop the spice sock into the sauce mix. Let it simmer in the mixture throughout the cooking process.

The dill gives the sauce that little special flavor that is familiar to all but unidentifiable. The bay keeps the dill from getting out of hand and the very very slight clove hint subconsciously reminds you of baked, glazed hams and cloves without being overbearing.  I got this hint from a friend of a friend of a friend who's aunt and uncle used  run a pit in St. Louis during the depression. After talking with this grand old lady, she reluctantly  but graciously gave me the secret and I've been using it since then.

These are the best ribs in the world. I know. I've tried them all. There is a BBQ joint in heaven and it has one thing on the menu. This is it.

1 rack of pork baby back ribs per moderately hungry person.  Marinate in cider vinegar about 10 minutes.  Liberally use garlic salt and canned black pepper
Use hickory, oak, or mesquite At 200-225F, they should take 2 1/2 hours

Use a water pan. Sauce goes on the side. (You won't need it.)

That's it? Yep. Don't mess with perfection. Don't try fresh cracked pepper or cloves of garlic. Don't try spare ribs. I did once and made my wife cry.

   2 1/2  tablespoons   garlic, minced
   1 1/2  cups          tomato juice
     1/2  cup           Yoshida's Teriyaki sauce
     1/4  cup           lemon juice
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar
   4                    bouillon cubes -- (beef)
   1      cup           water
     1/4  cup           Reno Red chile powder
   1      tablespoon    New Mexico light chile powder
   2      cups          apple juice
   2      teaspoons     Chinese hot mustard -- (dry)
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      tablespoon    pepper
   1      tablespoon    cayenne
   3      teaspoons     balsamic vinegar
   1      teaspoon      allspice
   5      pounds        country style pork ribs -- (sliced Boston butt)

Add the peanut oil to a sauce pan.  Then add the celery, onion and garlic.  Simmer for fifteen minutes.  Then add remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil and then let simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

Put the pork in the smoker and turned up the heat to 230F.  Moped every half hour for I think 3 hours, had a few beers by then. 
So now for my finishing sauce I had maybe half of mop left and added, 1/2 cup honey and a 1/2 cup maple syrup. 
Turned up heat to 260F and finished moped it a couple times for half hour.  My God what a treat, the only thing I screwed up on is not making some sort of coleslaw, I see now why I hear coleslaw mentioned on the porch so much, wish I would of had some.  You could just smell and taste the layers of flavor.

  14      ounces        crushed tomatoes
   1      small         onion -- (minced)

     1/4  cup           molasses
     1/8  cup           cider vinegar -- (amber)

   1      tablespoon    chili powder
     1/2  tablespoon    powdered mustard
   1      teaspoon      salt

This is a sauce that I use on pulled pork, my wife really likes it and thinks that it might be good on ribs.  Another suggestions would be to get a prepared sauce and add what you think is missing (I like to add jalapenos) or, we just had some Taco bell salsa, I'd bet with a bit of molasses or honey, some salt and some jalapenos that that would make for a tasty sauce.  Personally though, I wouldn't waste good BBQ on the Vikings.

Bring to boil, than simmer 1 hour.  Refrigerate until used.  I heat it up before I mix it into the pork.

Yesterday I smoked some ribs.  I got an 8 lb. pack of spareribs, and a 6 lb. pack of baby backs (cryovac packages from Price Club).  Here's roughly how I prepared them:

After rinsing and drying them, I removed the membrane from the underside of each rack.  I know some people debate the necessity of this, but I always do it.  BTW, use a paper towel to get a good grip.  I rubbed them liberally with the Galena Street rub from Penzey's.  This is a pretty decent rub mixture.  I'm not sure if I'll buy more, since I have a recipe that I like, but hey, I got a two cup shaker bottle out of the deal.

I smoked them for 4 hours (about 220F) using whole pecan logs.  I then wrapped each rack individually in heavy-duty foil and tossed them back in the smoker for another hour.  I suppose you could just keep them in the oven, since they don't get any smokier, but the oven was being used for something else.  During smoking, I sprayed them regularly with water from a spray bottle that I use just for this.  You could use a mop, but I find that, for my tastes, really liberal application of rub and the light spritzing of water give them plenty of flavor.  BTW, don't wash off the rub, you just want to keep the surface meat from getting too dry.  I also placed a pan of water right where the heat from the firebox enters the smoking chamber. It held 4 cups of water and about 1 was left, so it's not a lot of steam generated.

 I separated them before serving and put sauce on half and left
the other half dry.

   1      tablespoon    Lawry's Garlic Salt - Coarse Ground -- with Parsley
   1      tablespoon    cracked black pepper
   1      tablespoon    paprika
   2      teaspoons     celery salt
                        ***MOP***
  12      ounces        apple juice
   2      teaspoons     lemon juice

I am becoming convinced that *simple* is better. I am on a quest to develop BBQ techniques that use a handful of ingredients to deliver the BBQ taste we all crave. To that end, here is the rub and baste I used today: (BTW, the BBQ drew raves by my most severe critics...my family.) 
BBQ Pork Roast

Prep: Wash roast and pat dry. Rub a thin layer of prepared table mustard over the entire surface. Mix rub ingredients together well, then sprinkle on the rub (makes enough for a four pound roast) and "rub" it in to the meat if you want. I just "press" it into the meat here-and-there with my fingers. Let the roast stand for at room temp for about an hour (if you want to dry marinate it longer, be sure to refrigerate the meat, then bring it to room temp before cooking.)

I cooked this on a Weber kettle using both charcoal briquettes and hickory chunks. I filled my chimney starter about 2/3 full of  Kingsford briquettes and topped it off with a couple of baseball size chunks of hickory. When the hickory started to really blaze, I dumped the fuel into the Weber and moved it all to one side. I put a pan with water opposite the coals, replaced the cooking grid, and put the roast over the pan of water. The bottom vents were 3/4 closed and the top vent fully open. After 30 minutes I rotated the roast 180F and spray-basted it with the mop.

I continued to rotate and baste the roast every 30 minutes for three hours, adding a couple of water-soaked hickory chunks to keep the smoke flowing. At the three hour mark I added another 2/3 chimney starter full of blazing briquettes and hickory chunks. 
Right about that time, my wife called (from her mother's house) and said, "Supper better be ready when I get home." Since she would be home in an hour, I figured I better check the temp of the roast. I *almost* panicked when the thermometer read 140F, but I got a grip and let my imagination and common sense kick in. I removed the roast and cooking grid, put the water pan in the middle of the cooking grate, and made two piles of coals on either side of the pan. Then I put the roast over the water pan and cranked the bottom vents all the way open. Every ten minutes from then on, I turned the roast and sprayed it liberally with the baste.

When the boss got home, the roast was done. It was juicy and tender, it tasted like BBQ, and I didn't get clobbered with a rolling pin....Life is good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    young -- fat possum
   8                    sweet potatoes -- peeled
   2      tablespoons   butter
   1      tablespoon    sugar
                        salt
                        bacon
                        thyme or marjoram
                        pepper

First catch a young fat possum. This in itself affords excellent sport on moonlight nights in fall. Remove the fur either by skinning or by soaking the possum in hot lye water, being careful not to get any on the hands.  Clean, take off the head and feet (unless you want to cook it like whole roast pig), and wash well. Salt the possum well inside and out and freeze overnight either outdoors or in the refrigerator compartment. When ready to cook, peel 8 sweet potatoes and boil them tender in slightly salted water to which 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of sugar have been added.  At the same time, stew the possum tender in a tightly covered pan with a little water. Arrange the potatoes around the possum, strip with bacon, sprinkle with thyme or marjoram, or with pepper, and brown in the oven. Baste often with the drippings. Served hot, it sure is "a dish fo' a king."

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Possum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      Small         possum or bandicoot*
   2      liters        Water
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      tin           corn*
                        any other vegies desired
   1      pinch         celery leaves
   1      pinch         parsley
                        flour or gravox* to thicken
                        fried bread -- 1 slice per serving

Skin and clean possum or bandicoot, then quarter the animal. (Video tape this please. I have no idea how to do it. Also "first you have to catch a possum or bandicoot", but then that's another story.) Place it in a large pot or camp oven along with water and salt. Cover and simmer gently for 3 or 4 hours. (Tough little devils apparently.) Add vegetables and simmer for another 1 1/2 hours (Still tough. Even the vegies are resisting being associated with this.) Strain soup through a large holed colander when meat has left bone and remove bones, especially small ones. Return soup to the pot and add parsley and celery leaves. Thicken with a little flour or gravox. Cut fried bread into 1 inch squares and serve soup over toast, boiling hot.

*For those of you that haven't met a bandicoot, it is something between a possum and a raccoon, sort of, I think, maybe.

*Tin of corn? Well a can I guess, 16 oz.

*Now, when you boil this meat for 5 1/2 hours, strain it and throw it away, it does make me wonder why you started in the first place.

*Gravox is a meat concentrate seasoning I think. The dish must be need some flavor.

*Fry the bread any way you want to.

*All things considered, a brick or stone would be a reasonable alternative if you don't happen to have a possum or bandicoot available.

Brown onion in hot fat, add finely chopped liver. Cook until tender. Add other ingredients plus enough water to moisten mixture. Mix, stuff possum and skewer or sew the opening shut. Suggestions: Some parboil the possum before roasting. Others remove the skin and fat. Try rubbing possum with a little sage before roasting. Sweet potatoes are absolute requirement to a Southerner.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        FOR THE POT LIKKER:
   1      large         bunch of collards
   8      quarts        water
   2      whole         Tabasco peppers
   1 1/2  pounds        smoked pork jowls
   8      whole         cloves of garlic -- peeled
   2      cups          distilled vinegar
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
     1/2                onion
                        FOR THE CHILI:
   6      quarts        pot likker
   2                    bay leaves
   1      3 pound       smoked chuck roast
   2 1/2  pounds        hamburger
   2      pounds        pinto beans
  84      ounces        canned tomatoes -- roughly chopped
   6      ounces        tomato paste
   5                    chipotle peppers -- roughly shredded
   4      red           jalapeno peppers -- chopped
   1                    habanero pepper -- chopped
   3      large         onions -- chopped
   2      heads         garlic -- pressed
   2      tablespoons   whole cumin seeds -- roasted
   2      tablespoons   whole black mustard seeds -- roasted
   4      tablespoons   cumin powder
   4      tablespoons   paprika
   2      tablespoons   oregano -- crushed
   2      tablespoons   dried shrimp
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
     1/2  cup           Worcestershire sauce
     1/2  cup           nuoc nam
  12      ounces        cheap American beer

This is hardly a traditional (Texas) recipe for chili, but it turned out pretty good.

First, make the pot likker. Wash and soak the collard greens, remove the leaves from the stems, and put into a large pot. Add water, vinegar, Tabasco peppers, garlic cloves, onion, smoked pork jowl, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for six to eight hours. Remove and reserve collards for another meal; strain pot likker and reserve.

Now, add pinto beans and bay leaves to the pot likker, bring to a boil, and simmer until beans are semi-soft. Cut smoked chuck roast into bite-sized chunks and add to the pot. Fry up hamburger, drain fat, chop, and add to the pot. In a small frying pan roast the cumin and mustard seeds, crush in a mortar and pestle, and add to the chili. Add all other ingredients, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and serve.

NOTES : Received this from a housewife (Ellen Cleary) in New Orleans on the cooking echo. She would rub this under the skin of the turkey while it was defrosting for the two to three days before Thanksgiving. Tried it and fell in love with it. Then tried it on chickens, then as a marinade before barbequing. Works also for injecting poultry (have to use fine garlic or it will clog up your needle) before deep frying it. Try it

This is from the site Rock had posted "Rastafire". Tried it yesterday running the smoker at 325F with lightly pounded skinless and boneless chicken breasts, cooking time 35 minutes. Very very juicy breasts may be a kin to brining, only quicker. Excellent flavor Prep work is very important ... especially for chicken! One reason chicken tastes better in the islands is due to the way the chicken is cleaned.

Put chicken halves, quarters, or pieces in the sink or a large bowl. Cover the chicken with cool water and squeeze one lemon, lime, or even an orange over the chicken. Stir and then let sit for at least 30 minutes.

Next, drain off the liquid and start "desliming" the chicken. ("Desliming" is the process of removing excess fat from the bird.) Use salt as an abrasive to rub off slime and fat. You want to remove as much fat as possible. Thighs have a lot of excess fat plus a "vein" on the skinless side. Grab this yellow "fat vein" between a knife and your finger. Strip out. Breasts also have these yellow "fat veins". Remove all of the fat that you can. Legs are fine, just rub with salt. After rubbing off or removing as much slime and fat as possible, wash chicken in cold water and drain. The salt will wash away so it does not add a measurable amount of sodium to the chicken.

Do this once and you will always do it! Chicken looks whiter on the skin side and has a fresher look and taste. Naturally, removing the slime and excess fat lowers the calories and fat content of the dish the chicken will be used in.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        beef short ribs -- (up to 6)
   1      cup           mansion barbecue spice mix
                        bowl of beer mop sauce for meat
                        ***GLAZE AND BARBECUE SAUCE***
   1 1/2  cups          ketchup
   1      cup           beer
     3/4  cup           cider vinegar
   3      tablespoons   cilantro minced
   3      tablespoons   dark brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
   2      teaspoons     cumin seeds -- toasted and ground
   1 1/2  teaspoons     anise seeds -- toasted and ground
   1 1/2  teaspoons     salt
   1      teaspoon      Tabasco

Massage each short rib with the dry rub.  Place the ribs in plastic trash bag, and put them in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day mix the mop sauce and prepare the pit for smoking.  Place the ribs in the pit, fatty side up, and cook them between 200F and 220F for 5 hours.  Until the last hour, baste with the mop sauce every 30 to 60 minutes.  While the ribs are smoking, prepare the glaze so it is ready to apply approximately 45 minutes before the meat is done.  Mix the glaze ingredients in a saucepan, and bring them to a simmer, stirring frequently.  Cook the mixture for 30 minutes.  Mop the glaze on the top and sides of the ribs twice during the last 30 to 60 minutes of cooking time.  (Never apply glaze before the last hour or it will burn.) Return the remaining glaze to the stove, and simmer it until it's reduced by one-third, about 15 to 20 minutes.  After removing the ribs from the pit, allow them to sit 10 minutes, and then trim the fat.  Serve them with the reduced glaze on the side.  Yield: 6 servings

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           onion -- chopped
   2      each          garlic cloves -- minced
   1      tablespoon    olive oil
     1/2  cup           carrots -- chopped
     1/8  cup           water
  12      each          habaneros -- stemmed, chopped
     1/2  cup           white vinegar
     1/4  cup           lime juice

Sauté onions and garlic in oil over medium low heat until soft but not brown.  Add carrots and water.  Bring to boil, reduce to low and cook until carrots are cooked.  Remove this mixture to a blender and blend along with the Habaneros.  When smooth, mix in vinegar and lime juice and simmer briefly.  If you are looking to use the sauce immediately, simmer for 5 minutes; if you are going to store it, 2 minutes will be sufficient heat.  You may up to double the Habs before creating a painfully hot sauce (about at hot as Melinda's reserve).  In any case, this stuff should be packed into sterilized containers for storage unless you want to drink it up all at once...  <grin> Adapted from DeWitt and Gerlach, The Whole Chile Pepper Book.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        See Directions

I too have the smokin' pit pro. The first thing you want to do , if you haven't already , is to season it, or "burn it in". Spray the entire cooking chamber, and grates with "Pam", or wipe it all down with a vegetable oil. Light a fire with wood, briquettes, or lump charcoal in the firebox. Open the vents to the firebox wide open and let it go for about an hour, with the smokestack wide open. Your smoker is now seasoned and you've burnt away any impurities that may be present from the manufacturing process. Once you've done this you won't have to do it again.

I burn oak logs in my smoker. I split them into smaller pieces than I would if burning them in a fireplace. I dislike the flavor I get from briquettes. I like lump charcoal a lot. It burns hotter and imparts a good taste to whatever I'm cooking. It costs more than the oak I use, and that is why I usually reserve it for grilling steaks and lamb chops and such. If you can get it locally, and don't have access to some good hardwood logs, by all means, use the lump charcoal. I prefer the lump mesquite, but any would be good.

Get yourself some nice ribs. Baby back ribs are even better, as far as I'm concerned, but that is just a personal opinion. I find the spare ribs are just too fatty, and if not cut properly by the butcher, can contain a lot of cartilage. I like to pull the membrane off the backside. Stick a dull knife under the membrane, at about the second bone in and work it along to the first bone and out. Grab the membrane with a paper towel and pull it down the length of the ribs until it is off. Don't worry if some of it tears and stays on. As long as most of it is removed, they will be fine. In fact, some people don't bother to remove the membrane at all.  Sometime on Friday put together a rub and rub it into the ribs well. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate over night.  If using spareribs, they will take about six hours to cook on the smoker. 
Baby backs will take about 4 hours.

About an hour before you're ready to put the ribs on the smoker, take them out of the refrigerator, leave them wrapped, and allow them to come to room temperature on the counter.

Now, you want to get the fire started. Open the vent all the way. Put your lump charcoal in and light it. I prefer to use lots of news paper under the charcoal, instead of using starter fluid. However, if it's cold out and the humidity is high, I keep a can of fluid handy as a last resort. Leave the lid on the firebox open for about half an hour to let the charcoal get nice and hot. Now comes the tricky part. Make sure the smokestack is open at least 3/4 of the way, if not all the way. I usually leave mine all the way open. Close the lid on the firebox and close the side vent about 3/4 closed. Watch the temp gauge on the cooking chamber. Try to regulate the vent on the firebox to get a cooking temp as read on your gauge of about 265-275F. That should bring the temperature at grate level to about 220F. The Brinkmanns have a variance of about 40-50F between the top of the smoker to the grate level where the meat is actually cooking. In fact, while cooking the ribs, touch the top of the cooker with your hand. Notice how you can only put your hand there for a second or two? Now place your hand  underneath the cooker. You can probably keep your hand there for a long time. Just thought I'd throw this info in so you can see the variable on the cooker.

Once you think you have a good temperature hold on the cooker, lay your ribs right on the rack in the cooking chamber. When doing ribs, you will have one end very near to the firebox. I always take a small piece of foil and put one part under the ribs near the firebox and bend it upwards to shield the ends from burning. Rotate the ribs a couple of times while cooking, as the far end of the smoker will be hotter than the other. This just helps for even cooking.

If you have a mop to use on the ribs put it on about every forty five
minutes to an hour. Be prepared and do it quick so as not to lose all your heat. If you don't have a mop, that's o.k. too. If you don't have one but want to use one, just make some extra rub and mix it in with a can of beer and some cider vinegar and use that. Or experiment.  Feed the fire as necessary to maintain the temp. If you are stuck using briquettes, I would suggest you start them in a chimney and add them as needed. 
Lump charcoal can be added right to the fire. The smoke flavor will be absent if using briquettes. It will be a little more noticeable with lump charcoal. If you want even more smoke, add a split hardwood log every hour or so, or you can purchase some hardwood chips at just about any store.

If you maintain the temperature pretty well, don't worry, you will see the temperature go up and down by 30-50F, the ribs should be done around the times I specified. To test them, just try to tear one with your hands, between two of the center bones. They should just pull apart and the meat will pull away from the bone leaving it clean. The internal temp of pork when well done will be about 170F. Don't worry if it goes a little over as might happen when cooking this way. Also, don't be alarmed if the meat still looks pink, as the smoke will impart a pink color to the meat do to a chemical reaction, that I can't recall the name.

                            Qman's Hushpuppies

Recipe By     : Mrs. Robert Bowlus
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Hushpuppies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           cornmeal
   1      teaspoon      baking powder
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      sugar
   1      cup           flour
   1                    egg
     3/4  cup           milk
   1      dash          red pepper
                        green onion tops -- chopped
   1      tablespoon    onion -- grated

This is a recipe that we have made for decades, and is from the "River Road Recipes", published by the Junior League of Baton Rouge, La. 1963. The key to this recipe, and these hush puppies is the GREEN ONION TOPS...the way they have, and always will be made in South Louisiana.

Sift dry ingredients into bowl. Beat egg, add milk, and add this to cornmeal mixture. Add onion and red pepper. Drop by spoonful in hot deep fat (375F) and fry until brown. This makes approximately two dozen. While there is a great deal of speculation as to the origin of hushpuppies, there should be no speculation on the tastiness of these.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           dark soy sauce
     1/2  cup           light soy sauce
     1/2  cup           dry sherry
     1/2  cup           rice wine vinegar
     1/2  cup           lime juice -- fresh squeezed OR
     1/2  cup           bottled key lime juice
   1      cup           peanut oil OR canola oil
     1/4  cup           sesame oil
   2      medium        onions
   6      cloves        garlic, to 10-cloves
   2      inches        fresh ginger, to 4 inches -- peel

Combine onions that have been quartered, garlic and the ginger that has been cut in several chunks in the food processor. Puree and add the oil while the processor is on. Combine these and all the other ingredients. Let rest for an hour or so before using to allow the flavors to marry.

Tips: Because of all the ingredients with a sugar content -- sherry and soy -- this marinade imparts a deep brown color. If possible, keep your meat wrapped for part of the cooking process. Of course, if you use this for pork tenderloins or chops, the cooking time is short enough for the marinade not to burn.

This marinade is great on duck, too. Just prick the skin of the duck all over, let sit in the marinade 1-2 hours and roast at 400F for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the duck skin is crisp and loose from the meat. This means the thick layer of fat under the skin has self-basted itself away.

Serve with a spicy dipping sauce.

Combine peppercorns, mustard seeds, sesame seeds, salt and the ancho chile in a food processor and pulverize.  Mix this combination with the other ingredients carefully.  Don't breathe it - that will cause sneezing.  Spread on baking sheets and toast lightly in the oven at 325F for about 10 minutes.  This brings out the oils and develops the flavor more fully.  Keep in the freezer in an air-tight container.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      tablespoon    brown sugar
   1      tablespoon    ground black pepper
   1 1/2  teaspoons     white pepper
   1 1/2  teaspoons     celery salt
     1/2  teaspoon      cayenne -- (1/2 to 1)
     1/2  teaspoon      dried thyme
     1/4  teaspoon      dry mustard
   2                    rabbits (2.5 lbs. each) -- quartered
   1      tablespoon    canola/corn oil
   1      tablespoon    Creole mustard

Combine the dry rub. Massage the meat with oil and mustard, and sprinkle with rub. Place the meat in covered, shallow glass dish (or other smokeproof dish) and refrigerate for 2-3 hours.

Prepare the smoker getting the temperature to 220F or so. Remove rabbit from refrigerator and let sit for 30 minutes in the covered dish.

Cut a yard-long section of cheesecloth and dampen with water. Uncover the dish and drape the cheesecloth (folded to several thicknesses) over the dish.

Transfer the cheesecloth-covered dish to the smoker, and smoke for 1 1/4 hours. During that time, every time you add wood chips/chunks, wet down the cheesecloth again. The cheesecloth will brown but won't burn if kept moist.

Then remove and discard cheesecloth. Continue cooking until the meat is cooked through but still juicy... another 15-20 minutes. Serve right away to 5-6 folks.

NOTE: No cheesecloth is needed in a water smoker or Cookshack oven.

   2      whole         beef tri-tips -- about 2 lbs. each
                        salt and pepper to taste
                        ***CUMINUNLIME MARINADE***
   1 1/4  cups          beef broth
     2/3  cup           lime juice
     1/2  cup           olive oil
     1/4  cup           ground cumin
   3      tablespoons   ground coriander
   5      cloves        garlic -- minced
                        ***JALAPENO MARINADE***
   1 1/2  cups          white wine
   8      ounces        diced jalapeno chilies
   3      tablespoons   dried oregano leaves
     1/3  cup           olive oil

In Santa Maria along the Central Coast of California, a tradition was started of barbecuing a marinated beef tri-tip and serving it with pinto beans, sourdough bread and salsa.  The two marinades featured here offer two distinctively different flavors.  Either is easy to prepare and is an excellent complement to the robust flavor of the beef tri-tip.

Remove all fat and connective tissue from the tri-tips.  Prepare marinade of choice.  Place tri-tips in non-reactive baking dish, such as glass or enamel; pour in marinade and cover.  Refrigerate at least 6 hours, but no longer than 24 hours.  Remove tri-tips from marinade and barbecue over medium-hot coals, turning occasionally, about 35 minutes for rare.  Brush with oil frequently while barbecuing.  To serve, cut across the grain into thin slices and season to taste.  Makes 12 servings.

CuminUnLime Marinade: Mix all ingredients together in a non-reactive bowl.  Makes about 2 1/4 cups.

Jalapeno Marinade: Place 1/2 cup wine, chilies, oregano and 2 tbsp. oil in blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process until finely minced.  Stir in remaining oil and wine. 
Makes about 2 1/4 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      medium        onions skinned -- halved and sliced
   2      cloves        garlic, minced
   2                    bell peppers, halved, seeded -- sliced
     3/4  pound         zucchini, topped and tailed -- sliced on bias
   2      medium        eggplants, topped, halved lengthways -- sliced
                        Olive oil
   1                    quantity tomato/chipotle sauce.
                        Fresh herbs (basil, thyme, rosemary)

There are two essential things for good ratatouille: firstly, use the freshest, best quality produce you can get.  Using tired vegetables past their peak or (even worse) tinned or frozen will give you vegetable stew; secondly, *cook each of the constituent parts separately* only combining them for a brief simmer immediately before serving.  It takes slightly longer this way but the effort is well worth it.

The thickness of the slicing and the cooking time will vary according to your taste.  It can range from thin slicing and cooking slowly till soft to thick slicing and brief stir-frying on a fierce heat.  Experiment but go for the middle range (c 1/4 inch slices and cooking until al dente) first and see how you like that.

Take eggplant slices and layer in a colander cut sides up, sprinkle with salt.  Add extra layers as necessary.  Don't worry too much about the salt you use as you will wash most of it off later.  Leave for c 30 minutes, rinse off salt and juices that have come out of the eggplant.  Shake off excess water and leave to dry for c.  30 minutes.  This process softens the eggplant and reduces any potential bitterness.  I'm told that fresh picked eggplants do not need this but I don't grow them so I've never been able to test this out.

Heat 4-6 tablespoons olive oil in frying pan.  Fry onions and garlic gently until golden and soft, remove from pan with slotted spoon and place in large bowl.  Check oil level and add more if necessary and bring back to heat.  Fry peppers rather more vigorously stirring often until al dente, remove peppers with slotted spoon to same bowl as onions, pour back any oil from bowl into frying pan, add oil as necessary to pan and return to heat, fry courgette slices until browned both sides, remove to bowl as before.  Check oil (eggplants absorb a lot of oil while frying and adding oil while they are frying can make them soggy) and fry eggplants until browned and soft.  Remove to bowl when done.

Bring tomato sauce back to boil and add fried vegetables to it and stir in.  Add chopped fresh herbs (basil most of all, a little thyme and rosemary) simmer for 5 minutes or so until heated through.  Check for seasoning and add a little salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste, a little lemon juice will lift the flavor.

Serve either as a main course with plain boiled rice, or a starter with crusty French bread.  Also excellent as an accompaniment to char-grilled meats such as lamb or pork (or even tuna steaks).  For the last two you can cook in advance and serve it lukewarm rather than hot so it's great for barbecues.  Wine: a Bandol (or other Mourvedre/Mataro) wine or a good fruity dry rose.

Bring to a boil just before serving, on account of the smell.  It will be thin, so use a spoon to parcel it out to the worthy.  I dribbled this over Shake and Bake Pork Chops, 3/4 inch thick, and the audience said that it would be even better over nekkid Pork Q.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    Guajillo chilies, stemmed and seeded
   8      cloves        garlic -- unpeeled
     1/2  inch          piece of stick cinnamon
   2                    cloves
   8                    black peppercorns
   2      teaspoons     salt
     1/2  teaspoon      dried oregano
     1/2  teaspoon      dried thyme
     1/8  teaspoon      cumin seeds
     1/2  cup           cider vinegar
                        juice of one lime

Place a heavy duty skillet over a medium flame and add the garlic cloves.

Cook approximately 10 minutes, turning frequently. Remove garlic when soft and peel the cloves. Add the chilies to the skillet and toast briefly, about 15 seconds, on each side. Place the chilies in a bowl and cover them with boiling water, making sure all of the chilies are submerged. Let the chilies soak 30 minutes. Drain the chilies, discarding the soaking water. Pulverize the spices in a mortar or spice grinder. Place all ingredients (Chilies, garlic, spices, vinegar, and lime juice) in blender and pulse until smooth.

Strain the paste through a medium sieve. This paste will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator.

Variation: Use 8 ancho chilies instead of guajillos for a sweeter marinade.

This marinade can be used on any cut of meat, including fish and shellfish. Let meat soak in marinade from 6 to 8 hours. Then grill or bake the meat at a low oven temperature.

   2      teaspoons     cumin seeds

   1      teaspoon      salt

   1      tablespoon    chopped garlic
   1      tablespoon    chopped ginger or galangal
   1      tablespoon    shrimp paste

Place the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan, without adding any oil. Dry-fry them, stirring, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until they are slightly browned and give off a roasted aroma.

Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes.  Drain.

Pound all the ingredients together with a small amount of water to produce a paste.

You can pound the spice mix in a mortar and pestle or you can use a food processor. Make a lot of the paste and save it for use in other curries.  Store it in the refrigerator.

This curry paste goes well with all meats.

   3                    habanero peppers -- finely minced

Use a 10 inch or larger frying pan (I have a cast iron pan for this) Put the flour into the pan over moderate heat. Stir constantly until the flour gets to be a nice dark brown. This can be a little tricky but the idea is to toast the flour not burn it!

Add the oil and heat, again mixing constantly. Add the peppers. Cook and stir until the mixture forms a paste and the color you wish is achieved. Roux's can vary from a light brown to almost black. I like a reddish color. At this point you may add vegetables etc. if you wish to continue with another recipe or remove the roux from the heat and let cool for latter use. I will sometimes spread the almost cool mixture on wax paper and then freeze portions for use later

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   8      strips        bacon -- chopped
   6      cups          rice -- uncooked
   2      cups          onion -- 1/2 inch dice
     3/4  cup           green bell pepper -- 1/2 inch dice
   1      teaspoon      sugar

   5 1/4  cups          tomato juice
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

1. In a large stockpot, cook the bacon until just crisp, then remove. In the bacon fat, sauté the onions until semi-soft. Add the green pepper and sauté until semi-soft.

2. Add the rice and sauté over medium heat, stirring to coat in the oil for 2-3 minutes. Add the juices and bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 1 minute.

3. Add the sugar, baking soda, salt and pepper. Lower the heat to a low temperature and cook until half the liquid is gone.

4. Pour the mixture into casserole dishes, cover and bake about 25 minutes at 350F. Uncover and cook more if not all the moisture has evaporated (~10 minutes). Stir in the bacon just prior to service.

NOTES : I prefer to add more vegetables than indicated in this recipe, so
be liberal (to your liking) as to the amounts you add. I also prefer to use the one pot method for making this dish: as the
bacon begins to render its fat, add the vegetables, then the rice, then
the liquids and spices; continue as the recipe indicates; I've had
success cooking the whole dish on the stovetop (no baking).
This recipe is for a large number of people and approximates how I would
prepare red rice to serve at a BBQ or oyster roast.

   2      tablespoons   butter
   2      ounces        ground dried Red Savina Habanero

Heat liquid ingredients to about 100 F. Pour into canister. Put in dry ingredients, yeast last. Set machine to desired finish. Done. I'll leave it to individuals to try and figure out how to adapt this to their own style of bread making. Like I said, this is for one of those auto bread machines simply because I don't know how to bake bread otherwise. If it ain't easy, I ain't got time to do it. I'm sure there are lots of different herb combinations that could be used as well. Hope you all have fun with this!

NOTES : "The ricado used in this dish is the basis for many Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a suckling pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana leaves, baked in   a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather this paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my   favorite appetizers is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.       "... Quintana Roo oregano comes from a tree, not a shrub, and the long leaves turn black when they dry. Mexican oregano can be substituted for it."

  10      pounds        beef brisket

Most barbecue in Texas revolves around beef, and more specifically, brisket. When you select your brisket, choose only "packer trimmed" briskets in the ten to twelve pound category. The smaller briskets don't have enough fat to tenderize them, and the larger ones could have come off of a tough old range bull that no amount of cooking will ever tenderize. Avoid closely trimmed or "value packed" brisket pieces. The fat that was cut off to make 'em pretty is the very stuff that would have made them tender! All briskets have a fat cover on one side. Ignore this! Squeeze the thick end with both thumbs. When you've found the brisket with the smallest fat kernel, that's the one for you. Take it home and build your fire. While your fire is getting going--I build mine out of a mixture of mesquite and oak--rub your brisket with a dry "rub." [See Red's Dry Rub recipe] Make sure that the meat is thoroughly coated. This helps seal the meat, and adds a flavorful crust.

Thoroughly coat all surfaces of the brisket with lemon juice, and rub in well. Sprinkle dry rub generously all over the brisket, rubbing in well. Make sure that the brisket is entirely covered.

When the wood has burned down, move the coals to one side of the pit, place the meat away from the direct heat, fat side up (let gravity and nature do the basting), and close the pit. Some people add a pan of water near the coals to provide added moisture, but I don't. Now, don't touch the meat for 12 hours. Just drink a few beers, cook a pot of beans, and tend your fire. You'd like to hold the cooking temperature around 210F. in the brisket cooking area. Since "helpers" usually show up at the first whiff of smoke, you probably ought to put some of your leftover rub on a couple of racks of pork ribs and toss them on the pit, in the hotter end, and baste and turn 'em for four and five hours, just to keep the animals at bay. Meanwhile, see Red's Prize Winnin' Pintos recipe to keep you busy.

Back at the pit, after the twelve hours are completed, generously slather the brisket with a basting sauce (not a barbecue sauce), wrap it tightly in aluminum foil, and return to the pit. [See Red's Basting Sauce recipe] Close off all of the air supplies to the fire, and allow the meat to "set" in the pit for three or four hours. This really tenderizes the meat.  Serve your brisket with beans, coleslaw, jalapenos, onions, pickles, and plenty of bread. Cold beer or iced tea are the traditional beverages of choice.

You'll find that a ten-pound brisket will yield about 8-16 servings, depending on the individual brisket, and the size of the appetites of the guests.

   2      whole         chickens -- 4 LB or larger *
   2                    lemon -- quartered
   2      medium        onion -- quartered
   4      sprigs        fresh rosemary
   4      cloves        garlic -- halved
                        black pepper
                        vegetable oil
                        Tabasco sauce

Probably the most abused food on any barbeque pit is the poor old chicken.  I don't know how many times good manners have been challenged by being served a blackened fowl that is still raw in the middle.  There is no escape, so you pick around the edges, then beat a hasty retreat, hopefully, unobserved.

Generally, there are two mistakes that lead to this travesty.  First, the bird is cooked over a fire that is much too hot.  If you remember that frying chicken takes about 45 minutes, and that the oil is ideally at 360 to 375F., then you begin to see that barbecuing, a less efficient cooking method, should take longer.  And longer has to mean at a lower temperature level, or you wind up with the well-known charcoal effect.  Secondly, many people feel that the clucker just has to be basted, and so they buy a bottle of commercial tomato-based sauce.  Here comes the second layer of charring!!

Just for grins, try out my method and see if the results aren't just a little more pleasing.

Rinse the chickens thoroughly inside and out, discarding the neck and giblets.  Stuff each chicken with one lemon, one onion, 2 sprigs of rosemary, and two cloves of garlic.  Sprinkle each bird with black pepper.  Place the birds in a covered barbecue pit, away from the direct heat and close the pit.  Hold the temperature in the pit at about 250F for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours.

Baste the birds occasionally with the cooking oil that has been seasoned to your liking with the Tabasco Sauce.  When the chickens are a nice rich brown color, and the drumstick wiggles freely, they're done.

*Whole chickens hold their juices better and come out much more moist.  Larger birds have more fat and are better candidates for this method of cooking.  If you're doing halved cluckers, then baste more frequently, and watch the cooking time.  It should be about an hour less.

   2      tablespoons   chili powder

     1/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   2                    bay leaves

Melt the butter, add the onions and garlic, and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes to soften. Add the beer, squeeze in the lemon juice, and add the lemon rinds to the pot. When the foam subsides, add all of the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a medium low and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep baste warm, adding beer and oil as needed.

By the way, you'll notice that there are no tomatoes, ketchup, or sugar in this recipe. All of those things caramelize and burn quickly, giving the meat a black color and nasty taste.

Very few cities love a party more than San Antonio, Texas.  A major part of San Antonio's annual Fiesta is a celebration called "Night in Old San Antonio", held in La Villita, the restored original little village of San Antonio.  It's impossible to eat a sample of all of the foods sold, at least for the normal person, but one of the most popular is anticuchos--chunks of beef that have been marinated in a secret pepper marinade, skewered, and grilled over an open fire.  Since nobody has offered a recipe, I made one up.  Since you are going to hand a skewer full of meat to each guest, you really should hand them a cold beer for the other hand to preserve proper balance.

Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive (not metal) dish and allow to marinate for one to two hours.  Divide meat evenly between four skewers, and grill over very hot coals for 1-2 minutes per side (4-8 minutes total cooking time, basting with the remaining marinade at each turning.  You may wish to cook the meat longer if you prefer it beyond medium rare.  You can also reduce the size of the servings and use this recipe for hot hors d'oeuvres.

   1      cup           tomatoes -- peel, dice, chill

In this part of the country, the table fish of choice is the catfish--at least it's the most common.  You can usually order this fish prepared any way that you like it, as long as it's fried.  Now, I've no complaints with a well-fried catfish, but there had to be another way.

So a couple of nights ago, a few friends were over and we tried out this idea.  Our "impartial" panel of judges decided that this was a definite keeper, and we are pleased to pass it on to you, literally, hot off the grill!

Combine the first eight ingredients in a blender and coarsely blend.  Place the filets in a non-reactive container large enough to hold them in a single layer.  Pour the marinade over the filets and cover.  Turn the filets once after thirty minutes.  After a total marinating time of no more than one hour (any longer and they'll start to fall apart), grill them quickly over very hot mesquite coals, about 2-4 minutes per side, basting with the marinade.  Place each filet on a plate, and top with 1/4 cup of chilled chopped tomatoes.

   1      teaspoon      cayenne pepper
   1                    8 oz bottle herb and garlic oil-based -- salad dressing

   1                    bay leaf
   3      pounds        skirt steak

About twelve to fifteen years ago, fajitas were "discovered." since then, an awful lot of good meat has been wrecked, and skirt steak--once a "grinder" item--has risen sharply in price.  Because skirt doesn't come from a "tender quadrant" of the carcass, some care is needed to turn it into good food.  First, it needs to be marinated to tenderize and flavor it.

Mix all the ingredients together, except the meat, to make a marinade.  Pour over the skirt steak, in a non-reactive container (not metal), cover, and stir occasionally for six to eight hours.

Fajitas can be cooked in several ways.  If you have the space, smoke the fajitas for 30 minutes with pure mesquite smoke, and then cook for 4-7 minutes per side over direct heat--mesquite coals being the heat of choice.  Baste with the marinade throughout the cooking process.  If you need to cook completely over direct heat, then use a fairly slow fire, about like you should use when grilling chicken, and cook, covered if possible, for about 10 - 15 minutes per side, basting with the marinade.

Figure about a half pound of meat and 3 to 4 tortillas per person.  When slicing fajitas, you'll notice that the grain of the skirt steak all runs the same way.  If you'll slice the skirt at a forty-five degree angle to the grain, and hold your knife on a forty-five degree angle as well, you'll find that the fajitas are much more tender! Serve the fajitas with flour tortillas, pico de gallo salsa, guacamole, and cold beer.  You'll notice that I didn't say anything about chicken fajitas--that's a contradiction in terms.

Wash and stab chicken pieces with a fork (pork can be used as well).  Marinate chicken for 1 hour at room temperature, or a few hours to overnight in the fridge.  Pork marinates very fast, and it will be HOT if you marinate overnight. Ingredients can be modified depending on how hot you like it--if you like it HOT (with a capital H-O-T), use more habaneros, lots of Melinda's hot sauce, and marinate overnight.  If you want to tone it down a bit, use milder peppers (serrano or jalapeno) and reduce marinating time. 
Grill chicken (or pork), basting with reserved marinade, or bake at 400F. (40 minutes or more for chicken, 30 minutes for thin cuts of pork).  The reserved marinade is also great brushed on red/yellow bell peppers which you grill along with the chicken.  Grab a cold beer, and enjoy!

     1/2  pound         smoked bacon -- sliced or cubed
   1 1/2  cups          bacon fat, lard, or drippings -- [see note]
   2      medium        onions -- sliced
   6      cloves        garlic, lightly roasted and minced
   1      teaspoon      black pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      ground cloves
   2      teaspoons     ground allspice
     1/4  cup           ground coriander seed
   1 1/2  cups          brown sugar
     1/2  cup           molasses
   3      cups          malt or cider vinegar
   1      7 oz. can     chipotle chilies in adobo (to taste)
   1      pound         ham hocks or smoked bones
   1      quart         ketchup
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce

1.  In a large sauce pot render the bacon on low to medium heat until it is lightly browned all over.  Add the bacon fat or drippings and onions (see notes) and continue cooking until the onions begin to brown.  Add in the garlic, pepper, clove, allspice and coriander and cook for one minute. Add the brown sugar and molasses and simmer for one hour (see notes).

2.  Add the vinegar, chipotles and ham hocks, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the volume is reduced by half.

3.  Add the ketchup and Worcestershire and slowly simmer for 3 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally (see notes).  Strain.

Note (added by Tony from notes taken while watching Reed make
this sauce):

1.  Drippings from a smoked brisket can (should?) be used in place of or in addition to the bacon fat.

2.  Use white onions if possible instead of yellow onions.

3.  Use a vinegar that will complement whatever beverage you're serving:  malt vinegar with beer, wine vinegar with wine, cider  vinegar with hard cider, and so on.

4.  Have the butcher split the bones.  They should be added to the bacon while rendering.  Reed also added the garlic cloves to the bacon while rendering to roast the garlic.

5.  Simmering the sauce in step 1 is done to kill the sweetness.

6.  Simmering times in step 3 are a minimum; overnight is better.

     1/4  cup           ground black pepper
     1/4  cup           paprika
     1/4  cup           turbinado sugar
   2      tablespoons   salt
   2      teaspoons     dry mustard
   1      teaspoon      cayenne
   1      6-8 lb.       Boston Pork Butt

In old Southern slang, "Mr. Brown" in the dark outside part of barbecued pork, usually the shoulder. The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Massage the pork well with about half the rub.  Transfer the pork to a plastic bag, and refrigerate it overnight.

Before you begin to barbecue, remove the pork from the refrigerator.  Pat down the butt with another coating of rub.  Let the pork sit a room temperature for about 45 minutes.

Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200-220 F. If you plan to baste the pork, stir any remaining rub into the mop (see Southern Sop recipe) ingredients in a saucepan and warm the mixture over low heat.

Transfer the pork to the smoker and cook it for about 1 1/2 hours per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 170-180F.  Mop the pork about once an hour in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style smoker.

Remove the pork from the smoker and let it sit for about 15 minutes, until cool enough to handle.  Pull off chinks of the meat, and either shred or chop them as you wish.  Make sure each serving has some of the darker, chewier Mr. Brown along with the lighter interior meat.  If you wish, serve the pork with Golden Mustard Barbecue Sauce, Carolina Red, or Vaunted Vinegar Sauce.

Editor: the recipes for the Carolina Red, and Vaunted Vinegar Sauce are included in this recipe archive.

I rub anything for the smoker at least 2 days in advance, but generally 3 or 4 days.

 Mulligan stew is said to have originated in hobo camps during the early 1900s, mulligan stew is a sort of catch-all dish of whatever is available. It usually contains meat, potatoes and vegetables in just about any combination. The name indicates that its origins might come from IRISH STEW, but it's also often compared to Kentucky BURGOO. The cook at a hobo camp responsible for putting this tasty concoction together was called a "mulligan-mixer."

If you are like most people you have never heard of much less eaten burgoo. This is one of those times its definitely best to be in the minority. Burgoo is a savory stew made from a varying array of ingredients. If is often cooked in enormous iron kettles outdoors over an open flame. Cooking can take as long as 30 hours and flavor improves as it ages. It has been said that burgoo is more of a concept than a recipe. This is because there are as many different ways to prepare burgoo as there are people who prepare it. The meats could include any or all of the following meats:
mutton (sheep/lamb), beef, pork, chicken, veal or opossum, rabbit, squirrel  You will also find some combination of these vegetables: potatoes, corn, lima beans, tomatoes, okra or green beans. Of course there are also many spices to choose from as well. As you might imagine there are many people who keep their recipes a closely guarded secret.

It is believed that the word "burgoo" originated in the 17th century on the high seas. These sailors used to subsist on an oatmeal-like porridge made from the Middle-Eastern grain, bulgur (or bulghur) wheat. The term first appears in the 1650 book "Adventures by Sea" by Edward Coxere.

Put in a heavy lidded kettle with:

3 qts. water or stock
3/4 lb. lean inch-diced stewing beef
3/4 lb. inch-diced pork shoulder

Bring pot one slowly to a boil. Reduce heat at once and slowly simmer about 2 1/2 hours.

In another heavy kettle put:

1.  One disjointed 3 1/2 lb. chicken with just enough water to cover.
2.  Bring these ingredients to a boil.
3.  Reduce the heat at once and simmer about 1 hour or until the meat can easily be removed from the bones.
4.Put the chicken meat and the water in which it was cooked into the first kettle with the other meat after it has simmered the 2 1/2 hours as directed.

At this time also add:

2 1/2 cups quartered ripe, peeled and seeded tomatoes
1 cup fresh lima beans
1/2 red diced pepper
4 diced green peppers
3/4 cup diced onion
1 cup diced carrots
2 cups diced potatoes
1 bay leaf
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Simmer this whole mixture 1/2 hour or more before adding

2 cups corn (freshly cut from cob)
Cook about 15 minutes more or until all the vegetables are soft
Correct the seasoning.

Some think  Burgoo is not Burgoo without squirrel, but then maybe that was Hunter's Stew, which was made in an old iron wash pot, out doors over a fire. To be eaten at night while listening to mountain music--hounds running a coon up and down ridges and hollers.

After the brine, I washed them out and rubbed on a nice coat of Paprika and ground black pepper. They were then finished on the Weber rotisserie at about 350F for around 2 hours, until I read 155 to 160F internal. Took them off and let them sit around (covered) for 20 minutes and ate.

   4      pounds        beef chuck roast
   4      pounds        pork butt -- (boneless)
                        **GRIND COARSE**
   2      tablespoons   salt
   1 1/2  teaspoons     ground coriander
   1 1/2  teaspoons     white pepper
   1 1/2  teaspoons     mace
   1      teaspoon      ground ginger
                        about 1.5 cups cold water
                        -- use enough water to get a good "meatloaf"

mix well

I stuff them into hog casing and twist by hand.

Smoke for about 3 hours at 115F.

Simmer in hot (170) water until they float (I just dump them in boiling water taken off the heat and then turn the flame to the smallest it will go).

I like them hot from the pot or cooled and then grilled.

Why, the simmering in water. Well, first off and most importantly, I've always done it that way. I think though, that it takes some of the salt out and gives it a different texture. 2 Tbs. salt is a bit much, and indeed when you fry up a test batch, it comes out salty. I usually also do not soak the brined hog casings overnight. I just rinse them out before I use them, this might leave them salty. Also, smoked at 115 doesn't quite cook it, steeping finishes the meat off. Now, I guess you could smoke (at 115) for a while and then raise the temp to, say, the magic 240 and continue for another while. It's just something I've never tried. I really adapted this from what we used to do on the farm in Austria, that is cold smoke and then boil.

Hope you try this and if anyone wants to try smoking the meat all the way, post the results.

     1/4  cup           regular vinegar
   1 1/2  cups          water
   1      cup           ketchup

Makes about 3 cups, but I like to reduce it a little.  Just throw all in a pot and simmer it for a while.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    possum -- whole, uncleaned
   1                    onion -- large, chopped
   1      tablespoon    bacon fat
                        possum liver
   1      cup           bread crumbs
   1      teaspoon      red pepper -- chopped
                        Worcestershire sauce -- dash
   1                    egg, hardboiled -- finely chopped
                        salt to taste

Possums are roasted with hide on, so prepare a large pot of scalding hot water. Dip possum in it for a few minutes, then remove the hair by scraping with a dull knife, as you would scrape a hog. If some hair comes off hard, dip again in scalding (not hard-boiling) water. Wash with soap and water, then remove entrails, keeping washed liver. Remove head and tail (some people keep the head on). Soak in cold water to which is added 1 cup salt. Drain and rinse with boiling water. Stuff with possum stuffing, close the opening, and roast in black iron pot with a little water for 1-1/2 hours at 350. Baste often. SEE possum stuffing recipe. Add sweet potatoes 1 hour before possum is done.

   1      teaspoon      annatto seeds -- ground

Figure that.  Believe it or not this is the second leg-o-lamb recipe I got today.  Although not Q'd, it could be Q'd easy enough.  This recipe comes from the UK so some of the measurements will require conversion or at the very least some imagination.

We had a half leg of lamb in our Christmas butchery order, and we roasted it with the following marinade/baste:

I slashed a diamond-pattern into the meat, and rubbed the marinade in.  Gave it 2 hours before cooking it at 375F for 75 minutes on a bed of sliced potatoes.  Very tasty!

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16      small         yellow onions, 2 inches in diameter
   1      teaspoon      granulated sugar
     1/4  cup           chicken broth
   3      tablespoons   butter, unsalted

To prepare the onions take a sharp knife and trim the root end of each onion flat, so that it will remain intact, but stand. Standing each onion on its flat-cut end, cut parallel vertical slices at 1/4-inch intervals into, but not through onion, stopping about 3/4 inch above root end. Rotate each onion 90F and cut parallel vertical slices in same manner to form a crosshatch pattern, keeping onions intact.

Place onions, flat side down in a lightly buttered shallow baking dish that is large enough to let onions open, or flower, as they bake. Sprinkle with sugar and salt to taste. In a small saucepan heat broth and butter over moderately high heat until butter is melted and pour over onions. Cover onions with foil and roast for 45-minutes in a pre-heated 450F oven. Remove foil and continue to roast onions, basting occasionally, 30 to 45-minutes longer, on until golden. Onions may be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated, covered. Reheat onions for 15 to 20 minutes in a 325F oven before serving. 
Note: This Thanksgiving Day Dinner recipe provides both a tasty side dish and an eye-pleasing display on your holiday table. We've added it to our E=Experimental menu because it goes well with the peppers already stuffed into your turkey and you won't serve a gravy. Don't hesitate to prepare this dish at any time of the year, especially when the Vidalias are fresh and sweet. Cooking time will very with the size of the onion, so our best advice is to make sure they're all comparable in size.

Preheat the oven to 350F. Toss the tomatoes in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until soft. Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor and process until smooth. Strain the tomatoes, pressing against the solids with a wooden spoon to extract as much pulp and juice as possible. Heat the remaining olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat and sauté the onions and garlic until translucent. Add the tomato puree and remaining ingredients and continue cooking, uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until thick.

Roasted Vegetables

Long-Cook Group (35 minutes)

Potatoes
Onions
Carrots
Beets
Turnips
Sweet Potatoes
-------

Medium-Cook Group (20 minutes)

Brussels Sprouts
Fennel Bulbs (cut in half or quartered)
Garlic (whole cloves, peeled)
Leeks
Whole Okra
Whole Pearl Onions
Peppers (hot and/or sweet, quartered)
Summer Squash and Zucchini (in sections)
-------

Short-Cook Group (5 minutes)

Cabbage (cut in wedges)
Mushroom caps
-------

Peel the tough skinned vegetables and cut large ones into about 2 inch wedges. Select the vegetables you want from each group; have them grouped and ready by cooking times.

Preheat your oven to 475F. Put about 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a shallow roasting pan. Add your long cook vegetables, toss to coat with oil, and sprinkle them with soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes, tossing once or twice in order to sear all sides.

Now add your medium cook vegetables, tossing to coat with oil, and sprinkle them with the same sauces you used before. Continue roasting for another 15 minutes.

Finally, add your short cook vegetables. Sprinkle with one tablespoon of herbed vinegar, a few dashes of Tabasco sauce, and add a few leaves of thyme if desired (or fresh basil is good, too). Roast all vegetables for another 5 minutes, remove from oven, and serve.

   1      quart         Cattlemen's smoky barbecue sauce
     1/2  cup           margarine
     1/2  cup           brown sugar -- packed
   2      teaspoons     roasted garlic pepper - to taste
   1 1/2  tablespoons   chipotle sauce - to taste

Melt butter in saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir until melted. Stir in the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 15 minutes. Can be served immediately, but best if allowed to chill over night.

Note: The chipotle sauce is not the adobo kind that has been discussed on the List in the past. This is the Bufalo (their spelling) brand, "Chipotle Mexican Hot Sauce" that's made in Mexico, and distributed by the Herdez Co. out of Carlsbad, CA. It's labeled as "very hot" but don't believe it! It's pretty mild.

   2      tablespoons   butter

Put the honey in a stainless steel container and put it into the pit for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  The honey takes on a nice, smoky flavor.  Then remove it from the pit and add an equal amount of yellow mustard to the honey, followed by a half a cup of BBQ sauce, and two tablespoons of butter.  Heat and stir until butter melts and ingredients are mixed well.

Then with a good paint brush style basting brush, coat the ribs liberally as they come out of the pit.  They're hot enough to melt the mixture forming a nice, sweet and tangy glaze.

   2      teaspoons     all-purpose flour
   2      teaspoons     dry mustard powder
     1/4  cup           plus 1 tablespoon sugar
   1      pinch         ground cayenne pepper
   1                    heaping teaspoon salt
     1/3  cup           apple cider vinegar
     2/3  cup           heavy cream
   2      large         egg yolks
   1      tablespoon    caraway seeds
   1 1/2  tablespoons   prepared horseradish
                        ***COLESLAW***
   6      cups          white cabbage--about 1 1/4 pounds -- finely sliced
   1                    carrot, grated
   1 3/4  cups          red cabbage--about 1/2 pound -- sliced very fine

Red cabbage heightens the flavor and color of this coleslaw, but more white cabbage can be substituted.

Dressing. In the top of a double boiler, off the heat, combine the flour, mustard powder, sugar, cayenne, and salt. Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in the bottom of the double boiler. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar and cream and bring to a boil over high heat. Whisk the hot vinegar mixture into the dry ingredients, then place the top of the double boiler over the simmering water. Whisk in the egg yolks and stir until the mixture thickens slightly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the caraway seeds and horseradish. Cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate until chilled.

In a large bowl mix whipped topping, pineapple, condensed milk, whipping cream, vanilla pudding mix, and vanilla extract.

Alternate layers of vanilla wafers, sliced bananas and above mixture into a 4 quart dish ending with vanilla wafers on top of mixture. Do not top with banana slices as the bananas will turn brown. You will need the juice from the pineapple because the pudding will get to thick without it.

     3/4  cup           honey
     1/2  cup           Triple Sec
     1/4  cup           oil

Poured about 3/4 cup honey in a bowl, then add Triple Sec until it was thin enough to mop, (about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup) then added a 1/4 cup of oil. 
I can see where this stuff would really act like a smoke glue so a little smoke goes a long way.  I pre-burn wood for coals so I have very little smoke from my heat source.  I basted once before putting the bird in and then again about every 30 minutes.  It came out looking almost perfect.  If you use heavy smoke, you may want to wait an hour or so before mopping with this mixture.

Some tomato sauces and ketchup are sweeter than others. Bring to a low simmer, do not boil. Cook until mixture attains the desired thickness, usually about 2 hours. Yield: about 3 gallons

   2      tablespoons   butter
   1      cup           BBQ sauce

Bake pie crust until golden brown.  Boil or microwave potatoes until tender (skin or off), drain water, add butter, and mash. (I like to leave them slightly lumpy).  Spoon enough potatoes into baked pie crust to fill pan about half way.  Mix pulled beef with enough BBQ sauce to cover and mix thoroughly.  Spoon beef/sauce mix on top of potatoes to fill pie crust.  Pour extra sauce on top. 
Cover pie with grated cheese and finally top cheese with jalapeno slices.  Bake in 350F oven until cheese is melted and pie is hot throughout.  It would be just as easy to make up several of these and freeze one or two for later use.

Roast eggplants in/over moderate heat until they completely collapse.  (I do them in the oven; my dad does them on the grill; bet they'd be great in a smoker.)

Scoop flesh into a bowl; break up any remaining lumps with a fork.  Add onion, oil, salt and lots of pepper.  Chill.  Terrific on sour rye or pumpernickel.  Some people add chopped tomatoes, but my grandma didn't so I don't.

The fat in Roux, coats the molecules of flour.  That keeps the flour from absorbing liquid and the molecules take up a lot of "space" in the pot. This is the thickening action.  The important thing to know is that the more you cook the Roux, the less time that you have between adding it to food and cooking that food, if you don't want the Roux to loose it's thickening properties.  Flour just don't hold up for long.

Also.  If you DON'T cook the Roux enough (either on it's own or in the pot), then you will make the food that you are cooking taste like flour. Catastrophe.  You just gotta get it right.  This will help.  Think of roux as being one of 4 types. BLOND BLANC D'OR BRUN.

Blond roux  is useful to thicken a soup or sauce that you want to keep white. You have to cook that sauce until the flour taste is gone.  Then kill the heat and serve.

Blond roux is also good for soup or sauce, and you can add it last minute.

D'Ore (gold) roux is useful to thicken a stew.  It's darker and will give you time to get it stirred in and served, before it starts to give out.  It doesn't have to be cooked with the stew to get the flour taste out.

Brun is a last minute roux.  It won't hold up, but you do get a great dark color, and a nutty flavor from the well cooked flour.

To cook the roux.  Melt butter in a pan and then add an equal quantity of flour as you stir.  The final roux, will be crumbly when hot, and a hard ball when cold.

Cook the flour until a patena or a "finish" comes to the roux.  It looks like a powdery finish.  This is BLOND.  If you cook it a little longer the patina vanishes, it becomes a BLANC.  When it starts to change color, it is useless for a white sauce as it changes color to gold.  This is D'ORE.  With a little more cooking it'll turn brown.  This is BRUN.

Always remove roux from the pan and let it cool a moment.  Then add it to the food in the pot.  A little goes a long way.  You can store it in a ball tightly wrapped in plastic wrap.

This is a good time to mention that cooking is not a science.  It's alchemy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           brown sugar
     1/8  cup           salt -- (to 1/4 cup)
     1/8  cup           black pepper
     1/8  cup           cherry pepper*
   1      ounce         chile powder
   1      ounce         sage or poultry seasoning
   1      teaspoon      cinnamon -- (secret ingredient)

* cherry peppers are small chile peppers.

Rub the tenderloin and let it sit for a few hours. Smoke with a mild wood for 1-2 hours. Don't let the tenderloin get over 165F internal temperature or it'll start drying out like a field of hay in a Texas drought. Tenderloins are great to smoke in a short time and this rub is mighty tasty.

Last Labor Day I asked about a rub for pork loin. Bill Martin sent my this awesome rub that creates a sweet, caramel tasting tenderloin. Since I had to make up a new batch, I thought I'd share it, with Bill's permission of course. And since Bill didn't tell me about his brisket session on Saturday, I've included the secret ingredient.

                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  15 3/8  ounces        cider vinegar
   4 1/3  teaspoons     black pepper
   2 1/8  teaspoons     cayenne pepper
   1 1/2  ounces        salt

First off, the secrets are not mine.  I owe Mr. Motley a debt of gratitude for sharing them, even if it was in a purchased book.  He recommends using a scale to weight the dry ingredients for consistency so I'm giving both the volume and dry weight of them. He figures the yield of a Boston butt to be 60% to 65% of the original
weight.  This is for 6 pounds of finished meat.
 Put the dry ingredients in a pot and as you add the vinegar a little at a time.  Do not let it come to a boil.  Slowly add in the vinegar and stir to dissolve the solids as best you can.  All you should see is some black pepper if it is well mixed. 
Vinegar has a lower boiling point than water and if you boil some of it off the ratios will change.  This should be ready when you take the meat off the fire to process it. 
The secret is to process the meat while it is hot.  The hotter the meat is, the easier it is for the seasonings to penetrate it. This allows the seasonings to penetrate better.  The meat should be chopped and all the fat that is left on is, including any fat that is running out while processing. The skin should be chopped by hand until it is a mush consistency.  The skin is full of flavor and smoke.  Scrape all the fat off of it and start chopping. 
After mixing the meat and seasonings, put it in the refrigerator for about 24 hours.  Then gently heat it in a double boiler.  Overheating will vaporize the vinegar. 
Cooking the meat:

Most BBQers here cook a picnic with the skin up so the fat will render and baste the meat.  Ryland does his skin down so the skin is crisped up a bit and has a better flavor. 
Hope this helps some.  It is not easy to condense a dozen pages to a few paragraphs and maintain the authenticity of the author.

     1/4  cup           paprika

     1/8  cup           celery salt

   1      tablespoon    ground ginger
   1      teaspoon      cumin
   1      teaspoon      ground cloves

For heat, I'd use cayenne pepper, add perhaps 1 tbs. and taste, then add more if desired. You can also use hot sauces with your rub (sprinkle lightly on the meat then apply your rub). The flavors of a rub are intense; don't be misled into thinking you're going to have flavors this strong on your meats. After cooking for extended periods of time, the flavors will distill down and become much less intense.

     1/4  cup           molasses
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
   1      tablespoon    thyme
   1      tablespoon    oregano
                        ***MOP***
   1      cup           vinegar
   1      cup           water
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      tablespoon    pepper
     1/4  cup           margarine

Mix all the brine ingredients in a large container. Trim and prepare the chicken as desired (I like to split the birds in half--they lay on the cooking surface better and are easier to handle). Immerse chicken in brine and soak for 4 - 24 hours. Remove from brine, rinse briefly, rub (if desired), and cook until internal breast temp hits 165 - 170F.

I like to remove them, place them in a disposable aluminum pan (covered) and let them "rest" for approx. 15 minutes. The only trouble with this is the skin gets somewhat "leathery" using this method, and you need to slap them on a grill (direct heat) for a few minutes to crisp the skin back up. You can, if you desire, apply a thin coating of barbecue sauce during the crisping phase.

You may want to mop/baste the birds while cooking. Put mop ingredients in sauce pan and bring to a boil. I baste them once or twice during the process, then finish them off with a honey/butter glaze (instead of barbecue sauce). Mix 3 parts butter/margarine with 1 part honey and coat birds thoroughly during the last few moments of the crisping phase.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 3/4  pounds        small shrimp -- (see notes)
   2      tablespoons   unsalted butter
   1      tablespoon    vegetable oil
     1/2  cup           canned tomato sauce
   3      tablespoons   onions -- chopped very fine
   2 1/2  tablespoons   green bell peppers -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   celery -- chopped very fine
   1      teaspoon      minced garlic
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      white pepper
   1      teaspoon      dried thyme leaves
     1/2  teaspoon      ground cayenne pepper
   1 1/2  cups          basic shrimp stock
     1/2  cup           heavy cream
   3 1/2  cups          basic cooked rice
     3/4  cup           green onions finely chopped
   1      cup           packed lump crabmeat (1/2 pound)

NOTE: If shrimp with heads are not available, buy 1 pound shrimp with shells and substitute other seafood ingredients for the heads in making the seafood stock. Peel the shrimp and use the heads and shells to make the stock; refrigerate shrimp until ready to use. In a large skillet melt the butter with the oil. Add the tomato sauce, onions, bell peppers, celery, garlic, salt, white pepper, thyme and cayenne pepper; sauté over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the stock and continue cooking over high heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the rice, green onions and crabmeat, keeping the lumps of crabmeat intact as much as possible. Heat through and serve immediately.

   4      tablespoons   black pepper
   4      tablespoons   white pepper

Be sure to use the actual POWDERED onion and garlic; onion salt and garlic salt just won't do!
This seasoning is used on meat after curing and before smoking, for example in the making of jerky.  The meat has already absorbed enough salt while curing--that is why this recipe contains no salt, and why garlic or onion salt should not be used.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***DRY RUB***
     2/3  cup           dark brown sugar -- packed
     1/4  cup           paprika
   2      tablespoons   garlic powder
   1      tablespoon    cayenne pepper
   1      tablespoon    black pepper
   1      tablespoon    white pepper
   2      teaspoons     coriander -- ground
   1      teaspoon      salt
                        ***THE MOP***
   1      tablespoon    butter
   1      each          medium onion -- grated
   8      each          cloves garlic -- minced
   1      each          12 oz can tomato paste
   1      cup           red wine vinegar
     1/2  cup           water
     1/2  cup           molasses
     1/2  cup           packed dark brown sugar
   3      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   3      tablespoons   chili powder
   1      tablespoon    dry mustard

These instructions are for beginning smoke/cooker enthusiasts.  It should work equally well in the Brinkmann type of water/cookers as well as most other cookers.  The main requirement is the ability to maintain the cooking chamber temperature between 180 and 250F and the cooker must have a water pan to maintain the humidity close to 100%.

Add all of the ingredients for the rub into a Ziploc bag and mix thoroughly.  Add the ribs, shake thoroughly to ensure complete covering of the ribs and store in the refrigerator overnight.

About 5 1/2 - 6 hours before you plan on serving the ribs, fire up the smoker and make the sauce.  To make the sauce, sauté the onion and garlic in a little oil until golden brown.  Then add the remaining ingredients and stir frequently until everything is totally dissolved.  Cook on simmer for about 30 minutes.

Once the cooker has settle down to a good bed of coals, place the ribs on the grill over a pan of cold water.  Let smoke, covered and undisturbed for about 2 hours.  At that point, open the smoker lid and basted the ribs well with the mop, taking this opportunity to check the coals in the fire pan and the liquid level in the water pan.  Replenish as needed, adding wet wood for plenty of smoke as well.  Cook the ribs for 3 hours more, turning and basting them after 1 hour and again after 2 hours.  As always in smoke cooking, precise timing is not terribly important here.  Just keep the smoke up and the temperature between 180 and 240F and be liberal with your mopping.

By the end of their 5 hours on the grill, the ribs will have long since reached the required internal temperature of 185 for fresh pork, but you can't overdo ribs by smoking, and the long, slow cooking will have rendered them tender to a tee.

About 10 minutes before you are ready to serve the ribs, treat them to a final mop, letting it set to a tantalizingly rich glaze over what may be the most succulent ribs you've ever tasted.

For finger-licking aficionados, provide yet more hot mop sauce served up in dipping bowls.  A finger bowl for cleaning the hands will be appreciated and many, many napkins for cleaning up...  Enjoy

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/8  pounds        finely ground fatty pork
   1 1/8  pounds        finely ground veal or lamb
   1      large         onion -- finely chopped
                        or- grated
     1/2  cup           finely chopped parsley
   2      teaspoons     salt
     1/2  pound         panna -- (caul fat from pig)

Combine pork with veal or lamb, onion, parsley, salt and a generous grinding of black pepper. Dip panna into a bowl of warm water for a minute or two, remove and carefully open out a piece at a time, laying it out flat on work surface. Cut with kitchen scissors into pieces about 10 cm (4 inches) square. 
Take a good tablespoon of meat mixture and shape into a thick sausage about 5 cm (2 inches) long.  Place towards one edge of piece of panna, fold end and sides over meat and roll up firmly. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Thread sausages on flat sword-like skewers, leaving space between them. Number on each skewer depends on their length. Cook over glowing charcoal, turning frequently. Do not place too close to heat as sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that the inside is well cooked and the outside nicely browned without being burnt. The panna melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist and adding flavor. Excessive flaring of fire can be controlled by a sprinkle of water on the coals. Serve sheftalia as an appetizer or a main course.

NOTES : Taken from Seattle Times - (Parade 1995) by Sheila Lukins. This is my absolute favorite sauce. Many ingredients, but so easy to make. Last forever in the refrigerator. Taste so fresh, coats well. Especially good on grilled chicken.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      package       garlic powder small bottle
     1/2  can           red pepper -- (or to taste)
   1      pound         brown sugar
     1/2  can           chili powder
   1      can           black pepper small can
   1      gallon        white vinegar
   1      package       Worcestershire sauce small bottle
  14      pounds        ketchup -- (2 7# cans)
     1/2  pound         sausage Seasoning

Put all ingredients except ketchup in pan.  heat but do not boil.  add ketchup and remove from heat.

Dan Gill-- Here is a ketchup based sauce for the benefit of the poor misguided soul asking about store-bought sauces.  We make up the whole recipe about once a year and pour it into the vinegar bottles to store and give to friends.  I omit the sausage seasoning because I slather this on chicken more often than pork.  You can always add a little sage when using on pork.  It also makes a great table sauce.

Developed over many years by a family in Richmond, VA that put on a lot of family shindigs.  Sorry about the reference to large and small cans, etc.  This was written back when most stores carried only Sauers and McCormick and cans sizes were standard.

     1/4  cup           tarragon vinegar
   1                    minced shallots -- up to 2
   1      clove         minced Garlic -- up to 2

                        optional: Texas Pete or Tabasco Sauce

Put all ingredients in blender and whiz until smooth. In a large measuring cup, combine 1/2 cup each vegetable oil and virgin olive oil.  With the blender running SLOWLY pour in the mixed 1 cup of oil. The object is to incorporate the oil into a creamy emulsion. You may need to stop and burp the air/pooled oil from the blender.

Peel and clean 1 pound of shrimp and place in a ceramic bowl. Pour marinade over shrimp. Add some chopped fresh parsley, about 1 cup. For dried parsley use 1/4 cup. Marinate overnight in refrigerator, or 1-2 hours on counter. Cover with plastic wrap. 
When ready to grill, thread onto Bamboo skewers that have been soaked. Grill 3-4 minutes per side, depending on size of shrimp.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Barbecue Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   9      teaspoons     malt vinegar
   7      teaspoons     water
   3      teaspoons     cayenne pepper
   3      teaspoons     paprika
   2      teaspoons     nuoc nam
   1 1/2  teaspoons     Texas Pete hot sauce
   1 1/2  teaspoons     black pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      onion powder

This is an approximation of the hot table sauce served at the Silver Pig North Carolina-style barbecue restaurant in Madison Heights, Virginia. If you don't have nuoc nam (Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce), add one more teaspoon each of malt vinegar and water, and substitute one teaspoon of salt in lieu of the nuoc nam.

Simply combine all ingredients, shake well, and let sit. Give the bottle a good shake before using.

                Brisket

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

You can't mess a brisket up this way.  Trust me.

Have your butcher trim a full Brisket for you.

Rub the Brisket with your favorite rub.  Garlic Salt if nothing else.

Place on Smoker at 185F + or - 10F for 3 hours.

Take off smoker and wrap in wide foil sealing to hold in moisture.

Lay Brisket FLAT in deep pan to catch grease.

Place Brisket in oven on time bake for 4 1/2 hours at 200F.

If you want to keep messing with your smoker place the foil wrapped brisket back on the smoker and hold your temperature at 200 for  4 1/2 hours.

On slicing:  Leave  brisket in the foil until fully chilled.  Usually overnight in the refrigerator.  All meat retains moisture better if sliced after chilling.   When warmed back up it will be juicer.

If you have a hungry crew start 7 1/2 hours before meal time and chow down 7 1/2 hours later.  Its that simple

I have done well over fifty (50) briskets this way and every one has come out perfect. 
WARNING:  This brisket will easily fall apart, extremely tender.

        Smoke Shack Southern Style Sloppin' Sauce For Pulled Pork

Recipe By     :

Categories    : Bbq List                         Barbecue Sauce
                Carolina-Style Bbq Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          apple cider vinegar
   2      cups          water
   2      tablespoons   salt
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
   1      tablespoon    hot sauce
   1      tablespoon    paprika
   1      teaspoon      ginger
     1/2  teaspoon      dry mustard powder

I came up with this recipe because I just couldn't bring myself to spray apple juice on a piece of pork, which everyone seemed to be doing at the time. I was brought up to believe barbecue should taste like barbecue - not like applesauce. Here in the South, barbecue has a tangy, somewhat salty/hot flavor, and should never, under any circumstances, be sweet.

Mix all the ingredients together - except for the salt* - in a stainless steel pot. Bring just to a boil, then simmer for a minute or two (this helps cut the bite of the vinegar). Add the salt, stir until dissolved, then remove from heat and allow to cool. Makes 4 cups.

Use this as you would a marinade for pork or chicken. If you wish to use this as a baste, you should add oil (I add 1/2 - 3/4 cup margarine to mine for the flavor and oil) and heat thoroughly. I also add beer to the mix. You can, of course, add hot sauce to your heart's content.

*Never add salt to a liquid in a stainless steel pot unless the liquid is hot/boiling. Salt will of course sink, and if it is not quickly dissolved will pit your expensive pot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           all-purpose flour
   1                    big pinch salt
     1/2  teaspoon      baking soda -- (heaping)
   1      teaspoon      double acting baking powder
   1 1/2  tablespoons   brown sugar or 1 tsp. white sugar
   1      cup           plain yellow, blue, or white cornmeal
   2      large         eggs
   1 1/2  cups          buttermilk
   3      tablespoons   melted smoked bacon dripping -- or in a
   1      pinch         substitute butter or olive oil

Preheat over to 425F. Combine the first 5 dry ingredients and stir until well mixed. Then stir in the cornmeal. Stir the liquid into the dry ingredients. In separate bowl, combine eggs, buttermilk and drippings and beat until smooth.

Have ready 1 1/2 cups Hormel Cracklings. I like the cracklings chopped up kind of fine. Toss out any that might break a tooth. Hormel's the best brand, unless you can get some from a barbecue place that does a lot of pork and sells the skin as cracklings. Add and stir the cracklings into the batter with a few quick strokes. Pour batter into a preheated 10 inch cast- iron skillet greased with bacon drippings. Bake for twenty-five minutes at 425F on the oven's top shelf. Serve with barbecued pork-enhanced bean soup, and try dunking the crackling corn bread into the soup as you would a steak sandwich into au jus sauce.

Plantains should be bought and used way before they go soft. Remember, this is just a big potato in a banana skin.

The nice thing is you can do these over a fire, the same way you do bananas.

Here are two ways to fix them:

1 with salt and pepper and BBQ rub 2 with cinnamon and brown or powdered sugar.

Slice the FIRM bananas or plantains lengthwise. If you get the really big plantains, you may have to also cut them in half. Throw the pieces gently into a plastic zip lock bag with the cinnamon-sugar or rub mix. Bananas go better with the sugar mix, plantains with either, but usually the rub and/or just salt and pepper.

Put these on the spot on your smoker grill where you would expect to put a steak or hamburger, with a fairly hot fire. Cook as follows:

Bananas-- Only until the sugar caramelizes and gets real gooey, lift off with a spatula. Don't let 'em cook too long or they get so soft you won't be able to get 'em off.

Plantains-- Cook until they soften like a potato and have a little golden brown showing on the outside.

If you can get the little, fat, sweet/tart Chinese apple bananas for this dessert--all the better.

     1/2  cup           salt
     1/2  cup           sugar

   1      tablespoon    rosemary
   1      tablespoon    basil
   1      each          honey -- for basting

Place turkey in brine for 8-12 hours.  Remove from brine.  Rinse well and air dry.  Place turkey in the smoker with both upper and lower cavities open to expose the insides to smoke.  Smoke 3-3 1/2 hours or longer being careful not to dry bird out.

Remove turkey from the smoker and cook in your favorite way.  If you desire more smoke flavor, simply increase smoking time and the amount of fuel used.  Reduce your cooking time by 10% for each hour in the smoker (up to 40%).

If you are using a smoker/barbeque/roaster type of barbeque, switch modes to roast mode and baste the turkey with honey during the roasting time.

Add remaining ingredients, pan drippings from the smoker, 2 tablespoons of basil garlic vinegar, water,  and cook for an additional hour, or until vegetables are soft. If you choose, you may add flour to the liquid in the Dutch oven to make a thick gravy or roux.

NOTES : Bear meat should be assumed to carry trichinosis, so be sure the internal temperature of the roast at it's thickest point reaches at least 170F--I take it on up to 190F just to be on the safe side.

                        blue fish fillets
                        kosher salt
                        coarse ground pepper
                        fennel

Here in Virginia, Bluefish took over the Chesapeake Bay about 20 years ago and ate up all of the good fish. They were fun to catch but then we had to figure out how to make them palatable. The answer was smoking. We also found that fennel compliments blue and other oily fish. This is the tall herb that grows wild around here and tastes like licorice; not the Florence fennel with the big root. The association of oily fish and fennel goes back for centuries. The French would use the herb, then put the stalks on the cooking fire for more flavor.

Scale and fillet blue and freeze. Freezing ruptures cells and the fish smoke better. When ready to smoke, thaw and layer fillets in a glass baking dish covering each layer with kosher salt. Leave at room temperature for 1 to 4 hours, rinse briefly, and allow to air dry for about an hour while you prepare the smoker. Place skin side down on wire racks and sprinkle liberally with coarse ground pepper. Also sprinkle liberally with either oregano or fennel (leaves or seeds, fresh or dry) or with both. Smoke for 6 to 10 hours at 170F. If you have access to the whole fennel plant, try using the dry stems to supplement your wood smoke. Check for doneness: The outside should have a dark bronze glazed look and the meat should flake easily. Cooked fish freeze well. Serve as appetizer with sharp cheese, crackers and white wine (sorry 'bout that, Bear).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   6      pounds        pork butt
   1      large         onion -- diced
   4      tablespoons   ground New Mexican chile
   1      tablespoon    cumin seed -- roasted and ground
   2      teaspoons     granulated garlic
   1      teaspoon      dry oregano
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      black pepper
                        to cover water

Smoke the pork butt with your favorite wood at a low temperature for about three hours.  You might even consider boning it and cutting it in two pieces.  The idea here is to get the smoke flavor and NOT to cook it till it is tender.  Once you think you have plenty of smoke on   the butt, transfer it to a large pot.  Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over high  heat.  Reduce the heat to a hard simmer and cook, stirring occasionally for about 2 hours.  When stirring, stir hard, trying to break the pork up.  When the water is gone, but there is still  plenty of moisture, the pork is done.

NOTES : This is excellent meat for use in tacos.  To make tacos, heat two small corn tortillas on a hot plate.  Fill hot tortilla with some of the carnitas.  Add a big spoonful of freshly made Pico De Gallo and your  favorite salsa or hot sauce.  The tacos should be eaten on a double tortilla.  The inside tortilla soaks up all the juices, while the outside tortilla stays dry so you can handle it without making a mess.  The smoked carnitas would also be great as a filling for taquitos.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        catfish fillets
   2      quarts        warm water
   1      quart         apple juice
   1      quart         pineapple juice
   2      cups          non-iodized salt
   1                    5 gallon plastic bucket

Well I would have to say catfish is the best smoked fish.  Here is what I do.

First you want nothing over about 6 pounds. I would just use those larger ones for pan frying.

Do not skin the fish, leave the skins on (this helps keep more of the oil in the meat.)  The catfish should be filleted (cut along the backbone). 
Mix the apple juice, pineapple juice and salt together in the water until you feel no salt on the bottom of the bucket.

Now take you a glass baking dish and layer your meat with the first skin to the bottom, now the next layer will be meat down. Continue this meat to meat skin to skin. You never want the skin to touch the meat.  When finished layering, pour brine over the meat so that meat is covered.  Put plastic wrap over the dish.

Put in refrigerator for about a minimum of 24 hrs. to a max of 36 hrs.

Now as far as the smoking goes it is more like a slow cooking. I cook directly over the hot coals and the wet chips. I keep the temperature around 150F and I use alder chips or a mixture of peach and alder. I have a Brinkmann pit but again I do not use the side boy for this.

The fish will be done when you see the skin turn dark brown or almost black and the flesh will be firm but soft.

Take off pit let and cool for about 30 minutes then eat by pealing off the skin.  It should just about fall off the meat.

Leave the skin on until you are ready to eat it.

I have kept it in the refrigerator for about 2 weeks and freezer for 4 months with no problem.

Cheese is a delicate food that must be handled with care when smoking.  Usually hard cheeses, such as cheddar, Edam, provolone, or Swiss are smoked.  Of course, there are a host of other hard cheeses, including many imports, that are excellent choices for smoking.  Softer varieties may be smoked, although their flavor is not always as compatible with smoking.

The first step is to remove all wax, rind, or protective wrapping.  Cheese pieces should not exceed two inches in thickness. Slices are handy when smoking small amounts for individual meals or snacks.  For larger quantities, cut the cheese into slabs or bars.  Most commercially packaged cheeses available in the supermarket come in convenient-size cuts and are just right for smoking.

Smoke cheese at as low a temperature as possible; 70 to 80F is good.  A light volume of smoke is VERY important.  If smoke clouds too heavily in the smoker, it will result in the cheese having a sooty or bitter taste.

One to three hours of smoking offers a good flavor range in cheese.  Watch for the characteristic amber color to appear and sample your cheese as it smokes to determine the level of flavor it has acquired.  The smoking process will cause a small loss of moisture, resulting in a corresponding shrinkage and loss of weight, but all the nutrients will still remain in the cheese.

Whether refrigerated or stored at room temperature, cheese that has been smoked will not mold or spoil as quickly as unsmoked cheese.

                        **SEE BELOW**

It is possible to make chipotle in the back yard with a meat smoker or Weber-type barbecue with a lid. The grill should be washed to remove any meat particles because any odor in the barbecue will give the chile an undesirable flavor. Ideally, the smoker or barbecue should be new and dedicated only to smoking chilies.

The quality of homemade chipotle will depend on the maturity and quality of the pods, the moisture in the pods, the temperature of the smoke drying the pods, and the amount of time the peppers are exposed to the smoke and heat. The aroma of wood smoke will flavor the jalapenos, so carefully choose what is burned. Branches from fruit trees, or other hardwoods such as hickory, oak, and pecan, work superbly. Pecan is used extensively in parts of Mexico and in southern New Mexico to flavor chipotle. Do not be afraid to experiment with different woods.

The difference between the fresh weight of the fruits and the finished product is about ten to one, so it takes ten pounds of fresh jalapenos to produce approximately one pound of chipotles. A pound of chipotles goes a long way, as a single pod is usually enough to flavor a dish.

First, wash all the pods and discard any that have insect damage, bruises, or are soft. Remove the stems from the pods before placing the peppers in a single layer on the grill rack. Start two small fires on each side of the grill with charcoal briquettes. Keep the fires small and never directly expose the pods to the fire so they won't dry unevenly or burn. The intention is to dry the pods slowly while flavoring them with smoke. Soak the wood in water before placing it on the coals so the wood will burn slower and create more smoke. The barbecue vents should be opened only partially to allow a small amount of air to enter the barbecue, thus preventing the fires from burning too fast and creating too much heat.

Check the pods and the fires hourly and move the pods around, always keeping them away from the fires. It may take up to forty-eight hours to dry the pods completely. The pods will be hard, light in weight, and brown in color when dried. If necessary, let the fires burn through the night. After the pods have dried, remove them from the grill and let them cool. To preserve their flavor, place them in a zip-lock bag. It is best to store them in a cool and dry location. If humidity is kept out of the bags, the chipotles will last for twelve to twenty-four months.

Along the East coast where I live there's always an abundant supply of fresh fish. In the Spring there's fresh mackerel, and the Bluefish in the Fall, are my favorites for smoking.

This recipe will work with Mackerel, Bluefish, Salmon, and even Cod.

If you catch the fish yourself, cut through their  throat to bleed them while they're still alive. Put them head down in a bucket so they'll pump out as much blood as possible. Wash and chill the whole fish until you can fillet them.

Mix brine until fully dissolved.  Early in the morning of the day you're going to smoke, wash 4 to 6 fillets and place them in the brine.

Mix this together in a glass or enamel bowl add the fish and submerge the fillets with a weight to hold them under the brine. Brine the fillets in the refrigerator from 2 to 4 hours (longer makes the fish saltier).

Remove the fillets and wipe dry with paper towels. Place them, skin side down, on several thicknesses of dry paper towels and let them air dry for several hours. The surface is dry enough when your finger sticks to the flesh.

Hot smoke over a 250F wood fire for about 2 hours or until the fillets are firm to the touch (like medium rare steak).

Peel off the skin and enjoy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          brown sugar
   1      cup           white sugar
   1      cup           sea salt

 A good friend and neighbor has one vertical smoker dedicated to fish alone.  I used to have one, but it got to smelling like fish so I sent it off to the dumps.  But, we have this great rub that was given (imparted, I don't know the word) to us by a gentleman that was 120 years old the last time I saw that Indian.

The story is, according to Old Bill, Mi Wuk Indian, take fresh (not frozen) fish and do the following:

Make a rub of:

2 Cups Brown sugar
1 Cup  White sugar
1 Cup  Sea salt

Crumble 3 or 4 or 5 good sized bay leaves and mince some garlic to taste.  About 6 good sized cloves for me.  But easier with garlic powder.

Mix the rub and apply a medium amount to both side of the fillets.  Set on racks and/or paper towels to get rid of the moisture during the night of curing.  Refrigerate if warm outside.

Next morning remove to racks or a table and let dry for an hour or two as the smoker is warming.  Smoke slow till just flaky.  Thin cuts an hour or better, thicker a couple hours or more, at least.

Scrape the meat carefully from the bones of neck, back, etc, of the goose, remove all tendons and tissues and chop very fine. Fill this in the skin of the neck and sew up with coarse thread on both ends. Season legs, breast, and filled neck with salt. Rub well with garlic, sugar, salt , and saltpeter. Place in a stone jar. Cover with a cloth and put weights on top--keep under brine which will form and must cover meat. Put aside for 7 days, turning occasionally. Take out of the brine, and cover with gauze and send to the butcher to smoke. When done, serve cold , sliced thin.

                          Smoked Habanero Salsa

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3                    habaneros, seeded and cut into strips -- up to 15 chilies
   5                    tomatoes -- skinned and seeded
   3                    onions -- cut into rings
   1      head          garlic peeled -- minced
     1/2  cup           Cilantro -- chopped
     1/4  cup           fresh basil -- chopped
     1/4  cup           fresh oregano -- chopped
   2                    limes -- juice of
                        olive oil
                        salt
                        sugar

Get a grill going with mesquite. Sauté the onions until they are soft and the rings separate. Then oil a vegetable grid or wok (the ones with all the holes in them so stuff doesn't fall through), and add the onions. Top this with the tomatoes. Let them grill for 3 or 4 minutes. Coat the garlic and habaneros with the olive oil and add to the grill and stir it up. Let this grill for about 2 or three minutes. Now coat the oregano, basil and cilantro with the olive oil and add to the grill another 2 to 4 minutes.

Remove everything from the grill and put it in a food processor along with the lime juice. Give it a whirl, add some salt and sugar to taste and make sure it's all mixed up well.

Depending on how hot you like it and how hot the peppers are that you have, there's no specific amount of peppers to use. Also, I leave the pepper seeds in. I don't care all that much for cilantro and cut the above amount in half.

This is a great salsa, quick to make and excellent flavor!! Those of you who shop with Mo-hotta-mo-betta might recognize this.

Hope you all try it.

                        ***SALAMI #1***
   5      pounds        hamburger
   5      teaspoons     curing salt***
   1 1/2  teaspoons     garlic powder
   1 1/2  teaspoons     onion powder
   2 1/2  tablespoons   pepper -- black, peppercorns

   4      tablespoons   wine -- white, dry

   2 1/2  tablespoons   chili powder
   1 1/4  teaspoons     cumin -- ground
   2      tablespoons   sugar -- brown
                        ***SALAMI #3***
   5      pounds        hamburger
   5      teaspoons     curing salt***
   3      tablespoons   wine -- dry, red
   1 1/4  teaspoons     garlic powder
   2 1/4  tablespoons   mustard seed -- whole
   1 1/2  tablespoons   basil -- ground
   1 1/2  tablespoons   oregano -- ground
     3/4  cup           Parmesan cheese
   2      tablespoons   sugar -- brown

Mix all ingredients thoroughly then cover and chill 24 hours or more.  Divide into 4 portions.  Roll portions into 2 1/3"-3" diameter rolls and wrap with inexpensive large hole nylon net.  Tie ends securely with string (net may be omitted, but rolls flatten out during smoking).

Smoke in smoker for 8-12 hours with the fuel of your choice.  This assumes a cold smoke.  Adjust times accordingly, but make sure salami is done throughout.

Remove from smoker- remove netting and dry thoroughly with paper towel.  Wrap in foil and refrigerate up to 3 weeks or freeze up to 6 months.  It is so easy to make you don't have to make large quantities and store.

*** Curing Salt (VERY IMPORTANT) Use only 'Tender Quick' or prepared curing salt.  Regular salt does not have the flavors, taste or nitrate added to the quick cure and will not bind the meat required to make these recipes successful.  You may purchase prepared curing salts sold by Mortons, Lowry's and other companies.  Check in your local supermarket near where they have the salt...  Other sources would be butcher shops, wine stores and feed stores.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   8      smoked        Idaho potatoes -- peeled
   6      cups          chicken broth
   4      tablespoons   butter
   1 1/2  teaspoons     salt
     1/2  cup           cream or half-and-half -- heated
                        black pepper -- to taste
                        white pepper -- to taste

To Smoke Potatoes:
The day before smoking (two days before serving) wash and air dry the potatoes.  If you wash them immediately before smoking, the skin pours will be closed and the smoke will not penetrate.

Next day, smoke the potatoes for 2 1/2 to 3 hours at 225F using hickory if possible.  Mesquite should be avoided.  After smoking, while potatoes are still hot, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  The potatoes also may be frozen, peel on, for later use.

On serving day, peel the outer layer of skin from each potato.  Peel only the outer skin, not down to the white because a thin layer of brown smoke discoloration should be left on the potato.  The smoked potatoes may be used for soups, chowders and stews.

Mashed Potatoes:
Halve the peeled potatoes lengthwise and cut into 1/2 inch slices.  Place potatoes and 4 cups chicken stock in a large covered saucepan over medium-high heat.  As soon as broth comes to a boil, lower heat and simmer gently until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Add additional broth if necessary.

Drain potatoes and transfer to a large bowl.  Mash the potatoes with butter, leaving some lumps for texture.  Stir in cream and season with salt and peppers to taste.

I like to hand rub the rib lightly in Shillings crushed garlic, if you don't want to mince you own, then rub with a mixture of equal parts of black pepper, paprika, red pepper, and salt. Easy on the salt, for I feel it can tend to pull out some of the moisture, but you got to have some for good flavor--add more salt after it is cooked, or let you guest do it. Smoke at about 225F(I just love that slow cooking), turn meat over after about half done--start out with fat side up. Take off between 150F for really pink, or up to 160 for just barely pink. If you are using cayenne pepper for red pepper, remember that cayenne is much hotter than red.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   8      Large         fire-roasted poblano chilies
   8                    smoked quail breasts -- diced in 1/4" pieces
   2      tablespoons   olive oil
   4                    shallots -- minced
   1      small clove   garlic -- minced
     1/2  ounce         tequila
          pinch         minced cilantro
   1      pound         goat cheese

To prepare stuffing:

Peel poblano chilies, split down one side and remove seeds. Sauté diced quail in olive oil, shallots and garlic until shallots are soft, taking care not to burn the garlic. Deglaze pan with tequila and set aside to cool. When mixture is cool, mix in cilantro and goat cheese.

Carefully stuff the peppers. You may sew the chilies up with strips of blanched leeks and a needle.

To bake chilies:

Preheat oven to 350F. Place stuffed chilies, cut side down, in a baking pan and cover. Roast for about 40 minutes. Uncover and roast another 5 minutes. Serve on a pool of Tomato-Cilantro salsa.

To roast chilies:

Using long tongs, place peppers over a gas flame and turn until the skin is evenly charred. You may also place the peppers on a cookie sheet and roast them under the broiler, taking care not to burn them. Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, seal and let them steam. When peppers have cooled, using rubber gloves, carefully peel skin and make an incision down one side of the chilies and remove seeds, making sure not to tear the chilies.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           sugar
   1      cup           brown sugar
     1/4  cup           salt
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
   1      quart         hot water
   1      quart         cold water
   3      pounds        fresh salmon

Mix the first five ingredients and then add cold water.

Put salmon in brine mixture and leave for 8 hrs in refrigerator.

Remove salmon, run water over to rinse off then towel dry. 
Put the salmon on a cooking rack at room temperature and allow a glaze to form on the outside of the fish--about 1hr. 
Put in smoker for 6 to 10 hrs. (cooking time may very due to the outside temperature. The hotter the weather the less cooking time needed.)

Use 3 to 4 loads of wood chips (apple, alder, cherry) or (1 to 2 if hickory.)

Little Chief smoker and it works fine. Enjoy.

>> I like the idea of smoking the sauce but I don't want any grease in the sauce.  I'm using an OK-Joe vertical smoker.  Would a second pan filled with sauce placed on the top rack interfere with the cooking process?  This sounds like a good way to make a weak form of liquid smoke.  That might be good in some recipes.>>

My dad did that for as long as I can remember.  Scott takes the idea one step farther, letting meat juice drip in.  With Scott's method, you'll probably want to refrigerate it so the fat will harden and be easy to remove.

What I do is make my sauce, but keep it a little on the thin side. I pour it into a Pyrex dish, and set it off to the side on the smoker for the last few hours.  You'll get a blackish film that forms on the surface.  Just stir that in every half your or so, until you get the flavor you want.  Much better than using liquid smoke.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      Pounds        smoked link sausage -- your favorite kind
   1      cup           onions -- finely chopped
   1      cup           green bell peppers -- finely chopped
   1      cup           celery -- finely chopped
     1/2  cup           all-purpose flour
     1/2  cup           vegetable oil
   1      teaspoon      garlic -- minced
   7      cups          chicken stock
   2      tablespoons   file powder
                        ***Seasoning Mix***
   1      Teaspoon      Salt
   1      Teaspoon      Hungarian paprika
   1      Teaspoon      white pepper
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
   1      teaspoon      onion powder
   1      teaspoon      cayenne pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      dry mustard
     1/2  teaspoon      black pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      ground cumin

This recipe is adapted from several different gumbo recipes. Gumbo is a kind of stew served over rice. It is thickened with either okra or file (fee-lay) powder (ground leaves of the sassafras tree).  In the past, okra gumbo was made in the summer and file gumbo was made in the winter. Okra was used to thicken the gumbo in the summer because that was the only time fresh okra was available. Of course, these days you can get just about anything anytime of the year. File powder was used in the winter when fresh okra was unavailable. If you can't abide the slimy texture of okra then you should probably omit the file. It doesn't really add any flavor but thickens the gumbo with a slimy consistency very similar to okra.

Smoke the sausage in the smoker for about 2 hours. I like to use cherry wood when smoking sausage. When cooled, slice into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices and set aside.

Put the chicken stock in a large pot and put on the stove to come to a boil while you are making the roux. Combine the chopped vegetables in a bowl.

Make the roux.  In a heavy pan, preferably cast iron, add the vegetable and heat over high flame. Add the flour and whisk constantly until the roux is a dark reddish-brown, almost black. Be careful not to let the roux burn. The best way is to lower the heat and whisk until the roux is the right shade. This may take 20 minutes or so. If the roux burns you should throw it out and start over. When the roux is the right color dump in the chopped vegetables and stir.
Add the seasoning mix. Cook, stirring frequently for about ten minutes. Spoon the roux mixture into the boiling stock. Add the sausage and minced garlic. Simmer over low heat for 45 minutes.

Turn off the heat and add the file powder. Serve over plain cooked rice with some French bread. You can sprinkle additional file powder over the serving if desired.

NOTES : I used fresh mushrooms (8 oz) and sautéed them along with the onion, squash and bell pepper and doubled the cheese to 2 cups, then 1/4'ed a tomato and arranged it on top before cooking. It sure looked good with the juices bubbling and the cheese and crust nice and browned when I took it out of the smoker. I cooked it closer to 1 hour than to 30 minutes. Big Jim

     1/3  cup           cider vinegar
   1      large         clove garlic -- minced
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/2  tablespoon    freshly ground black pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      sugar
     1/2                avocado -- peeled
     2/3  cup           olive oil
   3                    green onions, white and light green parts -- only
                         -- finely chopped
   1      small         white onion, sliced paper thin

   3      cups          spinach leaves -- well washed
   1      head          butter lettuce*
   1      pint          cherry tomatoes -- halved

* Remove and discard the outer leaves and tear the inner leaves into bite-sized pieces.

Prepare a smoker for hot smoking by soaking and then igniting 3 large hardwood chunks, and regulating the temperature so that it will remain between 240 and 250F.  Smoke the fish for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the flesh is flaky and cooked through.  Shred the flesh and refrigerate until ready to serve.

In a blender, combine the vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper, sugar, avocado, and olive oil and blend for 1 minute, until completely smooth and emulsified.  Transfer to a glass bowl, stir in the green onions, and taste for seasoning.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.

When ready to serve, drain the onion slices, pat them dry, and separate them into rings.  In a large mixing bowl, toss the spinach, lettuce, and tomatoes, together gently.  Pour on enough dressing to coat, and toss again just to mix.  Place a mound of the salad on each of 6 plates and scatter about 2 ounces of the shredded swordfish over the salad.  Drape a few onion rings over the top and serve.

                        ***Ginger Vinaigrette***
     1/3  cup           peeled/sliced ginger
     1/4  cup           fresh lemon juice
   2      tablespoons   white wine vinegar
   1      teaspoon      sugar
     2/3  cup           peanut oil
                        freshly ground pepper to taste
                        salt to taste
   2                    smoked trout
   1                    red onion -- sliced paper-thin
   2                    ripe but FIRM avocados
   6      cups          packed spinach
   2      large         navel oranges -- sectioned, remove
                         -- all membranes

Here's how to make the aforementioned vinaigrette:

Chuck the ginger in a blender or processor and do it up finely. Add the lemon juice (FRESH) and vinegar and grind to a puree (that's French for beating it to a pulp). Pour it into a bowl and whisk in the sugar, peanut oil, and salt/pepper. With me so far? C'mon Lloyd, get with the program... and Kurt, NO, you can't add tofu.

Now we're ready to start puttin' the thing together. Skin and bone the trout... this will be either very E-Z or an Excedrin headache, depending on how well you smoke the swimmer. Bottom line is that you want the trout in bite-sized pieces. When yer there, set them aside.

Go fetch another bowl (OK, we'll wait till ya clean it out... but make it snappy), and mix up the onions and just 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette. Let that stuff sit around for at least 15 minutes.

Now cut the avocados in half (save the pit and grow leaves - which are useless). Peel and cut into long slices, about 1/4" wide. Getcha another bowl (this is a bowl-intensive recipe), and drizzle 1/4 cup of vinaigrette all over.

Get another bowl (man, I wish I was in the business), and toss the greens with their vinaigrette and the onion slices with a 1/2 cup of the remaining vinaigrette. Dump that mixture on 4 salad plates, and place the orange segments (remember them?) and trout pieces in the same bowl and toss well. Try not to hit the ceiling. Then put the trout pieces and avocado and orange slices and place them appropriately upon the greens.

Simple enuf?

I can assure you, it's easier to make than to type. And it's absolutely delicious as a main course.

   2      pounds        smoked turkey -- chopped
   4      quarts        turkey stock
   2      pounds        carrots -- chopped
   3      ribs          celery -- chopped
   1      large         onion -- chopped
   1      large         jalapeno -- chopped
   3      cloves        elephant garlic -- chopped
   6      tablespoons   minced garlic
  56      ounces        canned tomatoes with liquid -- chopped
   2      pounds        frozen corn
   1      pound         frozen okra
   1      pound         frozen Crowder peas

   4      tablespoons   nuoc nam
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   dried sage -- crumbled

The secret to this soup is in the stock. Take the carcass from one large smoked turkey, add water to cover, throw in a couple of bay leaves and some whole black peppercorns. I also add the pan drippings from the turkey collected from the drip pan in the smoker, and the turkey "jelly" at the bottom of the Dutch oven from when I finish the bird off in my range. Bring the stock to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 3-4 hours, adding more water if necessary. Strain the stock, cool it overnight in the refrigerator, defat it, and cook it down some more until you have about 4 quarts of rich, concentrated stock.

At this point, add all other ingredients, bring to a boil, reduce heat to a high simmer, and cook, covered, for about 2 hours, or until carrots are soft and pliable. Remove from heat and serve. As with all soups, it is better the next day.

                        ***BRINE***
                        water to cover
     2/3  cup           kosher salt per gallon of water
   1 1/2  cups          black pepper
     1/2  cup           Texas Pete hot sauce
     1/2  cup           onion powder
     1/4  cup           garlic powder

Tuesday night:
Brine: set the turkey (completely covered in brine) in the fridge over night (about 7 hours).

Wed: Removed on Wed morning and rinsed well.  Covered with peanut oil and placed in fridge till I got home from work (uncovered).  After work (it was an early day, played 2 hours racquetball before coming home and was still home by 1230) I injected with butter, garlic powder, onion powder, hot sauce, and black pepper.  Don't know how much cause I just kept making it until I had injected every few inches.  Rubbed down with oil again, sprinkled with black pepper, some poultry seasoning, and garlic powder and returned to fridge.

Thurs.: (reminder, my wife had to work so we planned on eating late): Removed from fridge to allow to warm to room temp.  Started fire about 11a.  Injected one last time with same stuff as before.  Stuffed the body cavity with onion chopped into quarters, and half an onion in the neck cavity.  A friend had given me some blackberry wine that was to dry for me so I poured some into the body cavity and mixed with oil for the final rub down.  Sprinkled more pepper on it.  Rest of wine went into water bowl.  Quartered several more onions to be put into the fire pan with the oak, hickory, and blackjack oak.  Used heavy smoke and high heat for the first hour, then let the heat drop down to 275 and the smoke to light for the rest of the cooking time.  Bird went in at noon and off at 8p.  (21.45 lb.  bird) Done to perfection.  Wife and kids claimed best ever (been doin birds for 16 years, only been brining and oiling for the last year or so.  The oiling tip came from this list (thanks Danny).  In the past I just wrote the blackened skin off and peeled it off while carving.  The blackberry wine added a slight fruitiness to the overall taste.  I also placed some foil pans in the bottom rack to catch all the drippings.  Used this to make gravy and to add to my cornbread stuffing.  I was afraid that the juices would make the gravy to Smokey to eat, but it was just a strong hint, with no gravy left.  Kids loved it on the dressing and potatoes.  Most of one breast was eaten last night, the rest of that one will be gone today.  The other side will be sandwiches for the week.  The dark meat will become chili this weekend, or I may freeze it till some cold weekend.  Might use some to make some of the soups in this months On The Grill.  My first cheesecake turned out great!

                Smoked Turkey With Smoked Oyster Dressing

Recipe By     : Tom Solomon
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    8-12 pound turkey
   1      cup           white vinegar
   7      cups          water
                        FOR THE DRESSING:
   1      loaf          stale bread, pulled into chunks
   1      quart         oysters with liquid
   1      medium        onion -- finely chopped
   1      cup           celery -- finely chopped
   8      cloves        garlic -- pressed
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1                    jalapeno -- finely chopped
   3      sprigs        sage -- finely chopped
   1      teaspoon      dried oregano -- crumbled
                        black pepper to taste
   2      tablespoons   black mustard seed -- crushed
                        oil

This is a fairly straightforward smoked turkey recipe.

Prepare your smoker and smoke the turkey for six to eight hours between 220-240F, using your choice of hardwood (a 50/50 mix of apple and oak is excellent, if you can get it--try your best to include at least some fruit wood). If you live in a particularly dry climate, you can put a water pan underneath the turkey, or between the turkey and the heat source, to insure a moist smoke.

When you start the turkey, take your loaf of bread and spread it out on a table to let it get stale. About an hour before the turkey is ready to come off the smoker, take your quart jar of oysters, strain and reserve the oyster liquid, put the oysters into a pan, and put them in the smoker with the turkey. Keep up a good, steady smoke throughout the time the turkey is in the smoker.

At the end of six or eight hours, remove the turkey and the oysters from the smoker. Set the oysters aside, put the turkey into a large Dutch oven with a cover. Add one cup of white vinegar and about six or seven cups of water to the Dutch oven--enough liquid so that there is about one and a half to two inches in the bottom of the oven. If you'd like, you can sprinkle the turkey with a little garlic powder and black pepper and drizzle with honey, but this is optional. Put the turkey, covered, into your range oven and bake at 325F for 2 to 3 hours, or until the internal temperature of the bird at it's thickest point reads 190F (I like to be extra cautious when it comes to poultry. I lived in North Carolina, which is one of the top commercial turkey producing states in the USA, for a long time, and I've seen how they're raised).

While the turkey is baking, get out a large baking pan. Brush lightly with oil, pull your stale bread into chunks, and place in the pan. About 15 minutes before the turkey is done, add the chopped onion and celery, pressed garlic, chopped jalapeno, sage, oregano, black pepper, and crushed mustard seeds. Combine well. Add the smoked oysters and reserved oyster liquor (make sure you've strained this well). Combine. Remove the turkey from the oven and keep covered. Add 2 to 3 cups of the turkey liquor from the Dutch oven and 4 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce to your dressing and combine well. Don't make it too wet, but you do want it to be somewhat doughy. Place the dressing in your range oven and bake at 325F for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until the top of the dressing is just slightly darker than golden brown.  Remove the dressing from the oven and serve along with the turkey.

   1      35 pound      Virginia-cured country ham

As long as we are talking ULTIMATE, my vote goes for the Virginia cured country ham which I cooked last weekend. We had about 60 friends over for our annual Silver-Queen and steamed crab Fest. I selected a moldy thirty-five pound ham from the smokehouse, washed it and soaked it about 18 hrs. I started the fire in our masonry cooker about 10:00 Fri. night and put in the ham skin side up. The intention was to slow cook with apple and oak for 14 hrs to an internal temp of 160F as I had done with a cured shoulder last month, but I woke at 3:00 and the fire had gotten too hot. I had forgotten to activate the alarm on The Sunbeam thermometer in the firebox and the temp was over 400F. Luckily, the ham fat had not caught fire. After knocking down the fire with water, it cooked the rest of the night at about 275F so that the internal temp was up to 170F by 8:00 in the morning. I allowed it to cool slowly in the cooker so that at noon the internal temp was still 160F. 
We served the ham about 7 p.m. and it was fantastic. The size and ample covering of skin and fat had protected the meat from the excessive temperature.  It was crusty on the outside and moist (for cured ham) on the inside. It was pullable but firm enough to slice and though only seven months old had a good depth of aged flavor and just the right amount of smoke. After the pickers finished, we only had a few scraps left for ourselves.

                Fish And Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      whole         white sturgeon
   1 1/2  pounds        kiln dried medium salt

Preparation:  If you've got the whole fish, hang it up by the tail, dress it, remove the spines with a cleaver, put a bucket under the head and let it bleed for 2-3 days. Remove the head, take the fish to the cutting table, carefully cut a ring around the smallest circumference (just before the tail) and break the tail loose.  Pull on the tail, the spinal cord will emerge, keep pulling until it comes all the way out - this tubular membrane is very elastic and may require two or three pulls to get it. After it's out, pinch the cord between your thumb and index finger at the tail and squeeze forward to remove the clear marble-like nodules inside - they will pop out the open end. Cut the tail off, take the cord and hang it over a rafter in your garage or in the smokehouse to dry. When it's wet it will be about 6-8', dry about 4-5' and they make the best boot laces you can get. 
Filet the fish, trim the belly up to the rib cartilage and trim all of the cartilage away - leaving one long clean filet (sturgeon have no bones, only the rib cartilage and spinal cartilage). Cut the filet into pieces that can be handled. I use a wooden apple or peach box and cut the pieces about as long as the boxes. Lay the fish in the box or tray and salt it by hand, using enough salt to cover the entire surface. It should resemble something like new fallen snow - over the thickest part of the filet the salt will be white, on the thinner areas near the edges and towards the tail where less salt is used, the covering will be more clear or translucent.  Let sit in a cool place overnight (on average about 12-16 hours for 2" thick filet). The fish will slowly draw salt and the salt will draw some moisture from the fish. Wash the remaining salt off with cold water and firmly squeegee the surface moisture with your hand.  With a sharp knife, cut across the filet making 2" wide pieces and lay them skin down on the smoke rack, making sure that the pieces don't touch each other.

The smokehouse should be warm (80-90F) with good smoke when the racks are loaded.  Leave the doors cracked open for about 2-3 hours or until the surface is shiny and dry to the touch. Close the door/s and slowly bring the temp up to about 120-130F and keep it there for about 6-8 hours.  Bring the temp up slowly for the last time until it reaches 150F and hold for 2-3 hours. Remove the racks, let it cool to room temp. and peel the skin off.  If your like me, I'm munchin' down while it's still hot in the smokehouse. The smoking takes a full day - if you start at 7-8 in the morn you should have a pretty good snack just about bedtime. It will keep for quite a while in the fridge - couple of weeks- you could also freeze or can. I also use this method for smoked salmon and smoked tuna. Alder (IMHO) is best for fish, but cherry and other fruitwood work good too.

Wash birds inside and out. Put water in a large non- aluminum container, add salt and sugar and stir to dissolve. Add soy sauce, tarragon, thyme and pepper. Submerge birds in brine and weigh them down with a heavy plate so that they stay submerged. Refrigerate overnight.

Remove birds from brine and wash inside and out. Pat dry. Reserve brine. Start smoker, fill water pan with water and half of reserved brine. Place chickens, breast side up, on top rack of smoker. Cover and smoke at 200 to 250F for approximately four hours, until internal temperature of the thickest part of the thigh reaches 170F. Baste with olive oil after two hours.

   3      dozen         ears of corn -- shucked

                        salt

1.  Shuck fresh corn
2.  Brush with peanut oil
3.  Sprinkle with salt and cayenne
4.  Cook on the hot spot of grill until golden, turning as necessary

I use a Brinkmann's Pro. The thermometer on the smokin' side says 225F.  The infamous hot spot is hotter. Around 400F. I have filled the entire thing with corn (3 dozen ears) and just keep marching towards the hot spot as you pull off the cooked corn. They should be in a single layer so that they cook and are exposed to the smoke evenly. It takes about 25 minutes for the first ears to get done. Rotate the corn on the hot spot once half way through so it doesn't burn. The rest go faster as they have been pre-warmed.

Throw a handful of this into your regular salsa and your lips be smackin' double time.

                        ***See Directions***      

The Meat: Generally, the lean scraps from most venison (elk, deer, caribou, antelope and moose) work very good. Bear is greasy(sorry Bear), as is pork. Buffalo is similar to beef and makes good jerky. The best cut of beef that will yield the most usable lean meat is the top round. If you like turkey, use large bone in breasts and remove the bone. I haven't done reptiles, but what the hey, if that's your bag give it a shot.

The meat should be reasonably aged, at least kept cool for a week or so after it's dressed out and skinned. It is important to trim as much fat off as possible, even if you have to cut it out or scrape it off. The fat will not take salt very well when the meat brines, it will become rancid and grow mold quickly. Cut the meat with the grain, into strips as big around as your thumb ( 3/4-1" square) and as long as possible.

The Brine: This is a self brining method and works in two stages, dehydration and rehydration. The ingredients needed are: A kiln dried medium salt. Most feed stores have 50# bags for about $3. which will make about eight thousand pounds of jerky. Medium salt is about the size of salt that comes on a pretzel. Molasses. I use Brer Rabbit light or Grandma's. Brer Rabbit comes in pint bottles and have a small top that you can pour a nice 'string' from. Grandma's comes in a large mouth bottle and it's best if you transfer it to some sort of a squeeze top ketchup or pancake syrup bottle (1 pint = about 20# of meat).

Black Pepper, medium grind or coarse - your choice. If you like it hot, use red pepper flakes instead, if you don't like pepper leave it out. This brine process goes easier and more quickly if you have a few extra happy hands joining in - the kids, the wife and myself usually make it a project and when it's done everyone gets to pat each other on the back. Since we're all together and helping each other, some interesting conversations usually surface. Anyway, you will need a flat bottom non-corrosive container /s and lid, a Tupperware storage bin, a plastic bus tray or a stainless steam table pan will work well. The size depends on the amount of meat and the room in your refer - the lids keep things out and are handy for stacking the containers.

Salt the bottom of the pan evenly, making sure to get in the corners as well. This may not be as easy as it sounds. Put a few pounds of salt in a bowl, cup your fingers together and scoop out about a half a handful - not in your palm. Shake your hand back and forth across the top and about a foot above the top of the pan. As the salt starts to leave your hand, slowly open your fingers and let the salt run through evenly. Hand salting may require some practice. Practice salting the bottom of the pan until it becomes comfortable and the coverage is without gobs or streaks or voids. If this method becomes too frustrating, a shaker top jar works too - a mayonnaise jar with the metal lid poked full of holes by a 16 penny nail. The coverage amount should be between light coverage (barely covering) and full coverage (completely covering) - the only comparison I can think of, is sugar on a pie crust, or, sugar on your cereal. You don't want it too salty, so, one might consider their first batch of jerky experimental and take it from there.

String the molasses. Same kinda deal as the salt, hold the bottle about a foot above the pan, start moving it from side to side and pour. When the molasses starts running try to get a 'string' about the size of a pencil lead and let it crisscross the pan bottom over the salt. Once the strings are even in one direction, change directions (perpendicular) and string evenly across again. Don't forget the corners. When it's done it will be an even grid about 1/2" square covering the pan bottom. Good luck... don't worry, 10-12 layers and you'll be able to sign your name with it. The pepper will vary as to individual taste. 
One note though, pepper almost doubles its intensity as it soaks and is easy to overpower the finished product. I would recommend that a light dusting would be sufficient for most people (about the way you would pepper a baked potato). Red pepper flakes, even more so. Again, hold the pepper can about a foot above, and dust it evenly - good, you remembered the corners. Layer the meat strips across the bottom of the pan one at a time. Starting on one side, place the strips next to each other without overlapping and with all of the strips running in the same direction. Work the meat across until the layer is complete, without voids. Pat the surface, edges and corners down smooth and flat. Salt, molasses and pepper the surface as was done to the bottom of the pan to start. The second layer of meat is done the same, but it is ran perpendicular to the first layer. Pat smooth, salt, molasses and pepper. Each additional layer is ran perpendicular to the layer before it. Continue layering the meat until it reaches to a level about 2" from the top of the pan. The last layer, or partial layer, gets the salt, molasses and pepper treatment as well.

This brining method will cure the meat in two days. Place the pan/s in the refer, cover and let sit undisturbed for the first day (refrigeration is not necessary if prepared in a cool climate 35-45F). After about 24 hours the meat should be 'turned' - Dig your hands in the pan and separate all of the strips, turning it over several times to get the meat redistributed into a random order. Mash the meat back down into the brining juices ( at this point the juice will be thin and watery) cover and let sit for another day. I usually taste the juice at this point - if it tastes too salty it can be rinsed with water, but it will not be as good. If the salt is right it will have a slightly sweet, peppery flavor. During this next day the meat will soak up the brine juices and when the meat is removed before smoking, it will have a 'candied' texture - sticky and pliable. There should be very little, if any, brine solution left in the pan. The meat will have soaked up the brine and be somewhat swelled up, as compared to the first turning.

Smokehousing the meat: The smoking process will require a smokehouse or smoking unit that is capable of maintaining 80-90F. If there is a small volume, piping the smoke from an external source will provide a cooler smoke, and a hot plate or a few briquettes/lump charcoal could provide the heat source. In a medium size unit (refrigerator size), a cast iron frying pan with chips set on a hot plate will work - although it may be difficult to maintain a constant temperature. The more volume, the easier it is to control the temperature. I would recommend that a fire be built and maintained throughout the smoking process, which will take from 48 to 70 hours - depending upon the thickness of the meat. The smokehouse that I use is medium - large (350) cu. ft., it will maintain a good smoky 80-100F with 2-3 half gallon milk jug sized pieces of wood burning. Use seasoned, barkless wood - your choice, I use red alder, apple, plum, cherry, oak, pear and some of the best I've ever done was with some 75 year old grape stumps. Citrus works good too.

Get the smokehouse going and rack or hang the meat while the temp becomes stabilized. If you rack the meat, place it *without* the pieces touching each other - just enough room to run a finger between the strips. Stainless 3/16" rod sharpened on both ends works good for hanging - again, leave some space between the strips. As you place the strips, run them through your thumb and index finger to squeegee off any excess brine. Before placing the racks or skewers into the smokehouse, coarse black pepper or additional red pepper flakes may be added - for those who like lotsa zip. Load the smokehouse and leave the door cracked open for the first couple hours, or until the surface of the meat has dried to the touch. Close the doors, poke the fire and keep an eye on the temps for a couple of days. Don't worry about the meat spoiling if the fire goes out. The meat is cured. It's said that the old timers used to make their jerky while they traveled. When they made camp at night they would hang the jerky over the campfire until dawn, when they broke camp they simply packed up the jerky and continued smoking the next night.

This process takes about 4-5 days and is worth every minute. Probably the two most important items would be too much salt and too much heat. If you decide to try this method, I garr-own-tee you'll never find another piece of store bought jerky that even comes close.

First, cut the fish lengthwise into 2 halves for curing purposes. Leave the skin on. Find a dish that's long enough to lay the halves in flat. Once that is done, you can pour the marinade over the fish. Cure the fish in this marinade for about 2 hours in the refrigerator. Put it into your smoker with a mild wood (I used cherry wood and alder) for about 5 hours. The temperature in the cooking chamber doesn't need to be as hot as for a brisket or butt, maybe 180-200F. Take it out, let it cool, refrigerate and eat it the next day with crackers, cheese, and wine.

Smoking Cheese from the, Home book of Smoking Meat, Fish and Game by Jack Sleight & Raymond Hull

Almost any cheese may be given a gentle smoking to enhance its flavor.

From a short exposure to very heavy smoke, cheese may pick up a slightly sooty flavor, so a light smoke and a somewhat longer application is desirable.  Two hours of light smoke is a fair average.  Low temperature-especially with softer cheeses-is essential.  The  oven should not get above 80F.  Below 75F will be better.

To give maximum absorption of smoke, the cheese should preferably be in fairly thin slabs-not thicker than 1 1/2 inches.  Any rind, peel, wax coating should be removed before smoking begins.
The cheese will necessarily lose some weight, will shrink a little, and
become somewhat firmer in texture during smoking.  This is merely the result if partial dehydration, and does not indicate any loss of nutriment.

After smoking, cheese should be wrapped again as it was before, and kept under refrigeration.  However, it will not yield its finest flavor if it is eaten cold.  Remove from refrigerator an hour or two before it is required, and give it time to warm up to room temperature.

After smoking the cheese remains fresh and free from any sign of mold or decay much longer than a similar unsmoked cheese, even kept at room temperature.

'Smoke and Spice' and Chris Schlesinger's books cover smoking vegetables.  Most vegetables can be smoked with tremendous results.  Use temps of 200-220F.  The time depends on the size of the pieces.  Here are some general guidelines gleaned from Smoke and Spice.  They should be rubbed with oil or Italian dressing before cooking so that they don't dry out of stick to the grill.  Most vegetables can also be grilled directly at higher temps but this is a different flavor than smoking.

Whole sweet or whole potatoes- prick with fork, rub with oil smoke 2 hours.

Quartered potatoes-rub with oil and season, 40 minutes.

Large onions- Cut in half, wrap in foil and cook 30 minutes- open foil flat, season, and continue smoking for 40 minutes.

Sliced onions- rub with oil and smoke 40 minutes.

Artichokes- trim tips, soak in olive oil and lemon juice for 1 hour- smoke 1 1/2 hours- steam over boiling water 30 minutes.

Corn- husk on- peel back husk to remove silk- soak in water for 2 hours- rub with oil and reposition the husk- smoke for 1 hour.  - husk off- blanch in boiling water for two minutes- rub with oil- smoke for 30 minutes until golden brown.

Eggplant- slice 1/2" thick- lightly salt and allow to drain in colander for several hours- rub with oil, season, smoke 40 minutes.

Peppers- bell and chilies- rub with oil and smoke 40 minutes.

Mushrooms- especially portabellas- marinate in oil based dressing for 1 hour-smoke for 20 minutes- this can take the place of burgers.

Squash- cut in half, do not remove seeds, rub cut surfaces with oil, smoke cut side down for 2 hours.

Zucchini- rub with oil and smoke 1 hour.

Tomatoes- cut in half, rub with oil, smoke 20 minutes.

   5      pounds        beef shoulder roast
   1      large         onion -- chopped
   6      cloves        garlic -- chopped
   1      tablespoon    ground cumin

   3      tablespoons   Wyler's granulated chicken broth
   8      cups          beef broth
   1      cup           strong black coffee
   2      squares       Goya brand semi-sweet Mexican chocolate
     1/4  cup           masa harina
                        ***For the beef broth***
   3      pounds        beef bones
   2      stalks        celery
   2                    carrots -- unpeeled
   2      medium        onions -- unpeeled cut in 1/2
   2      cloves        garlic -- whole, unpeeled
   5                    bay leaves

This is the chili I made for my friend Wat Hughe's 1998 bi-annual chili party. This is a Texas style red chili. Texas chili has no tomatoes but more importantly NO BEANS! Some of the ingredients I used, like the chocolate and the Wyler's granulated chicken broth (in lieu of salt) are non-traditional but I like the flavor it adds. I pretty much winged it during the preparation but kept track of what I did so I could write it down. I think this batch turned out pretty darn good.

Rub the beef roast down good with a BBQ spice rub. I used Texas Two Step BBQ Rub For Beef available from Texas Two Step Foods, P.O. Box 1328, Tomball, TX 77377. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day smoke the beef roast for 3 hours at 225F over pecan wood chunks.

Meanwhile, brown the beef bones in a large stock pot. Fill the pot with water and add celery, carrots, onion, garlic and bay leaves. Simmer on very low heat for 10 hours. Strain the broth removing the bones and vegetables.

Dice the beef roast into 1/2" cubes. Brown in a large cast iron Dutch oven chili pot. Add a little vegetable oil if necessary. Brown the beef in small batches covering the bottom of the pot in a single layer. After the last batch is browned, remove from the pot and add the chopped onion and garlic. Stir until the onions are soft and lightly brown. Return the beef to the pot. Add the chili powder, ground red chile, paprika, cumin, and oregano. Add 8 cups of beef broth and bring to a simmer. Add the chocolate, granulated chicken broth, and coffee. Simmer uncovered for 10 hours on the lowest possible heat. Add more beef broth if the level boils down.

Mix the 1/4 cup of masa harina with 3/4 cup of water. Stir into the chili and simmer until thickened.

Chili is best when it has had some time to age, at least a week is good. Serve in a bowl with a hot, fresh flour tortilla.

   2      tablespoons   butter -- soft
   1      tablespoon    flour or
   1      tablespoon    grated parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
   1 1/2  cups          corn kernels, fresh (3 ears of corn) or
   1 1/2  cups          frozen corn, defrosted
   1 1/2  cups          yellow cornmeal
     2/3  cup           milk
     1/4  cup           olive oil
   1      tablespoon    olive oil
   1 1/2  cups          Munster cheese -- freshly grated
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/2  cup           onions -- coarsely chopped
   3                    egg whites
   3                    egg yolks

Preheat the oven to 400F. With a pastry brush coat the bottom and sides of an 8 1/2 or 9 inch square shallow baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the soft butter, then scatter 1 tablespoon of flour or grated parmesan over the bottom of the dish. Tip the dish from side to side to spread the flour or cheese evenly on the buttered surfaces and set the dish aside.

Place the corn in a food processor and puree at high speed. (To puree the corn by hand, force it through a food mill set over a bowl. Discard any pulp left in the mill.) In a large bowl, combine the pureed corn, cornmeal, milk, 1/4 cup olive oil, grated Munster cheese and salt, and mix thoroughly. NOTE -- if a spicy effect is desired, add Cayenne pepper to taste.

In a heavy 8 to 10 inch skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil over moderate heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 or 5 minutes, or until they are soft and transparent but not brown. With a rubber spatula, scrape the onions into the corn and cornmeal mixture. Beat the egg whites with a whisk or a rotary or electric beater until they are firm enough to form unwavering peaks on the beater when it is lifted out of the bowl. Beat the egg yolks in a separate bowl until they are thick and lemon colored, then fold them into the egg whites. Gently but thoroughly fold the combined eggs into the corn mixture, then pour it into the prepared baking dish. Dot the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon of soft butter. Bake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes.

     1/2  tablespoon    shortening
   5      tablespoons   milk
                        oil for frying

Sift flour with salt, baking powder and sugar. Cut in shortening. Add milk to make a firm dough. Cover bowl and let dough stand for 45 to 60 minutes. Roll dough about 1/4th inch thick on lightly floured board. Cut into rounds.

Heat oil in electric skillet to 375F. Fry only a few pieces at a time, turning once so they will puff up very easily. Drain on paper towel and keep warm in oven until all are cooked. Serve with honey and sprinkle with cinnamon. The classic way to eat sopapillas is to make a slit and pour honey into the cavity. For very puffy sopapillas roll dough very thin, and fry in very hot oil.

                        ***FOR THE ENCHILADAS***
   3      cups          turkey (up to 4 cups) -- cooked, diced
   1      dozen         flour tortillas
   1 1/2  cups          Monterrey Jack cheese -- grated
   1      can           cream chicken soup
   1      can           cream mushroom soup
                        sour cream
   1      can           Hertez red or green sauce -- (4 oz)
                        OR Pace picante
                        OR green chilies
   1      dash          salt garlic or garlic salt
                        minced onion
                        chopped black olives if desired

Combine the soups and add about 1 cup sour cream in a medium saucepan.  Warm until well-blended.  Add Hertez, chilies, or other hot sauce, garlic, salt.

Spoon about 2 tbsp. of the turkey into a flour tortilla along with a spoonful of sauce.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and a 'dollop' of more sour cream (optional, I don't do), roll up and place in a casserole dish seam side down.  Continue until all the tortillas have been rolled.  Spoon the rest of the sauce over the top of the rolled enchiladas, be sure to moisten ends to keep them soft.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top, add the minced onion and chopped olives for garnish (also optional, also something I've never done).

Bake 325F for about 30 minutes, until the flour tortillas are soft, the cheese is melted, and everything is 'bubbly hot'.

NOTES : The Carolina story gets even more complicated when you consider South Carolina. There, as in Georgia, yellow barbecue sauce, made with lots of commercial mustard, is often the sauce of choice. We're not too crazy about the flavor of French's mustard, but the following medium-thick, yellow, authentic sauce does add delicious layers of flavors to the mustardy core. We find it especially delicious with something quite un-barbecue-like grilled shrimp.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           cornmeal
   1      teaspoon      baking powder
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      sugar
   1      cup           flour
   1                    egg
     3/4  cup           milk
   1      dash          red pepper
                        chopped green onion tops
   1      tablespoon    onion -- grated

Sift dry ingredients into bowl.  Beat egg, add milk, and add this to cornmeal mixture.  Add onion and red pepper.  Drop by spoonful in hot deep fat (375F) and fry until brown.  This makes approximately two dozen.

" While there is a great deal of speculation as to the origin of hush puppies, there should be no speculation on the tastiness of these." Quoted from Mrs. Robert Bowlus.

NOTES : This is a recipe that we have made for decades, and is from the " River Road Recipes" published by the Junior League of Baton Rouge, La. 1963. The key to this recipe, and these hush puppies is the GREEN ONION TOPS...the way they have, and always  will be made in South Louisiana.

Defrost the roast if frozen. Sprinkle on rub. Rewrap and put in refrigerator for several hours (preferably overnight). When ready to smoke, take out of refrigerator, sprinkle on more rub, and let it sit for an hour.

Get smoker ready and up to 200F. Smoke (I use hickory or mesquite) for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours per pound. Take off, let rest for fifteen minutes, slice, and eat up. Best venison roast I ever had.

   1      cup           leftover beef -- cut in small cubes

   1                    or 2 onions cut fine
   1                    green pepper cut fine

Brown beef and onions together in 2 tablespoons of butter. Add 2 cups boiling water and the potatoes and green pepper. Salt and pepper to taste. Cover and let cook slowly until all ingredients are tender. The hash should have plenty of gravy, and more hot water may be needed. A small amount of flour thickening may be added when done. Serve on toast or preferably soft grits.

I think you could use some pork in this and would be OK.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        lean pork or lamb cubes
                        cane skewers
                        salt
                        pepper
                        lemon
                        oregano
                        FOR METHOD TWO:
                        lemon juice
                        olive oil
                        crushed garlic
                        fresh tomato wedges
                        onion slices
                        Tzatziki recipe
                        dry white wine
                        fresh pita bread

Method 1:  (Quick and easy) Thread the meat lengthwise on 8" round or   flat cane (bamboo) skewers. Grill over hot coals or griddle until   thoroughly cooked, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and dip quickly   into lemon juice.  Crush oregano over the meat.

Method 2:  (Takes longer, tastes better) Make up a marinade of lemon juice and good quality olive oil, oregano and/or thyme, pepper, crushed garlic and maybe a little dry white wine.  Marinate the meat overnight, then grill until just cooked, not dry. Eat as is, straight from the skewers, or remove meat and serve in pita bread pockets, with tomato wedges, onion slices, and Tzatziki, with salt and additional freshly ground black pepper.

-----

We use flat pita, kind of like a tortilla.  Brush with olive oil and grill on both sides until warm.  I like mine crisp so I grill a little longer. Place the meat, onion, tomato and tzatziki on the pita and  fold it over.

Don't know if you've got this type of pita where you are.

   1      teaspoon      fresh ground pepper
   1      cup           water

I blended the marinade well in the food processor and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours for the flavors to blend. I took half of the marinade and strained it and injected it into the two hams, about 1 1/2 cups in each one.

Then I rubbed the hams with the Souvlakia Rub.

     1/2  cup           olive oil

   2      teaspoons     salt
   2      teaspoons     oregano
   1      teaspoon      fresh ground pepper

I let them sit overnight in the refrigerator and then took them out to come to room temperature. I cooked them in the smoker at 250F, using seasoned maple for fuel. I started mopping with the remainder of the marinade after 4 hours in the smoker, mopping about every hour. Took them out after 12 hours, wrapped them in foil and let them sit for 2 hours in a dry cooler.

They really turned out well. The injected marinade kept them moist and they were falling apart tender. Great flavor! The maple smoke blended quite well with the souvlakia marinade flavor.

After the first 30 minutes, remove the foil. Using a flat spatula, cut slice the meat loaf all the way through into 8 pieces while still in the pan. This will help to cook the center of the meat loaf.

Pour the following mix over the loaf: 1/2 tsp. sugar with 3 T ketchup and 1 T Barbeque sauce. Don't spread the sauce. Place back into the oven and cook uncovered for 30 to 40 minutes or until done.

NOTES : I found this recipe for pickled peaches in a book published in
MCMLXXXVII, when ever that was.  (I think that it's 1987, but I'm not sure.
I couldn't buy a vowel!)  It's called "Quick & Delicious Canning, Pickling,
and Preserving, by Johna Blinn, a syndicated food columnist.

   1      teaspoon      lemon pepper
   1      teaspoon      ground red pepper

The lighter side of the story is this: I stumbled across a simple recipe for a steak seasoning that I've found to be quite good.  There's nothing particularly tricky about it but it makes a dang good T-bone or ribeye whilst we wait for the clouds to clear.

In the above proportions, mix.

Brush lightly with olive oil, sprinkle on and press in spices on both sides then let steaks sit for 1 hour before grilling.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***RUB***
     1/4  cup           paprika
     1/4  cup           ground chile pepper blend -- see note
   2      tablespoons   coarse salt
   4      teaspoons     sugar
   4      large         bone-in rib eye steaks -- see pantry
                        ***RED CHILE ONION RINGS***
   3      medium        onions -- cut in 1/4" slices
                        milk
   1      cup           flour
     1/4  cup           paprika
     1/4  cup           ground chile pepper blend -- see note
     1/4  cup           cumin
                        coarse salt
                        cayenne pepper
                        vegetable oil -- for deep frying

GROUND CHILE PEPPER BLEND -- dried red chile peppers, medium-hot; such as a mixture of guajillo and pasilla and chipotle

STEAKS: Four 1 to 1 3/4-pound bone-in rib eye steaks, 1 to 1+1/4 inches thick, at least choice grade and preferably prime grade to serve 4 or more.

At least 2 1/2 hours and up to 12 hours before you plan to grill steaks, prepare dry rub, combining ingredients in a small bowl. Coat steaks thickly with mixture. Wrap steaks in plastic and refrigerate.

About an hour before you plan to grill steaks, get the onion rings ready for frying. Place onion rings in a large bowl and cover with milk. In a paper or plastic sack, combine flour, paprika, dried chilies, cumin and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Pour at least 4 inches of oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pan.

Remove steaks from refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

Fire up grill for a two-level fire capable of cooking first on high heat (1 to 2 seconds with the hand test) and then on medium heat (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test).

Grill steaks uncovered over high heat for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side. Move steaks to medium heat, turning them again, and continue grilling for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare doneness. The steaks should be turned a minimum of three times, more often if juice begins to form on the surface. If grilling covered, sear both sides of the meat first on high heat uncovered for 2 1/2 to 4 minutes; finish cooking with the cover on over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes, turning the steaks once midway.

Meanwhile, heat oil for the onion rings to 375F. Drain onions and dredge them in the seasoned flour. Fry onions, in batches for 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp. Serve them immediately, piled high on the hot Pyles's steaks.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2  pounds        jalapeno -- about 75, sm. to med
   6      cups          white wine vinegar -- at least 5% acidity
   6      cups          water
   2      teaspoons     salt
  10      ounces        pearl onion
   1      head          cauliflower florets -- small head
   1      pound         baby carrots -- peeled
  27      sprigs        fresh oregano -- marjoram or
                         -- rosemary
  18      cloves        garlic -- peeled
  18                    dried red chilies
  18                    bay leaves
   3      tablespoons   dried pink peppercorns

In a dry skillet, over medium-high heat, sear the jalapenos, turning them often, until the skins are partially blackened, blistered and split, about 7 minutes.  Don't overcook or allow them to soften.  Remove from skillet and cool.

In a non-reactive pan, combine the vinegar, water, and salt.  Set over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover, and keep the brine hot.

Pack the prepared jars tightly with the jalapenos, onions, cauliflower, carrots, oregano, garlic, dried chilies, and bay leaves, leaving 1/2 inch headspace.  Add 1 teaspoon pink peppercorns to each jar.

Pour the vinegar mixture into the jars, covering the contents of each completely and leaving 1/2 inch headspace.

Process for 15 minutes in boiling water bath.  Store at least 6 weeks before using.

                Jerky

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        beef brisket or venison
   1      large         fresh white onion or 1/3 cup onion powder
   1      large         fresh garlic or 2 tbs.. garlic powder
   1      bottle        liquid smoke (4 fl.  oz.)
   1      cup           soy sauce
     3/4  cup           Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   steak sauce "A.1."
   1      tablespoon    MSG
   2      teaspoons     seasoned salt
     1/3  cup           black pepper -- ground
   1      tablespoon    fresh rosemary leaves
   2      tablespoons   sugar
                        ***THE HOT STUFF***
   5      whole         fresh Habanero chilies (more to taste) -- with seeds
   1      tablespoon    dried Pequin chili pepper -- with seeds
     1/2  bottle        hot sauce "Melinda's XXXtra" (5 fl. oz.)
   4      tablespoons   dried Cayenne pepper -- ground

Prepare meat by cutting into strips 3/4" X 1/2" and as long as you prefer.  Cut across grain for tender and lengthwise for chewy.  The more consistent  you are when cutting the strips the better your jerky will dry evenly.

Mix all ingredients in blender except meat and Cayenne.

Soak strips of meat in the above mixture and refrigerate for 24-48 hours in a close container (I use a Tuppleware¨ bread box).  Shake several times to mix well.  Pat dry.  Place directly on oven racks that have been covered with tin foil and sprayed with Pam.  Cook in pre heated oven at 160F for 2-3 hours (with door closed).  This kills bacteria,  removes a lot of the excess moisture and melts any excess fat.

Return hot strips to mixture and refrigerate for another 6-12 hours (remember to shake several times).  Pat dry and sprinkle with Cayenne powder.  Spread in dehydrator.  Set dehydrator at 145F.  The final drying usually takes about another 6-10 hours.  Do not over dry (Check every few hours).  Jerky should be tuff and leathery,  not brittle or hard.  A real mouth watering HOT treat!  Enjoy.

If you don't have a dehydrator return Jerky to 150F oven for  6-12 hours leaving door open a little.

An alternate for the final drying would be to use a low heat smoker.  Leave out the Liquid Smoke in the Marinate.

Note - Venison has always cooked faster for me than beef (less moisture?).  So check it more frequently.

Yields about 1.75 - 2 lbs. dried jerky.

NOTES : I make this nice and hot for a reason.  If I leave out most of the hot ingredients my children eat it like candy (2 lbs. in 3 days!).  Experiment with the heat factor to your taste.

   1                    poached strawberries
   1      quart         strawberries, a little under-ripe,
                         -- hulled, left whole
   2      cups          water
   1      cup           sugar
   1      tablespoon    lemon juice
   1      tablespoon    kirsch
                        ***SUGARED PECANS***
   2      cups          pecan halves
   1                    egg white
   1      cup           sugar

Bring water, sugar, and strawberries to a simmer and allow to cool. Then add lemon juice and kirsch. Drain most of liquid (reserve and boil down; it makes a great syrup for future use) and pour poached strawberries into prebaked pie crust.

Preheat oven to 325F. Toss pecan halves with egg white until completely coated. Stir in sugar. Bake stirring mixture every 5 minutes until coating is a nutty brown, 25-30 minutes. Immediately transfer to cool pan in single layer to cool before using. Use to top pie.

Check out Cook's Illustrated May/June 1993 for a great treatise on poaching fruit.

For the pie, use whatever prebaked pie crust you like and fill with poached strawberries. Top with sugared pecans. We always make more than one quart of berries, so I'm not sure how many berries you'll need to fill your crust. Leftover berries served in a reduction of the syrup are also great.

   1      cup           shredded sharp cheddar cheese

MICKEY TURNER'S

Let me tell ya folks.  When I was a little kid growing up down in the Cotton Mill section of Denison, Texas, my mamma always had a worthless patch of dirt she called a garden.  Seems like nothin would grow in that spot but peppers, so my brother and I learned real quick that peppers was one of the basic food groups all by themselves and out of shear ignorance and believing everything our mamma told us we grew to liking the little critters just about anyway you fixed um .  Well, about forty years later the old Cotton Mill is long gone and so is mamma s garden, but my appetite for peppers isn't.  Now, I've worked with a little lady by the name of Mickey Turner for God knows how long, and let me tell ya , her stuffed peppers put old mamma s to shame.  Why, she ain't no bigger than the peppers she stuffs, but size is made up by taste.  These are the best I've ever had in all my forty-six years on the planet, Texas.  Try um and if they ain't no good, then you must have done somthin' wrong!!

Batter: Mix all dry ingredients in a very, very large bowl.  Then blend the egg yolks with the buttermilk and stir into dry ingredients until pancake batter consistency is reached.  Beat the egg-whites and fold into the batter.

MICKEY TURNER'S STUFFING: Sauté the onion in a little butter until done, then fry up the ground beef and sausage together with the onion until brown, then pour into colander and drain, but don t let the meat get too dry.  Mix in the shredded cheeses.  Now you re ready to start stuffin them peppers.  Drain the peppers from the can, then wash them real good.  Cut each pepper open and remove the seeds.  Stuff the little puppies! When you get them all stuffed, set in freezer for about an hour.  This will help stuffing stick together when you place it in the batter.  After they have set in the freezer about an hour start dipping them in the batter, and fry in deep fryer at about 350F.  When each one is golden brown, remove and place on paper towel.

   1      pound         fresh jalapenos
   1      pound         cream cheese
   1      tablespoon    chopped sun-dried tomatoes*
   1      tablespoon    chopped cilantro

                        peanut oil for frying

* the kind packed in oil
** beaten into a cup of water

Slice Jalapenos in half (length wise) and remove/reserve all seeds Combine cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and cilantro, add a few seeds if you want a hotter stuffing.

Stuff each 1/2 of the Jalapeno with the cream cheese mix, shaping it so the Jalapeno looks whole.  Place each stuffed jalapeno on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper.  When you've stuffed all the jalapenos put them (still on the sheet) in the freezer for at least 30 minuets.

Remove from freezer, dip in egg wash and roll in cornmeal till completely covered.  You may at this point re-freeze, and when frozen place in freezer bags or Tupperware and keep for a month.

Keep frozen until ready to serve.

Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a frying pan (ensure at least 1" of oil), I'm not sure of the temp, probably 375-400F.  Fry the frozen jalapenos for about 1min (till the cornmeal turns a good golden color) and serve hot..  The cheese, since it was frozen, will have remelted, but won't be blistering hot.

   1      teaspoon      dill seed -- bruised
   1 1/2  pounds        salmon fillet

At least 2, and up to 6, hours before you plan to smoke the fish, combine ingredients in a bowl.  Place salmon in plastic bag or shallow dish and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (This conflicts with the 2-6 hours mentioned above. I marinate for 3 to 4 hours.)  Remove salmon from refrigerator and let sit 30 minutes at room temperature.  Drain fish but leave any spices clinging to filet.  Transfer fish to smoker, skin side down, and drizzle marinade generously over fish.  Smoke 45 to 55 minutes at 225-250F.  <I've found that the fish is done in 20 to 30 minutes.>

NOTES : This is a cure that I've been using a lot lately.  It's not hot, but provides a lot of flavor.  There's not much salt in it, and I don't think it is intended as a preservative.  When I finish smoking the salmon, I flake it onto a salad of mixed greens with sliced cucumbers and fresh dill that has been tossed with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

This is a hot, spicy sauce for meats, poultry, or fish, or add it to soups, like you would add Tabasco sauce.

Place all the ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth.  Simmer over a low heat for 20 minutes, stirring constantly.

Yield: a little bit goes a long way.

Heat Scale: Extremely Hot

                Slaw

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4  cup           vinegar
   6      tablespoons   water
     3/4  cup           sugar
   6      tablespoons   oil
   1      pound         shredded cabbage
                        or packaged coleslaw mix
                        pepper
   2 1/2  teaspoons     celery seed
     1/4  cup           minced onion
                        diced pimento or sweet red bell pepper -- optional
   1      tablespoon    salt

Combine dry ingredients, except the cabbage, then mix in the water, followed by the vinegar, and finally the oil. Place in a sealed container and refrigerate overnight. A few hours before serving, pour dressing over the cabbage, mix well, and refrigerate until serving.

Notes - This coleslaw, even more than most, will cause a pronounced love/hate reaction. For that reason, I usually prepare just a single batch because, although I love it, I can only eat so much. I would rather run out, than have to bring some home. Also, I'm serious about the "covered container". Even if you REALLY love this slaw, when you refrigerate it uncovered, things like cheese and hard-boiled eggs will start to taste very funky the next day!

          Sweet and Spicy Barbecued Ribs With Green Chili Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      racks         Pork Spareribs -- 3 and Down
                        ***For The Rub***
   2      tablespoons   cumin, ground
   2      tablespoons   coriander, round
     1/4  cup           paprika
     1/4  cup           garlic, minced
     1/4  cup           cilantro, fresh -- chopped fine
     1/4  cup           brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   Kosher salt
   2      tablespoons   black pepper -- freshly ground
                        ***For The Green Chili Sauce***
   3      tablespoons   olive oil
   2      medium        yellow onions -- peeled, minced
   2      tablespoons   garlic, minced
   1      16 oz can     tomatillos -- drained
   4                    Anaheim or Poblano Chile Peppers -- Diced
     1/4  cup           lime juice, freshly squeezed
     1/2  cup           cilantro, fresh -- coarsely chopped

In a small bowl, combine rub ingredients; mix well. Coat the ribs thoroughly with the rub; place them on baking sheets and roast in 200F oven for 3 1/2 hours. Don't turn them-all you are doing now is slow cooking and infusing them with spices. 
While the ribs are cooking, make the sauce. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat until hot, but not smoking. Add the onions and sauté, stirring occasionally until transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté, stirring occasionally for 1 minute. Add the tomatillos, chilies and lime juice; simmer for about 5 minutes. If you are using fresh tomatillos, you want them to be just starting to break down. Remove the sauce from the heat; puree in a food processor or blender, a bit at a time until smooth. Stir in the cilantro and set aside. If you want to serve it warm, return it to the saucepan. Just before serving, reheat over low heat. 
Remove the ribs from the oven. They can stand out for a while and then be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, or they can go right onto the grill. (If you do refrigerate them, bring them to room temperature before the final grilling.) 
When you're ready to put them on the grill, put them over a low fire and leave them there for 7 to 10 minutes, turning once or twice. Since they are already cooked through at this point, what you are looking for is some color and a good sear. When they have achieved this, remove them from the grill and serve them accompanied by the sauce.

Editor's Note:  I personally would cook the ribs in a smoker at 245F instead of an oven at 200F for 4-5 hours.  Not only will the ribs take on a good Smokey flavor, but you'll also be able to skip having to grill them.

     1/4  cup           pineapple juice
   2      tablespoons   soy sauce
   2      tablespoons   brown sugar
   1      teaspoon      Kentucky bourbon

     1/2  cup           vegetable oil
   2      8-ounce       salmon fillets
   2      teaspoons     snipped fresh chives.

Combine the pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, bourbon, pepper and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the oil.

Be sure all of the skin is removed from the salmon. Place the fillets in a shallow dish and pour the bourbon marinade over them, saving a little to brush on the fish as it cooks. Put a lid over the fish and refrigerate for at least an hour. A few hours is even better.

Preheat your barbecue or stovetop grill over medium/high heat. Cook the fish for 5 to 7 minutes per side or until each fillet is cooked all the way through. Regularly brush the fillets with the marinade. Arrange the fillets on each plate with the chives sprinkled over the top.

Blanch corn in boiling salted water for 2 minutes and drain.

Place the corn around the edges of a HOT FIRE, where the heat is lower, so it is just barely over the coals. Cook the corn, rolling it around frequently, for about 3 minutes, or until well browned. Remove from the grill.

As soon as the ears are cool enough to handle, slice the kernels from the cobs into a small bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and toss well.

   1      pound         sugar
   1      ounce         saltpeter
   6      cloves        garlic -- crushed
   4      ounces        pickling spices -- optional

The sweet pickle cure is used for large and small cuts of meat.  For shoulders and hams the pickle is often injected around the bones with a special syringe that pumps the fluid through a hollow needle.  The curing may then be completed by immersion in brine, or by application of a dry cure.

The salinometer reading should be about 60F. The quantity of pickling spices may be increased if a spicier flavor is desired. And some other notes: Prepare the spices by boiling them slowly in half a pint of water. Keep the meat completely submerged in this solution for a time depending on the size of the pieces--from 10 days if the pieces weigh about 2 to 4 lbs. each, up to 16 days if they weigh 7 to 8 lbs. 
Overhaul every third day.

Inspect daily. 
If the pickle is kept at 35F there should be little risk of deterioration. But if the brine begins to change color noticeably, and to smell sour, pour it away at once, wash the meat in clean water, wash out the crock and sterilize it with boiling water.  Then make a fresh batch of brine.

Many tough cuts of meat can be made tender and palatable by curing--for example, the brisket from which corned beef is made. Bear, elk, venison, moose, etc. that is too tough to cook by ordinary methods can be turned into a real delicacy by sweet pickle curing.

"This recipe appeared in the Toronto Star many years ago as a result of a contest to create a sauce similar to Swiss Chalet's barbecue sauce.  Home economist Kay Spicer created the winning recipe."

Anne's note: Swiss Chalet is a chain of Canadian chicken restaurants.  This sauce is brushed on the chicken before cooking and served at the table in small containers to dip the chicken pieces in.

Pour cups of water and tomato juice into 1 1/2 qt saucepan.  Add bouillon cube, paprika, sugar, salt, basil, parsley, poultry seasoning, thyme, ginger, mustard, onion powder, bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco.  Stir well or whisk to mix.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.  Stir in lemon juice.

Mix cornstarch and 1 Tbs. water to smooth paste.  Add to mixture and cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes until sauce thickens.  Whisk in oil.

                        diced red-ripe tomato -- garnish

At least 1 hour and up to 4 hours before you plan to grill swordfish steaks, prepare dry rub, combining ingredients in a small bowl. Rub steaks with mixture, wrap them in plastic and refrigerate.

For the vinaigrette: Combining ingredients in a food processor.

Remove steaks from refrigerator and let sit covered at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

Fire up grill, bringing the temperature to medium-high (3 seconds with the hand test).

Transfer steaks to a well-oiled grate and grill uncovered over medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side, until opaque throughout. Rotate fish 180F once on each side. If there is any resistance when you turn or rotate fish, re-oil the grate. If grilling 1 covered, cook for the same amount of time, turning and rotating in a similar manner.

Serve steaks hot, drizzled with vinaigrette,

This recipe comes from observation and many trials of a menu item from a small, shopping center BBQ joint located near Texas Instruments in Austin, Tx.  The owner of the joint called it T-man because the first ones he made were for his 'regulars', just to clean up the bits and pieces leftover from a frantic lunch crowd.  The T was for trash-man. Word of mouth about how good the concoction was caused him to make it a full fledged menu item.  Hope ya'll like it as much as I do.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      head          garlic
   1      tablespoon    olive oil
     2/3  cup           water
   1      cup           pineapple juice
     1/4  cup           Kikkoman teriyaki sauce
   1      tablespoon    soy sauce
   1 1/3  cups          dark brown sugar
   3      tablespoons   lemon juice
   3      tablespoons   minced white onion
   1      tablespoon    Jack Daniel's Whiskey
   1      tablespoon    crushed pineapple
     1/4  teaspoon      cayenne pepper

1. Cut about 1/2-inch off of top of garlic. Cut the roots so that the garlic will sit flat. Remove the papery skin from the garlic, but leave enough so that the cloves stay together. Put garlic into a small casserole dish or baking pan, drizzle olive oil over it, and cover with a lid or foil. Bake in a preheated 325F oven for 1 hour. Remove garlic and let it cool until you can handle it.

2. Combine water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a medium saucepan over medium/high heat. Stir occasionally until mixture boils then reduce heat until mixture is just simmering.

3. Add remaining ingredients to pan and stir. Squeeze the sides of the head of garlic until the pasty roasted garlic is squeezed out. Measure 2 teaspoons into the saucepan and whisk to combine.

4. Let mixture simmer for 35-45 minutes or until sauce has reduced by about 1/2 and is thick and syrupy. Make sure it doesn't boil over.

Makes 1 cup of glaze.

NOTES : Here's a recipe that you won't find in any books. The producers of the Oprah Winfrey Show asked me to crack this one just for the show that airs sometime in June.   Introduced in April of 1997Introduced in April of 1997, this glaze has become one of Friday's best-selling new items. This versatile sweet-and-slightly-spicy sauce can be ordered on salmon, baby back ribs, steak, chicken, pork chops...even on chicken wings.  This recipe tells you how to make a clone that tastes virtually identical to the original glaze that you can use it to top your favorite meat, but if you're grilling, be sure to use the sauce just before taking the meat off the flame, since it is very sweet and will quickly burn. Serve extra on the side.

     1/2  cup           peppers (sweet and hot mixed) -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   Kitchen Bouquet

Cook 2 hours, (stir often, because it will burn on the bottom) pour in hot jars, seal.  Really good.

Now, that is the "basic" recipe.  As everyone on this list knows, you can play with this recipe.  I always add more peppers, but usually less onion.  And I usually always add more oregano and cumin.  Just add to your taste.  Also, stir constantly, or it will burn on the bottom. Also, this is one of those recipes, sometimes, I cook it really thick and other times, my  tomatoes are so juicy, that I get tired of standing in the kitchen, and it just gets put up thinner.

In a bowl combine corn meal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pepper, and onion.  Stir in buttermilk or beer and eggs until well mixed. Hushpuppies customarily are fried in drippings from fried fish. You need 1/2 inch hot fish drippings or oil.  Drop batter into hot oil by tablespoons and cook until browned and puffed.  Turn and brown the other side.  Remove from fat and drain on paper towels.  Continue cooking until batter is used. 
Serve hot with fried fish, barbecue, or vegetables.

Put the chicken in the marinade and rub the marinade into the slashes with your finger. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, turning 4 or 5 times. About 1 1/2 hours before serving, light charcoal. Peel onion for garnishing and slice paper-thin. Separate rings into ice water and chill.

Grill chicken 7 or 8 minutes on each side, then raise the grill and cook another 15 to 20 minutes on each side. Baste with marinade as you cook. Warm a large platter. Place chicken pieces on platter - drain onion rings and lay on top. Quarter lemons lengthwise and place them around chicken - the chicken is good with extra lemon juice squeezed on. Serving Size 8

                            Tandoori Spice Rub

Recipe By     : Bruce Bjorkman
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      teaspoon      ginger
   1      teaspoon      cumin
   1      teaspoon      coriander
   1      teaspoon      paprika
   1      teaspoon      turmeric
   1      teaspoon      salt
   1      teaspoon      cayenne

The tandoori is an oven used in East India for Cooking.  This rub will give chicken or fish the authentic flavor of food straight out of Bombay.  It works well at high temperatures, so you can use it for either grilling or barbequing.

Place all ingredients in a resealable plastic bag, close, and shake to mix thoroughly.

Go to the Barbecue/Grill section.  She has many great recipes for low- fat smoking and grilling as well as other food types.

In a food processor, puree the onion and garlic.  Process in the lemon and lime juice, add spices and the yogurt and process to blend.  Marinate the chicken breasts in this mixture turning occasionally overnight in the refrigerator.  Prepare a charcoal or wood fire and let it burn down to embers.  Remove the excess marinade and grill for 5 minutes on each side or until done.  Serve with Yogurt Cilantro sauce to taste.

   1      teaspoon      hot sauce

Brown meat in a skillet, and then put it in a good sized pot. Simmer with onions and garlic and chicken broth for 1.5 hours covered. Don't open the lid!

Add the tomato sauce, chili powder, and cumin (and anything else you've decided to throw in). Stir.

Put the cover back on, and simmer for another 15-60 minutes (timing is not crucial). But take the lid off 15 minutes before serving so the aroma fills the kitchen!

Serve with crusty bread. Or no bread. Chili's one of those things that refuses to be destroyed.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      10 pound      boneless pork butt
   5      tablespoons   salt
   5      tablespoons   cayenne pepper
   3      tablespoons   freshly ground black pepper
   3      tablespoons   white pepper
   2      tablespoons   paprika
   2      tablespoons   cinnamon
   2      tablespoons   garlic powder

Trim the pork of all excess fat and cut it into strips about 1 inch thick and at least 4 inches long. Mix together the seasonings and place in a shallow pan. Roll each strip of pork in the seasoning mixture and place on a tray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least overnight (preferable a couple of days).

Prepare your smoker. Place the pork strips on a grill or rod and smoke until done, 5-7 hours. Don't let the smoker get too hot.  Remove the meat and let it cool completely, then wrap well in plastic and foil. The tasso will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 10 days, and it also freezes very well.

Recipe By     :

Categories    : Bbq List                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      teaspoon      black peppercorns
   5      tablespoons   brown sugar
   1      teaspoon      green peppercorns
     1/3  cup           long-grain rice
   3      tablespoons   dry sherry
   1                    strip tangerine peel
   3      cloves        garlic -- peeled, minced
   3      tablespoons   soy sauce
   1      tablespoon    grated orange peel
   1      tablespoon    granulated sugar
   1      tablespoon    grated lemon peel
  10                    thin slices pared fresh ginger
   3                    green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces
   2      teaspoons     kosher salt
   1      whole         broiler/fryer chicken -- (3-4 Lbs.)
     1/2  cup           black tea leaves

For Marinade, crush the peppercorns.  Use a mortar and pestle or use a household hammer with peppercorns between a paper towel.  Combine the peppercorns, sherry, soy sauce, granulated sugar, ginger, garlic, onion pieces and salt.

Rub chicken inside and out with marinade.  Cover and refrigerate a minimum of 8 hours--best overnight.  Place chicken breast side up on a rack in a large stock pot.  Pour in 2 inches water.  Cover, bring to a boil, and steam until meat near the thigh is no longer pink, about 50 to 60 minutes.  Let stand until cooled enough to handle.  Lift chicken from rack and drain juices from cavity.

Line a large wok and it's lid with foil.  ( Do not use a electric wok with non stick finish).  For smoking place tea leaves, brown sugar, rice, and tangerine, orange, lemon peel in bottom of foil lined wok.  Mix well.  Set rack on top of mixture in wok.  Place Chicken breast side up on rack.  Cover with foil lined lid.  Cook over high heat for 2 1/2 -3 minutes.  Turn off heat and leave covered 7 minutes.  Repeat 3 more times.  After final smoking, let stand, covered to allow smoke to subside, about 30-45 minutes.   Do not uncover during this period, this is very important for two reasons, first the smoke is heavy and is needed to penetrate the bird, second is this smoke will set off your smoke alarm in your house.  Discard smoking mixture.

Slice chicken from the bones and arrange on serving plate.  You may top with a store prepared Chinese plum sauce.  Enjoy this smoked treat.  This is one of my families favorite dishes, I make this all the time when my wife's family is in town.  This past Christmas I even smoked a 19# turkey with this same method.  Of course I had to alter the recipe to accommodate this bird and used a large roasting pan instead of a wok.  Turned out great.  Use your own imagination on what to smoke next.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2                    1 lbs. salmon fillet -- (skin on),, boneless
                        ***CURING INGREDIENTS***
   4      tablespoons   black peppercorns
     1/2  cup           firmly packed dark brown sugar
     1/2  cup           coarse kosher-style salt
   1      cup           fresh cilantro leaves -- loosely packed
     1/2  cup           fresh dill weed
     1/2  cup           fresh chives
     1/2  cup           good-quality golden tequila
                        ***GARNISH***
   1      cup           fresh cilantro leaves -- loosely packed
                        sliced pumpernickel bread
                        spicy mustard
                        lime wedges

SPECIAL Equipment: Culinary-grade cheesecloth to wrap the fillets Heavy objects to weigh down the salmon as it cures, such as a bag of sugar or flour, bags of dried beans, or a jug of cooking oil.  Put the peppercorns in a small plastic bag and crush, using the bottom of a heavy skillet.  Add the sugar and salt to the hag and blend well together.  Place 1 cup cilantro and the dill and chives together in the howl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade and chop fine.  Lay a clean, washed, approximately 16-inch-square single layer of cheesecloth on a clean work surface.  Place the fish fillets skin-side down on the cheesecloth.  Spread the pepper/sugar/salt mixture evenly over the salmon.  Spread the chopped herbs in the same manner and then sprinkle the tequila over the herbs. 
Once all the tequila has been absorbed, sandwich the two fillets together, flesh to flesh and skin sides out.  Position the fillet "sandwich" in the center of the cloth and wrap as you would a gift, pulling the cloth as tightly as possible around the fillets.  Lay the package on a cake cooling rack set in a pan.  The rack allows air to circulate for more efficient drying, while the pan will catch the liquid expelled during the 3-day curing period.  Put the weight in a second, smaller cake pan and place it on top of the fillets to press out the unwanted water. 
Place the entire contraption in the bottom of your refrigerator.  Turn every 24 hours, replacing the weight each time.  At the end of the 3 days, remove the cloth, discard any accumulated liquid, scrape off the herbs, rinse with water, and pat the fish dry.  To serve, finely chop one cup of fresh cilantro and cover the flesh side of the fish.  Using a very sharp knife, slice the salmon as thinly as possible, at a 45-degree angle.  Your first slices may look a bit rough, but be patient.  With a little practice you'll soon he turning out elegant green-edged red ribbons of gravalax.  Serve on pumpernickel with spicy mustard and wedges of lime.  * *

NOTES : Rather than using smoke or heat, this traditional Scandinavian technique uses salt, sugar, alcohol, time, and a pressing weight to produce a silky, moist-textured cured fish that is as versatile and appealing as smoked salmon.  In this New World rendition -- one of the most popular appetizers served at '21' -- tequila replaces aquavit, and cilantro and chives join the traditional dill flavoring.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      8 to 10 oz.   New York strip steaks, trimmed -- 1 - 1-1/2 inch thick
     1/2  cup           tequila

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2  cups          soy sauce
   1 1/2  cups          Worcestershire sauce
     3/4  cup           pineapple juice
     3/4  cup           red wine vinegar
     3/4  cup           ketchup
     1/4  cup           honey
   4      teaspoons     garlic powder
   5      teaspoons     onion powder
   4      teaspoons     liquid smoke
                         -- (omit if using smoke
   1      tablespoon    black pepper
   1 1/2  tablespoons   salt
   4      teaspoons     ground ginger
  10      pounds        choice beef -- sliced 1/8"-1/4"
                         -- thick.

Mix everything except beef in a large bowl. Divide the marinade into two good-sized bowls. Trim all the fat, and most, if not all, of the gristle from the beef. When you get the end of the roast they couldn't slice, you can either slice it yourself, or just trim it up and use it as stew meat. If you like, throw the trimmings into a 2-3 qt. saucepan, cover with water, add a little onion, celery, carrots, garlic, etc., fresh or dried, if desired, and cook it up for stock. When you get about half of the meat trimmed, stir it into one of the bowls. By the time you get the rest of the beef done and stirred into the second bowl, the first bowl will be ready to go into the dehydrator (you can marinade the meat longer if desired, but then you half to find space in the refrigerator for it!). Drain the meat well and arrange on the dehydrator trays (it will take 10-12 trays to dry all of the meat, depending on thickness). Dry, following your dehydrator's instructions. If you don't have enough trays, don't worry. Just let the rest of the meat soak longer. If you have a 'fire-eater' in your family, this is where you can add a few dashes of Tabasco, cayenne, or whatever you consider to be YOUR favorite ignition source to this batch of jerky!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        FOR THE BEANS:
   1      pound         white navy beans
   1      small         red bell pepper -- diced
   1      small         green bell pepper -- diced
   1      medium        Spanish onion -- diced
   2      tablespoons   olive oil
   7      cups          chicken stock
   2      cloves        garlic
   3      teaspoons     cumin
   3      teaspoons     chile powder
   3                    plum tomatoes -- chopped
                        salt and pepper
                        FOR THE CHICKEN:
   3      whole         bone-in chicken breasts
   2      tablespoons   olive oil
   1      teaspoon      chili powder
   1      teaspoon      cumin
   1      tablespoon    garlic -- diced
   2      tablespoons   fresh cilantro -- chopped

BEANS
Soak overnight in water to cover.  Drain.  Over low heat, stir peppers and onion in olive oil for one minute.  Add beans and sauté over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add stock, garlic, cumin and chili powder.  Simmer, uncovered until beans are soft, about 1 1/2 hour adding more broth as necessary.  Stir in tomatoes about 20 minutes before beans are done and season to taste with salt and pepper.

CHICKEN
Crack the breast bones to flatten.  Rub breasts with oil and season with remaining ingredients.  Then roast in a preheated 350f oven about 30 minutes being sure not to overcook.  Cool slightly and remove meat from bones. (If  boneless breasts are used, grilling is preferable since they would dry out quickly if roasted).

Serving
Place a generous portion of beans in large flat soup bowl. Slice chicken thinly, keeping skin on and place on top of the beans.  Garnish with salsa, sour cream, cilantro, and a warm quesadilla. Make quesadillas by topping a soft flour tortilla with about 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese, 2 tablespoons sour cream, and hot peppers to taste. Fold each into quarters and warm through in a 350F oven.

   5      pounds        potatoes
   4                    or 5 onions
   1 1/2  cups          ketchup
   1      can           chipotles in adobo sauce, run through blen
                        (or use 1/3 cup Texas Pete hot sauce)
     1/3  cup           sugar
     1/4  cup           bacon drippings
   1      tablespoon    salt and pepper

This can be started as early as an hour or so after you get the shoulder on the cooker or at least an hour+ before serving time. (I think I liked them even better as leftovers the next day)

Peel the potatoes, then cut them and the onions into large chunks. Cover with water in a large pot and add everything else. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat and cook until the potatoes are soft. Leave them on a warm burner till dinner time. Add water if necessary to keep them covered.

Place the chicken halves, skin-side up, in a shallow baking dish.  Allow the chicken to stand covered in refrigerator for 24 hours.  Place the chicken halves, skin-side up, 4-5 inches from mesquite coals.  Cover and grill for 20 minutes, turn and grill at 20 to 30 minutes intervals.  Total cooking time is about 1 1/2 hours.

Just finished an awesome Rib-eye feast I'd like to share. Start by setting a fresh Rib-eye out on a platter. Sprinkle with fresh garlic salt, lots of cracked pepper, a little real balsamic vinegar (gourmet shops), and lightly rub with Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire. Top off with a little fresh parsley and some diced shallots. Squeeze some juice from a real lemon onto the steak.

Tenderize it with one of those stainless steel, 52 blade, spring-loaded, meat tenderizers a few times. 
Let it set 20 minutes while starting a fire on the grill. When the hardwood coals just start to turn gray, you are ready to start cooking. Grill about 5 minutes each side, placing the top cover on the grill. You can even pour the leftover juice, from the plate, on top while grilling. Try cooking some fresh Bratwurst next to it, while steaming fresh picked carrots, radishes, new potatoes, and broccoli in an electric steamer, and top the vegetables with handmade
Hollandaise sauce. 
Getting hungry yet. Don't bother looking for any BBQ or steak sauces to finish with. You won't need them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  pound         shredded Jack cheese
     1/2  pound         shredded cheddar cheese
     1/2  pound         hot sausage
   1 1/2  cups          Bisquick
   1                    egg -- beaten
   1      package       Spicy Shake N Bake
  20                    jalapenos

The peppers can be fresh or canned, just be sure you drain well if canned. You can also use the round mild cherry peppers instead. Slice the peppers in half lengthwise down one side only and scrape out the seeds. If you accidentally cut all the way through, just try to keep the two halves together. 
Mix Bisquick, sausage and cheddar in a large bowl. (Use your hands, and work those muscles!) Get your assembly line ready: the peppers, the shredded jack cheese, the sausage mixture, the beaten egg in a shallow bowl, the Shake N Bake in a shallow bowl, and a baking rack on a cookie sheet, both coated with cooking spray.  Stuff each pepper with shredded jack, then stick the halves back together, if separated. 
Grab a handful of the sausage goo and wrap around the pepper in the shape of an elongated egg. Dip in beaten egg and roll in Shake N Bake to coat evenly. Place on baking rack. When the peppers are all ready, bake at 350F for 25 minutes or till crisp. 
NOTES: You can put the peppers straight on the baking sheet instead of on a rack, but they wind up flat on one side. Hey, they still taste just as good, though. Also, don't be stingy with the sausage mixture. Be sure you cover the entire pepper, or cheese could explode out the side while baking. And, a final thought: I've heard it said that you can stuff the peppers with cream cheese instead of shredded jack. I tried that ONCE, and all I can say is that it takes more manual dexterity and WAY more patience than I have. And I really didn't think the results were worth it. But whatever way you decide to go, good luck. I tried cream cheese in both fresh and canned peppers and had good results, in fact the cream cheese didn't melt and run out like the jack cheese did.  Which reminds me -- after about 10 minutes in the oven the cheese  begins to melt and run.  When that happens remove the rack from the oven and turn the "leakers"  up so that the cheese doesn't all run out, then return the rack to the oven for the duration of the cooking time.

   1                    beef brisket, 8 to 12 pounds, trimmed
   2      cups          Mansion Barbecue spice mix
   1                    recipe beer mop sauce

Have your butcher trim the brisket with a thick layer of fat on one side, it's called a packer-trimmed brisket.  The day before you want to serve the dish, pat the Mansion Barbecue Spice Mix liberally all over the brisket.  Place the meat in a plastic trash bag and refrigerate it, preferably overnight. 
The next morning, remove the brisket from the refrigerator.  Either pre-heat the oven or the barbecue pit to 210F.  Place the brisket on a rack in a roasting pan or directly into the pit on the opposite side of the firebox making sure the trim side is up., to ensure basting juices.  Maintain the temperature of the oven or barbecue pit between 180 and 220F until the brisket is well done, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound.  Baste with the beer mop sauce every hour or so. 
When the meat is done remove it from the oven/barbecue pit and let it sit for 20 minutes.  Then cut the fatty top section away from the leaner bottom portion.  Trim the excess fat from both pieces and slice against the grain.  Serve with barbecue sauce on the side.

Cover; continue cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, skim fat from pan drippings; reserve 1 cup drippings.  Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion; cook until tender crisp.  Add reserved pan drippings, remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, the catsup, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce; simmer 15 minutes.

Carve brisket into thin slices across the grain; serve with sauce.  Garnish with fresh peppers and lemon and lime slices.

Note: For a smokier flavor, soak oak, pecan, mesquite or hickory chips in water 30 minutes and add to very low coals.

ROAST BEEF AL PASTOR

From: The Only Texas Cookbook, Texas Monthly Press, 1981 By: Linda West Eckhardt

John Casey has spent a lot of time in South Texas and has watched the Mexican cowboys cook over an open fire.  Here is the way he says to make a perfect al pastor roast beef.  First of all go to the best butcher you know and buy a good quality roast beef, a rump roast, that weighs between 6 and 8 pounds.

Next, you go to the hardware store.  Get a steel rod 4-5 feet long and 1/2 inch in diameter.  Have one end of the rod sharpened so you can drive it into the ground.  Drill 4 holes 6 inches apart at 2 feet, 2 1/2 feet, 3 feet, and so on.  Each hole must accommodate a good-sized cotter pin, which is inserted through the hole at right angles to the rod.  Thread a big flat washer onto the rod and let it rest on the cotter pin.  These pins and washers keep the meat from sliding down the rod.  The various holes allow you to adjust the distance between the meat and heat source, as necessary. Salt and pepper the roast, then impale the meat on the rod. Fix the washers below and above the meat, drive the rod into the ground at a 60 degree angle, and you have an alfresco spit.

Now here is the way Casey says to build the perfect outdoor fire.  Get the kids to find 2 logs that are well seasoned but not rotten.  They should be about 3 feet long and at least 4 to 6 inches in diameter. Butt these logs into a right angle.  Build a hardwood fire-oak, hickory, or pecan-in the crotch or the joint of the logs.  Keep the meat on the rod which is hanging out over this fire about 3 feet above the heat.  Turn the meat from time to time, Casey says the fire will smolder in the logs and that if you have everything positioned just so, you can go away at dawn and by 2 o'clock in the afternoon have a good dinner waiting.

BAKED BEEF HEAD

From: The Only Texas Cookbook, Texas Monthly Press, 1981 By: Linda West Eckhardt

John Casey tells me the South Texas ranchers had some help from Mexicans when it came time to butcher.  The Mexicans taught them how to make use of all the animal.  They would take a steer or heifer head, skin it, salt and pepper it, wrap it in several sacks of wet burlap.  Dig a deep hole.  Line the hole with rocks made hot by a roaring camp fire.  Put the head in. Cover it with a thin layer of dirt.  Then pour on more hot rocks and dirt until the whole thing was covered.  They would come back 18 or 20 hours later, dig the head up, unwind the burlap, pull out the tongue, hit the skull with an ax, and eat the brains, the tongue, everything.  Casey says its a real treat.

This meat-in-a-hole method is an old trick.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  They were having a huge barbecue in the Panhandle recently-one of those public celebrations where they killed 7 or 8 animals and meant to barbecue them all.  Well, you can imagine how this story went.  The Caterpillars were driven in to dig a huge pit.  The barbecue man laid his fire, got it just right, put in all this meat, covered it up.  Came back in 24 hours with 20,000 hungry people behind him, dug it up, and discovered the fire had gone out.  He had lots of beans, lots of cole slaw, and lots of rotting meat in a hole.  No wonder some cooks turn to drink.

MALCOLM DESHIELDS' BARBECUED BRISKET

From: The Only Texas Cookbook, Texas Monthly Press, 1981 By: Linda West Eckhardt

Malcolm DeShields is a wiry little chap from Corpus Christi who calls himself the Barbecue Man.  He is the sort of fellow who calls women under fifty "girl" and those over fifty "lady." He makes his points by giving you a jab to the shoulder for emphasis.  Malcolm belongs to the school that says wet sauces are bad for barbecue.  He says, and I agree, that any sauce with tomato or sugar will burn.  Barbecue cooked dry - over a very low heat and in a covered barbecue pit - will produce a marvelous real Texas barbecue.

This is what Malcolm says about cooking a brisket:

Choose about a 9-pound brisket. One with some fat on it. You don't want it too lean. Make you up a dry rub of equal parts of salt, fine pepper, and paprika - say about 1/8 cup of each - and rub this all over the meat real good.  Don't ever pierce it with a fork.  Turn it with them tongs.

Build you up a good fire in your barbecue pit-at one end using mesquite, hickory, or oak.  If you have to you can use hickory chips soaked in water with charcoal.  Now let your fire burn down real good.  If you have a pan of water to put in - all the better.  You'll have to figure out how to get it in dependin' on your own pit, but the water should be somewhere kinder in the middle.  Your fire cain't be too hot.  But you cain't let it go out either.  You may have to kinder nurse it along, addin' little logs from time to time, 'bout as big around as yore wrist.  Remember to keep the fire off from the meat.

Well, anyway, when you got your fire just so, put the brisket on and cover it up.  You'll need some sort of draw so the smoke just sucks right over the meat.  I'd say a 9-pound brisket 'ud cook about 18 hours. Now, girl, don't think you can just go off and forget it, you got to turn it once in awhile with them tongs, add wood or add water, but um-um, that barbecue will be just right.

You can do the same thing with pork ribs, steak, or chicken.

Use the same seasoning.  Cook ribs about 3 hours, chicken about 2. Steak just 20 minutes.

   1      teaspoon      Louisiana Hot Sauce
     2/3  cup           Worcestershire sauce
     1/3  cup           apple cider vinegar
   2 2/3  cups          beef stock
     1/3  cup           cooking oil

Combine all ingredients and use to mop meats that are barbecuing.  You can go to the dime store and buy a dish mop or you can rig one up at home by using a long-handled wooden spoon and some clean rags which you tie to the end of the spoon with string.  I always use the rag version, then simply throw the rags away.  It seems easier to me than keeping the mop clean between barbecues.  Leftover sauce will keep well in the refrigerator.  You will notice that as you stick the mop in the sauce the color darkens and becomes more chocolate brown because meat juices are blending with the sauce.  This enhances the flavor of the sauce and will make it better the
second time you use it.  You can use this mop for beef, pork, or chicken with equally good results.

As you can see, this sauce has no tomato and no sugar.  Any so called barbecue sauce with tomato or sugar should be served on the side and not rubbed on cooking meat because sugar or tomato will burn and char the meat surface.  Read labels on commercial products and apply the same rule.

WESLEY'S RIBS - Wes Gulley

From: "The Only Texas Cookbook", Texas Monthly Press, 1981 By: Linda West Eckhardt

Everybody wants Wes to bring his ribs to a barbecue.  He even knocks off from work early to give them enough time to cook.

After building a cool fire in his oil-drum pit, with a baffle over the coals, Wes puts on a side of pork ribs to cook and begins mopping each side with his mop sauce, He sits out in the backyard and reads or talks to his wife or plays with his little boy whom he calls Honey-and about every 20 minutes, he goes back to the barbecue pit, mops the ribs, and turns them. He doesn't necessarily cover the pit, but he might, just depends.  After 4 hours, the ribs are done enough to suit Wes.  The way he can tell is this: he takes a pair of kitchen tongs and lifts up one end of the ribs.  The meat should be real flexible and bend almost double without threatening to break.

When I first started cooking ribs by this method, everybody told me I was crazy.  It couldn't possibly take 4 hours to cook little skinny ribs.  They quit arguing after they ate them.

Need I mention that if the fire is too hot you will burn them to a crisp. Take Wes's advice.  Be parsimonious with the fire.  Just a little heat, a lot of smoke, mop and turn the ribs regularly, and by nighttime you'll have the best damn barbecued ribs you ever ate.

                         Texas Cabrito Al Pastor

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

We decided to have a barbecue.  After all, I had this recipe for Cabrito Al Pastor to try out.  We all wanted to see each other.  Everyone could bring something.  We could, for a moment, recapture a piece of our shared history-the covered-dish supper.  Here's how it went.

I hadn't been home 20 minutes before my friend from the cradle, John Gililland, stopped by.  John always knows when I get home-even if nobody tells him.  Part, of the reason is that his parents' house and business is one block from my mother's house.  Part of it is ESP.

Are we going to test recipes?  John asked.  You bet your boots, I answered.  How'd you like to cook a goat outdoors?  Great, he answered.  Like his father and grandfather before him, John is the local mortician.  He is by turns either swamped with work or idle, depending on whether he "has a body." Fortunately for the recipe testing, John was not busy when I got there.  He had gone down to Close's Drug Store to drink an interminable cup of coffee when he ran into Wes Gulley, the district judge and an old South Texas ranch boy.  He told Wes our plans, and Wes said he'd help.  Wes has dressed out a lot of deer.  Good.  Now along comes another old boy in town for the class reunion, Jabe Wills, an underwater rescue teacher who lives in Southern California, wearing one of those big waterproof watches still set on California time.  He'll help, too.  So these three crowd into a telephone booth and call around.  They find a goat.

John and Jabe pick me up.  Judge goes back to court.  The three of us head for the country.  John's brought along Tecate, and he shows me how to hold the lemon in the crook of my hand, put the salt on top of the can, mix, and drink.  We head for the house of the fellow with goats.  His name is Pasqual Delgado, and he said he lives in the big house on the south side of the draw.  We can tell we are getting close when we spot the big herd of goats.

On the way out John says he had asked Pasqual how big his goats were, and Pasqual had answered, thirty dollars.  John sighs.  Anything for research.

Here we are at Delgado's.  Flat plain as far as you can see; barbed wire, a lean-to with shoats and a sow, little garden, water hose going, and everywhere children in white, barefoot and twirling on the dusty road, flapping their wings, playing a game and smiling.

We shake hands all around.  And where is the goat?  Delgado gives an expansive wave of the arm.  Alla.  We give over our thirty dollars and we all head for the herd of goats.  We leave the rope in the truck.  I have on walking shorts and Birkenstocks.  Jabe has on Adidas.  John has thought to bring along his morticianâs apron.  He knows how to keep stuff off his clothes.

Over a plowed field.  Heat shimmering, step up, step down, step up, step down.  Knock the sand out of your shoe.  Pick the sticker out of your toe. Don't touch the fence-it's hot.  Okay.  Over the single strand of wire-gingerly.  And now we see the goats maybe two hundred of them.

Delgado speaks.  You can have your choice.  He has one goat that he hadn't thought he'd sell because it is "castrate," but maybe-for forty dollars-he will let it go.  No, we say firmly.  We'll take the thirty-dollar goat. Delgado's nine-year-old girl is barefoot among all these clods and stickers.  He motions to her, then waves his arm in our direction, and we begin to move in on the black kid that he has pointed out.  The goats trot along, tense and wary but not really worried.  Delgado wants them to go through this trap that leads to the shed, but the lead goat is too smart for him and always veers just at the last moment.  By now they are milling around; we are fanned out in a semicircle.  We have trotted and run some ourselves, hearts pounding and pumping.  This time we get them headed right for the trap.  I'm positioned just past the gate to scare them from fading in the stretch, but wily old Billy takes one glance at me with that human-looking yellow eye of his, ducks his head, and runs right past me. They all sweep by, and I am scared to death they'll step on my bare toes. Run, you suckers, I holler, and take off after them.  It's hell to be a goat roper with no rope.

This sort of milling and trotting goes on until we are all heaving and blowing.  Then the lead goat gets real smart and finds a hole in Delgado's fence and leads the entire herd into a pasture holding seven cows and a range bull.  Delgado shouts and we all follow.  We chase the goats up into these cows who also begin to trot; at one point I see the bull just brush past me.  At last Delgado speaks to his nine-year-old.  She lunges under one old cow and grabs out chosen goat by the hind foot.  Goat obliges her by kicking her right in the teeth.  No worry, says Delgado, as he hands us the goat.  Back at the truck, we tie up the black kid, throw her in the back, and head for the vet's.  Good God, get out the beer.

Need I tell you that the vet says that we were all very cruel to run the poor animal down.  We put her in a pen for a few hours so that she will be composed for her last moments.

John and Jabe and I drive around Hereford for a couple of hours in this pickup, drinking Tecate, looking at the rows of elm trees the founding fathers put here to break up the treeless landscape.

We are forever shooing flies.  Feed lots ring the town now, and the air is perfumed with the smell of cow manure and the air is polka-dotted with flies.  It's been a long time since we dragged Main.

Just as the burning sun is about to drop-there is a vapor trail and a bank of clouds in the west all shimmery and magenta, I'd forgotten what a real sunset looks like-we all gather back at the office of the large-animal veterinarian.

The judge is here now, wearing his three-hundred-dollar, some rare-kind-of-creature boots and good pants and volunteering to dress the goat.

After we bleed the goat, the judge steps up and pulls out his little two-inch, razor-sharp silver penknife; and with his well manicured lawyer's hands he begins to skin and gut the goat.  He has the mild manner of a man sure of his power.  He never spills a drop of blood on himself.  He never gets hair on the meat.  He never says a word.  It strikes me as funny that the vet and the mortician are hanging back while the lawyer does the job. Standing there holding the offal bag, I am having trouble refraining from laughter.  I can see that this is a serious moment, however; so I keep a straight face.

Now John and I take the goat back to his house.  In the backyard we hose it down for a good half hour to cool the meat.  John's wife, Amy, coordinates everything.  She goes to the funeral home for folding chairs.  She makes suggestions to the twenty invited guests, and pretty soon the menu looks complete.  We have calf fries coming, and hot cowboy beans, and corn bread, and even a champagne mousse made by the most popular cheerleader from my high school class.

Just as John and I are wrapping the goat in white paper to put it in the refrigerator, his daughter Suzy interrupts, insistent.  Day after tomorrow she'll be sixteen, and she wants permission to drive a carload of friends to Amarillo.  My God, girl, John says.  I just killed a goat.  What else do you want?  That should be a birthday party fit for a princess.  She searches his face.  Is he serious?  She wavers between laughing and crying.

The next morning John calls me to come over to the funeral home.  I arrive, marveling at the overwhelming aroma of roses.  John straightens up from an ancient ledger in which he is entering figures with an Esterbrook pen.  He hands me a long grocery list.  He will be done with the books by noon, he says, and will go home to build the fire.

John and I have both seen goats cooked outdoors, on a stake.  We know how it's supposed to be done.  About two o'clock he and I talk it over.  He pokes around his workshed and comes up with a 5-foot steel stake that we ram through the goat, placing sticks between the forelegs and between the hind legs, breaking open the breastbone with an ax so that the carcass lays nice and flat the way you see them in the Mexican markets.  We rub the kid down with salt, finely milled black pepper, and crushed cloves of garlic. We lard it lightly.  The meat is so fresh and young that it is completely odorless.  It is a lovely pale veal color.

Now we hit a problem.  We can't build a fire in John's backyard and ruin the carefully nurtured grass.  Then Jabe comes along with a solution.  His father, an avid fisherman, had a blacksmith build him this strange steel contraption that looks like a big black fruit box on legs and stands about waist-high.  As best we can tell he'd fill this thing with water, and clean all the mountain trout he'd caught near Pagosa Springs in it.  Jabe and John use it to cool beer and have named it the Doctor Wills Memorial-Fish Cleaner-and-Beer-Cooler.  It must weigh two hundred pounds.  Anyway, we clean it out, put a little sand on the bottom, make a good fire of mesquite and oak, throwing in some charcoal for good measure.  We let the fire burn down, lay the staked goat a good 8 inches over the hot coals, and begin. We turn the meat every 30 minutes, holding on to the rod-kind of a giant shish kebab.  We make a foil tent over the top to encourage smoke and to discourage the ubiquitous flies.  When we notice that the thin ribs are beginning to char, we make little foil booties for them.  At the end of 2 hours, we take it off.  We know it is done because when we press the flesh, it gives nicely.  Now it is a splendid glistening caramel color.  It smells so good you could faint.

NOTES : Now in my mind this story is what REAL BBQ is all about. It is an
adventure, a happening, and a get-together and sharing with family and old
friends. It brings back some fond memories of growing up in Texas.

Charcoaled Steak From Casey's John Charles Restaurant

From: "The Only Texas Cookbook", Texas Monthly Press, 1981

Posted to the BBQ List by Linda West Eckhardt

John Casey, who owns a San Antonio steak house and has taught plenty of maverick cooks how to turn out the perfect steak, gives these hints for grilling over a charcoal fire.  Buy steaks 2 inches thick-either strip or T-bone.  Salt and pepper them.  Put the steak over a hot fire.  Cover with a roaster lid.  Don't let the cover touch the meat.  Leave for 5 minutes. Flip the steak.  Cover again.  Cook 5 minutes more.  Now you have a beautiful medium-rare steak.

     1/3  cup           ground black pepper
   3                    full slabs pork spareribs -- St. Louis cut
                        preferably 3 pounds each or less
     2/3  cup           mansion barbecue spice mix
                        bowl of beer mop sauce for meat

Apply the pepper evenly over the ribs, and then do the same with the dry rub.  Place the slabs in a plastic trash bag, and put them in the refrigerator overnight.

The next day mix the mop sauce and prepare the pit for smoking.  Cook the slabs between 200F and 220F until you feel them crack a bit between the ribs when you bend the slabs with a gloved hand, approximately 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Every 30 minutes baste both sides and turn them over.  Allow the slabs to sit 10 minutes before slicing them into individual ribs.

I use this great marinade that someone in Texas gave me for fajitas. I use it to marinate fresh veggies like onions, peppers, mushrooms and squash and throw on the grill or for chicken or an injection juice for turkey breast.

Inject 1 whole chicken (if you inject it before cooking, the spices tend to form pockets. If you inject it during cooking, the pockets aren't as bad, but you have to be careful where you inject from, otherwise you will loose a lot of precious bodily fluids through the puncture wound).

Apply your favorite rub and put the chicken in the smoker. Take it out at about 170F internal temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4  cup           cider vinegar
     3/4  cup           warm water
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      teaspoon      coarsely ground black pepper
   1      teaspoon      Hungarian paprika
   2      tablespoons   dark brown sugar
   1      tablespoon    dark molasses
   3      tablespoons   dry mustard
     1/2  cup           ketchup
     1/4  cup           chile sauce
   3      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1      clove         garlic -- pressed
   2      tablespoons   onion -- finely minced
   1      cup           butter

If you are barbecuing with a dry seasoning and/or with the mop sauce you may still wish to serve a sauce at the table.  The way I get that good Smokey flavor in the table sauce is to cook it on the edge of the grill for an hour or so while the barbecue is going.  I have a personal aversion to bottled smoke, but do like the table sauce Smokey.  Cooking the sauce outside will produce the desired effect.  You may notice a few ashes floating up into the sauce, So what?  Stir them in.  If you wish to make this sauce inside, add a little artificial smoke if you like, but don't compare it to that cooked outside.

This sauce will keep well in the refrigerator.  You can use it for oven barbecuing if you keep the temperature low, say about 275F, and cover the meat, but never use this sauce for outside barbecuing.  It will char meat because it contains both sugar and tomatoes.

In a 2-cup measure, combine vinegar and water. Stir in salt, pepper, paprika, brown sugar, molasses, and dry mustard.  Set aside to steep. Combine catsup, chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion, and butter in medium-sized saucepan.  Raise to a boil over medium-low heat. Stir in vinegar water.  Transfer to outside cooker and simmer uncovered for 1 hour or so, stirring from time to time. (If cooked indoors, simmer about 30 minutes.) Store covered in refrigerator.  Serve hot with barbecue.

                          Thai Barbecue Chicken

Recipe By     : Michael Willner
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      whole         chickens, cut up and sectioned
   1      can           coconut milk, Mae Ploy or Charokoh brands
     1/4  cup           Tiparos brand fish sauce, nam pla
   4      cloves        garlic
   1      bunch         cilantro
   1      bag           YEO's Malaysian curry powder
   1      cup           light soy sauce'


1.  On the chicken, most places uses fryers because of the slightly higher fat content.  Leave the skin on.  Don't eat the skin but it cooks better and distributes the marinade better with it on.

2.  If you use Charokoh coconut milk you may have to add about 1/4 of another can since it comes in smaller cans.

3.  Tiparos brand fish sauce is the best from Thailand but it is not a critical brand name in this recipe.  Just so you don't use dynasty or Taste of Thai or any other drug store brand name.

4.  Most important!  One bag of YEO's Malaysian Curry Powder.  Do not use any Indian curries.  You have to use this powder.  It is a product of Singapore and is available in most Oriental Markets.  It comes in 50 gram bags and is by far the best.

In blender add the coconut milk and garlic.  Blend garlic with coconut milk.  Wash about a palmfull of cilantro, leaves only then dry.  Add to blender. Add about 3/4 of the 50 gram bag of curry powder while still blending.  After about 1 minute, squirt in about 1/4 cup of the fish sauce.

Put chicken in bowl and poor marinade on top.  Mix marinade and chicken together to make sure all is covered well.  Cover and leave out at room temperature for 8 hours.  Refrigerate for at least 16 hours.  Two days is better.

Get grill hot.  I use Almond wood and some charcoal on top.  The little bit of charcoal adds to the flavor.  Put chicken on hot grill and cook.  As you put the chicken on the grill, the marinade turns back into a liquid and flows around the chicken.  Most of the marinade falls to the bottom of the grill which is fine.  Cook chicken hot and for the shortest time possible. About 5 minutes before chicken is done, pick it up with a fork or anything else and submerge it in the light soy sauce for a couple of seconds.  Put chicken back on the fire.  This turns the skin and top of the meat a nice golden brown and adds to the moisture and flavor of the curry.

When chicken is done, some restaurants put the pieces of chicken on a cutting board and pound them to crush the bone and separate the meat.  I do not do this as I find that in some restaurants, I get small pieces of bone in my mouth. 
Note:  Coconut milk has a high fat content so it does burn easily.  A hot grill does not mean a flaming grill.  Keep fire away from chicken.

NOTES : This recipe I got from a Thai restaurant in the Los Angeles area.  I liked their food so much that I volunteered to work there in the evenings for free if they would teach me how to cook my favorite recipes.  I can't give away any trade secrets but I really like this one.

   2                    beef bouillon cubes dissolved in 4 oz. -- water
   4      cloves        garlic minced
                        Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   lime or lemon juice
   1                    bottle commercial BBQ sauce

Combine all ingredients.  Marinade brisket in juice for 2 days.  Early in the morning of the day you are going to cook, remove brisket from juice and let sit at room temp.  while you get fire ready.  I am using a NBBD; have for about 9 years.  Place brisket in smoker, fat side up, and cook for about 12-14 hours at 275-325F.  I usually start about 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning and take off about 10:00 or 11:00 that night.  Baste during cooking with leftover juice.  Remove brisket from smoker and wrap in foil.  Make sure not to let any holes get in the foil of juice will leak out.  Place brisket in foil in oven and let cook over night at 150-175F.  About 1:00 or 2:00 the next afternoon, you got the best tasting, juiciest and most tender brisket you ever had.

                        Southern Succor Rub
                        Southern Sop

The night before you BBQ, combine the rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Massage the pork well with about half the rub.  Transfer the pork to a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.

Before you begin to BBQ, remove the pork from the refrigerator.  Pat down the butt with another coating of the rub.  Let the pork sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes.

Prepare smoker for BBQing, bring the temp to 200F to 220F.

Mix the ingredients for the Southern Sop and warm in a sauce pan.

Transfer the pork to the smoker and cook for about 1.5 hours per pound.  Mop the pork about once and hour.

Remove pork form the smoker and let sit for 15 minutes.  Pull off chunks of the meat, and either shred or chip them as you wish.  Make sure each service has some of the darker, chewier Mr. Brown along with the lighter interior meat.  Serve with your favorite butt sauce.

NOTES : Well, this is kind of a family recipe, but I doubt if they'll find out I
posted it.  Growing up, I would only eat my mother's cole slaw. Then one day
it occurred to me that I'd better get that recipe before it was too late.
Here it is.

   1      can           tomatoes -- 14 oz
   2      large         cloves garlic, peeled -- finely chopped
   3      whole         chipotles
                         -- (or chipotles en ado
   2      tablespoons   olive oil

The better the quality tomatoes the better the sauce or substitute 1lb skinned fresh ripe tomatoes, preferably plum. Place all ingredients in a saucepan, bring to simmering point while mashing the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon.  Simmer gently covered for 30 minutes.  If at the end of this time the sauce is too thin reduce by boiling with lid off.  Add salt to taste.

This sauce should not be extra hot, rather it should have a predominately tomato taste with an undercurrent of smoky heat.  Don't overdo the salt at the end, both dishes it is used with have salt in them.  You can also use this sauce for thin pastas like spaghetti, in which case add a medium onion, skinned and halved, at the beginning, remove it before serving and add chopped fresh basil to the sauce 5 minutes before serving.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Pork
                Ribs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      pounds        baby back ribs or 4 lbs. pork spareribs
   1      batch         barbecue sauce--separate recipes follow

1. Often when you buy ribs at the butcher counter, you get a full rack of ribs that wouldn't fit on a plate. Usually you just have to cut these long racks in half to get the perfect serving size (about 4 to 6 rib bones per rack). You'll likely have 4 of these smaller racks at about a pound each.

2. Preheat the oven to 300F.

3. Tear off 4 pieces of aluminum foil that are roughly 6 inches longer than the ribs.

4. Coat the ribs, front and back, with your choice of barbecue sauce. Place a rack of ribs, one at a time, onto a piece of foil lengthwise and wrap it tightly.

5. Place the ribs into the oven with the seam of the foil wrap facing up. Cook for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until you see the meat of the ribs shrinking back from the cut ends of the bones by about 1/2 inch. This long cooking time will ensure that the meat will be very tender and fall off the bone.

6. Toward the end of the cooking time, prepare the grill.

7. Remove the ribs from the foil and smother them with additional barbecue sauce. Be sure to save some sauce for later.

8. Grill the ribs over hot coals for 2 to 4 minutes per side, or just until you see several spots of charred blackened sauce. Watch for flames and do not burn!

9. When the ribs are done, use a sharp knife to slice the meat between each bone about halfway down. This will make it easier to tear the ribs apart when they are served.

TIDBITS

If you've got the time to marinate these ribs in advance, do it. I've found these ribs are extraordinary when they've been soaking in barbecue sauce for 24 hours before cooking. Just prepare the ribs in the foil described in the recipe and keep them in your refrigerator. Toss them, foil and all, into the oven the next day, 2 to 2-1/2 hours before you plan to scarf out.

   1      cup           ketchup

     1/2  cup           brown sugar

     1/4  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/4  teaspoon      onion powder

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a medium saucepan over high heat, and whisk until smooth.

2. Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30-40 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Use on pork spareribs -- as cooked with the method from the book Top Secret Restaurant Recipes -- or any of your beef, pork or chicken recipes.

Of the four famous barbecue sauces served on those delicious, tender ribs at Tony Roma's, this is the only one that wasn't cloned in the third book, Top Secret Restaurant Recipes. This sweet, smoky sauce is great on pork spareribs cooked with the technique found on page 298 of the book, or you can use it on a recipe of your own that includes pork or beef ribs, even chicken. Now Tony Roma's sells each of its four barbecue sauces at the restaurant chain, separately, or in gift sets of four. But if you don't have a Tony Roma's near you, this is the only way to get that one-of-a-kind barbecue taste at home.

                        ***For the garnish***
   1      medium        Haas Avocado -- peeled and sliced
   1      cup           Monterey jack cheese -- grated
                        lime or lemon juice -- freshly squeezed

* Corn Tortillas should be cut into 1/2-inch wide strips.

Brown the chicken in two non-stick skillets in 2 tablespoons of olive or peanut oil until golden brown.  Do not burn the chicken or the drippings in the pan.

While chicken is browning, sauté the onions and garlic in a little oil until translucent.  Transfer to stock pot.

When chicken is browned, transfer chicken and chicken fat to the stock pot. Deglaze the skillets with some of the water and transfer to the stock pot.  Add the remaining water, the chicken broth,  basil leaves, paprika, and chilies.  Add salt and pepper.  Cover the pot and simmer for 2 hours.

Remove chicken pieces and debone the meat.  Put the stock through a strainer and discard all solids that are not good chicken meat.  Chop the chicken into 1/4" chunks and return to stock pot along with the chopped tomatoes.

Skim as much of the chicken fat off surface of soup as possible and discard.  Or put soup in refrigerator overnight and remove crystallized fat and discard.

Heat the frying oil in a 10-inch skillet until hot.

Cook tortilla strips a few at a time in oil until light golden brown, 30 to 60 seconds; drain on paper towels.

Store-bought tortilla can be substituted but use restaurant style.

Serving:
Place a handful of tortilla strips in a bowl and pour hot soup over tortilla strips. Give each bowl of soup a dash of lime/lemon juice, as much as a teaspoon. Top each bowl of soup with some of the grated cheese and a few avocado slices.

   2      tablespoons   nuoc nam

     1/4  teaspoon      red chile flakes
   1      shot          vodka
   3      sprigs        creasy greens -- slivered
   1      stalk         celery
   2      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
                        V-8 vegetable juice, or tomato juice
   1                    quartered lime

I call this "Tournament Greens Bloody Mary" because the creasy greens start to grow big enough to harvest right around the time of the ACC and NCAA basketball tournaments.

First, combine the nuoc nam, garlic, and chile flakes to make nuoc cham (a Vietnamese dipping sauce). Take creasy greens, place in food processor, and finely sliver. Put shot of vodka into a chilled glass, add nuoc cham, slivered greens, Worcestershire sauce, and V-8 or tomato juice. Squeeze quartered lime slightly into the glass, then place firmly on edge of glass.

If you don't have creasy greens (barbarea verna), substitute watercress.

1st A LITTLE HISTORY: Tower Rock BBQ Team gets its name from a small town in Southern Illinois where my parents grew up. It sits on the Mississippi River. The tall rock formation in the river called, "Tower Rock" gave the town the name "Grand Tower". Our team consists of 8 members gather to form a champion in its self: Pat and Aliene Burke formerly from Apple City BBQ (Three Times World Grand Champions) had retired from BBQing but as everyone knows its in your blood they missed the people and friends and the competition, so here they are along with Brice and Elaine Winfrey, John Close ( all from Summerville, Tn.) and of course My family: Ed Shelby, Kellie Jacobs 11, and myself. Each member has brought its own flair to the team including Kellie who is the main producer of our Tower Rock BBQ Sauce.

NOW: OUR WHOLE HOG STORY

We start with a hog that is chosen from a small farmer here in southern Illinois and send it to our processor. Where he processes it to our specification of removing the skin and leaving the head. We only cook fresh hogs they are processed on Monday and we pick up on Thursday for competition. We feel you get a better product using fresh meat. When we arrive at the competition site the prep work begins. We work on a time schedule which takes a total of 26 hours:

We start with a hog that dresses out around 120LBS.

9:00a.m.--------remove hog from ice and trim fat to 1/4" thickness. remove any debris left from the processing. Split the back bone open just enough to make lie flat but not lose all of its shape. We then sprinkle a little salt inside, and out ( we use a sea salt for this) Then we add our special magic dust (rub) which is a combination of chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, white pepper, celery salt, garlic powder, brown sugar. ( can't give the measurements) they are locked in a safe until the demise of my father. After the special treatment of preparation we then secure a body rack to the cavity of the hog and a rack top and bottom the length of the hog.

11:00----------The hog is then named (Phillip Ingram Garcia) and loaded into the cooker belly down (which was designed and built by my husband and my father). There are two baskets under the hog that are filled with 10 to 15 pounds of charcoal each, we only use a pure hickory with cornstarch binder) and add about 1/2 gallon bucket of apple chips to the charcoal then we fire it with a propane torch - no lighter fluid!. We bring the temperature up to 190F. We then bring the internal temperature of the hog up to 170F and hold there for approximately 4 hours. We use the old smoke house theory of meat will take on smoke when its cool. Once the temperature rises above 170F, the meat starts to cook outwards therefore no longer drawing the smoke in. After the 4 hours we start to raise the internal temperature of the hog to 185 to 190degrees. We maintain a 200F setting on the temperature of the cooker from here on out.

6:00pm--------We then flip the hog to its back. This allows for the basting sauce to lay in cavity of the hog. We baste every hour on the hour, up until 4:00 a.m. During this process we are checking that the internal temp. of the hog is ok and that the shoulders and hams are getting tender. We keep our baskets under the shoulders and ham most of the time.

4:00am--------At this time we wrap foil around the head, and lay foil (with slips across the belly to keep it from darkening to much. We maintain temperature at 200F until 30 minutes before judging. Then we begin our ritual of removing the meat for the blind box and dressing the hog for a formal meeting with the judges.

This is our main process of cooking a hog. We hope that it will help a few and give a few ideas to others.....our cooker has been out on the circuit for over a year and has brought us nothing but good luck. We wish all of you good luck with your hog. Tower Rock BBQ Team

                        Traditional Achiote Recado

Recipe By     : "La Parilla the Mexican Grill" by Reed Hearon

Categories    : Bbq List                         Mexican

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      Tablespoons   annatto seeds
     1/2  cup           water
   1      teaspoon      freshly ground allspice
   2      teaspoons     freshly ground black pepper
     1/2  cup           ancho chile powder
   4      teaspoons     kosher salt
   1      Tablespoon    Mexican oregano -- toasted and ground
   3      cloves        garlic
     1/2  medium        white onions -- thickly sliced
     1/4  cup           pineapple vinegar or apple cider vinegar
   1 1/2  cups          freshly squeezed orange juice
     1/4  cup           freshly squeezed lemon juice

Annatto seeds are the hard red seeds of the annatto tree, native to the tropics. They are softened by soaking in hot water for 2 hours before grinding for use. Annatto seeds tint foods a bright yellow and are familiar to you as the dye used to color Cheddar cheese orange and butter yellow.

Achiote paste is a moist, brick-colored seasoning paste available in most Mexican and Latin American food markets. It is a blend of the iodiney seeds of the annatto tree, citrus juices, vinegar plus other spices. The flavor will vary with brand and freshness, so be sure to taste it before using. It keeps indefinitely, tightly covered, at room temperature.

This mild, citrusy red spice paste can transform the blandest of foods. It comes from the Yucatan, where it typically flavors Pibil-style suckling pig. The pig is rubbed with the recado, wrapped in banana leaves, and then cooked in a stone-lined pit until the meat is so tender it falls off the bones. Grilling is a less traditional, but no less delicious, method. Use for meat, fish, and poultry. Purchased achiote paste saves a good deal of time and makes a less complex but acceptable recado.

Pan roast garlic and onion until brown and soft, then peel the garlic.

Put the annatto seeds and water in a small saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower heat to a simmer. Cook 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep 2 hours, or until softened. Drain and put in a blender or food processor along with all the remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Keeps, tightly covered, up to 5 days in the refrigerator.

Makes about 2 1/2 cups

1) Place fish on porcelain veggie grate sprayed with Pam. Don't remove the heads! 
2) Use a marinade and fridge the fish for 1 hour, max. Fresh squeezed lemon or lime (very different taste) mixed with vegetable. oil works well. 
3) Get good smoke goin' before putting the fish in. Trout can take quite a bit, and oak, alder, mesquite are decent choices. 
4) Brush the inside cavity with a mixture of Dijon mustard and Miracle Whip, with a few squeezes of lemon.

5) Brush the skin with oil and crank some pepper inside and out. 
6) Spray baste fish after the first half hour. No need to turn them. 
7) Fish should be done in and hour or less (at 225F grill temperature). 
8) You ought to be able to pull out the entire skeleton as one piece, w/o even one bone left. 
9) Serve with a few tablespoons of sauce (Dijon, Miracle Whip, lemon juice) next to it.

You can use all of the above, or improvise with various spices/herbs. Fresh thyme or rosemary, cilantro and lime juice, and even chipotles in adobo sauce if you want to kick it up a notch! I sometimes use chipotle powder in melted margarine with some lemon juice.

                     	roasting chickens (one or two)
                        garlic cloves

Peel the garlic cloves (leaving them whole) and after loosening the skin of the birds insert them under the skin, using as many as you like, but at least 6-7 cloves for each bird. 
I use a Weber kettle, and build an indirect pile against one side of the grill, meanwhile have several chunks of hickory soaking in water.  When the coals are ready, put the hickory chips on.

You can brush the chicken with soy sauce if you like, but it is not necessary.

Put the birds on the opposite side from the coals, adjust the vents and go about your business. Usually takes about 2 hours to cook them.

If you make and eat this chicken, I think you will be happy to add it to your repertoire.

   1      pound         ham -- diced

***If you DON'T have any leftovers, begin here:***
Place turkey carcass in large sauce pot w/water to cover.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on top.  Stir and let boil about 1 1/2 hrs.  Remove carcass and meat, reserving broth.  Go on to next step below.

***If you DO have leftovers, begin here:***
Cut turkey into bite sized pieces. Brown flour in oil to make a dark roux. Add vegetables and stir till soft.  Stir in a cup or so of hot stock, then pour roux into stock pot w/reserved broth.  Cook 1/2 hour, then add tomatoes, turkey, seasonings, and ham and cook another 1/2 hr.  Serve w/ rice, file (ground sassafras leaves), and Tabasco.  Serves 8-10.

NOTE:  Gumbo gets better and better the longer it sits.  Make it a day or two ahead, if you can.  Also, you may add chopped okra (the word "gumbo" comes from an African word for okra) when you add your other vegetables, but watch your roux if you do--the okra will make it thicken very quickly.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***See Directions***      

1st Way: 

1. Make about a 1/4 cup of roux. Heat equal amounts of drippings fat and flour in a sauce or fry pan stirring constantly. I think it is easiest to heat the fat to just slightly bubbling and then add a little flour at a time, stirring constantly. You will be making a paste from this combination, so add a little more flour at a time until you form a nice paste.  This paste (roux) is your thickening agent for the rest of the drippings. So the amount of roux that you want is dependent on the total amount of gravy you want to end up with.

2. In a separate pan heat the remainder of your drippings to just bubbling. I like to use a flat 9" X 13" cake pan for this step. It has about 2inch sides and I find the large surface makes smooth stirring much easier than a round pan.

3. Slowly add the roux to the entire drippings liquid until it thickens to your liking. I use a large flat heat-resistant plastic or wooden spoon  to sort of constantly scrape the bottom of this pan. This process basically keeps the roux from sticking to the bottom of the pan while it is becoming gravy. Hope this is not too confusing.  If it never gets thick enough, then you need more roux. It will take a few times, like Qing, to get the hang of the mix you like.

4. If you like you can perkup the gravy a bit with spices. I usually add a little salt and pepper and just a tad of Adobo Con Pepper. The Adobo is not required, I just like it because it has a combination of a lot of spices that I like. Goya makes several Adobo spice blends that are nice. Once thickened, you have your gravy. 

2nd Way:

1. Heat up all of the drippings in a 9" X 13" pan.

2. In a shaker container combine 1-3 ratio of flour and COLD water. Shake like hell. You can add spices to this mixture if you like. The "shaking" action is to get all of the lumps out of the new formation. (The ratio of flour to water is sort of a guess. I usually add several tablespoons to a 1/2cup of water.) This is your thickening agent. 

3. When your drippings are bubbling, slowly add the flour/water
mixture, stirring constantly. 

4. Watch for thickening action and be careful not to add too much flour/water mixture or you'll have glue. The thickening action is slightly delayed after you add a bit of flour/water stir a while and see if it is thickening. If you end up with glue, just add a small amount of water. You want to limit doing this, as you will weaken the flavors you worked so hard to obtain. 

5. Be sure to constantly scrape or move the thickening gravy from the bottom of the pan as you go.  Once thickened, you have your gravy.

NOTES : Anytime you smoke or grill a turkey, put a drip pan underneath it and catch the drippings. Then use the drippings as a base for your gravy and you'll never even think of "brown gravy" with smoked turkey again.  I usually grill our Thanksgiving Turkey (on a Weber) using indirect heat. I catch all the wonderful flavors of the turkey in the drip pan directly below it.  You will end up with quite a bit of fat, and you can throw some of it away if you are concerned about fat, but don't be foolish and toss it all.  Lately, I have used the entire catchings as a base for a large amount of gravy. To make the gravy:

By "heat up" in the following directions, I mean on the stove top.  I have electric elements which take effect much more slowly than gas. So, if you have a gas stove...beware. (As if you did not already know that.) I just thought a little overkill would be okay for those not comfortable using a stove top.

   1      tablespoon    dill -- chopped.

Wrap cucumber in several thicknesses of paper towels and press out all moisture.  Combine cucumber with remaining ingredients and mix well.  Transfer to serving bowl.  Chill.  Yield 2 cups.

I've made the first recipe and it tastes pretty close to what you get on a commercial gyro, here in California.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          plain yogurt
   2      large         cucumbers
                        salt to taste
   2      large         cloves garlic -- minced
   1 1/2  tablespoons   white wine vinegar
   1      tablespoon    olive oil
                        fresh ground black pepper

Line a sieve with a damp cheesecloth and place over a large bowl.  Dump the   yogurt into the sieve, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to drain in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Peel the cucumbers. Cut them in half lengthwise. Using a teaspoon, scrape out and discard the seeds. Grate the cucumbers into a colander, using the large holes on a four-sided grater. Salt the cucumbers and allow them to drain for 1/2 hour. Place the garlic, vinegar, and olive oil in a bowl and marinate while the cucumbers are draining. Squeeze the drained cucumbers as dry as possible and blot on paper towels.

Place in the bowl with the marinated garlic.  Add the drained yogurt and stir.  Add a few grindings of fresh pepper and salt if necessary.  Let the finished product sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to blend. 
Serve any way you can think of.

            Uncle Ho's Most Decidedly Eastern Finishing Sauce

Recipe By     : Tom Solomon

Categories    : Bbq List                         Barbecue Sauce
                Carolina-Style Bbq Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16      ounces        apple cider vinegar
   1      tablespoon    red pepper flakes
   1 1/2  tablespoons   Phu Quoc brand nuoc nam
   1      teaspoon      ground cayenne pepper
     1/2  teaspoon      black pepper

As a long time aficionado of Eastern North Carolina style barbeque, I have been intrigued by the origins of the vinegar/red pepper sauce used by the pit masters in that region. It is unique among all barbeque finishing or dipping sauces in that in contains no tomato extracts--owing to the fact that, at the time of it's origins in the 1600s and 1700s, tomatoes were thought to be poisonous. What was used instead was "English Ketchup", a concoction containing cider vinegar, red peppers, spices, and oysters. This basic blend is in use to this day with one notable exception--the oysters have been discarded.

Well, I got to wondering what that original barbeque might have tasted like, seasoned with the English Ketchup of the time. Having no reference and no clue as to how oysters were incorporated into the original mix, I instead decided to substitute nuoc nam--a Vietnamese fish sauce made from fish extract, water, and salt. While I cannot say this is an exact replication of the nation's original barbeque finishing and dipping sauce, it is in all likelihood a pretty decent semblance of what our colonial ancestors seasoned their barbeque with. In addition, it's also pretty damn tasty, IMHO--complementing, rather than masking, the smoky rich sweetness of slow cooked barbeque.

Simply combine all ingredients, and let alone to marry for one or two days before using. If you use it as a finishing sauce, add about 12 ounces of the sauce to roughly three pounds of smoked and pulled pork barbeque in a cast iron pan, add water to cover, and simmer on medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sauce *just* barely oozes over the barbeque when pressed down upon with a spatula. Or, just mix with smoked and pulled pork barbeque before serving if using as a dip.

Enjoy!

NOTES : It is very important to use authentic Vietnamese nuoc nam in this recipe--that is, a nuoc nam made in Vietnam, with Phu Quoc brand being considered the best brand widely available. Nuoc nam made in Thailand tends to be too coarse and salty in taste to blend well with the other ingredients, and thus produces too much of a pronounced fish and salt taste to suit fine barbeque.

   2      teaspoons     Hot or sweet Hungarian paprika
     1/2  teaspoon      cayenne

Sauté the onion in the oil over medium- high heat until translucent, add the minced garlic, reduce heat to medium and continue cooking for another min.  or two.  Add the tomato sauce and stir well to mix.  Add the remaining ingredients, one at a time, down to and including the honey, stir after each ingredients.

Add the spice blend ingredients to a spice grinder down to and including the clove.  Grind up all the ingredients until you get a medium fine, somewhat grainy result.  Add the habanero and the paprika and blend together.

Stir in the spice mixture to the sauce, 1 teaspoon at a time until you find the heat/flavor level you like (about 4-5 average).  Add the cayenne (optional) and stir. After a min.  or so add the bourbon and the lemon juice and let the sauce heat for another five minute or so, stirring every now and again.  Turn off heat let sauce steep for at least 1/2 hour or more to let flavors meld. Taste and adjust your spice mixture.  Serve as a hot table sauce.  This is not a marinade or a cooking sauce, although you might add a light brushing to your meat or chicken about 15 min.  before removing from grill.

Orange-Habanero-Chipotle oil 3-4 Chipotle dried peppers, 1 dried habanero, 2-3 tbs. dried orange peel minced, 2 cups canola oil.  In a spice mill combine the dry ingredients and grind fine.  Combine the spice mix with the canola oil in a clean GLASS jar with a non-reactive top.  let the mixture sit in a cool place away from sunlight, for 2-3 days, shaking the jar 2-3 times per day.  Filter the oil through a paper coffee filter into a clean glass jar.  Can be stored in the fridge up to 6 months.  Note: It may take some time for the oil to run through the filter completely.

   1                    cinnamon stick
   8      sprigs        cilantro -- fresh
   1                    lime -- juiced
     1/4  teaspoon      salt -- to taste
     1/4  teaspoon      ground black pepper -- to taste

To cook chilies:  In medium saucepan, combine pasilla, ancho, and arbol chilies and 1.5 cups chicken stock.  Rapidly bring to a boil.  Reduce heat.

Simmer for 10 minutes, or until chilies are soft, stirring occasionally.  Cool slightly.  Pour into blender.  Add tortillas.

Puree until smooth (Note: If chile mixture is too thick to puree, add additional chicken stock, 1 tablespoon at a time, as necessary).  Set aside.

To cook chili:  In large sauté pan, heat corn oil over medium high heat.  When oil smokes, add meat cubes.  Cook, stirring frequently for 3 to 5 minutes, or until just brown.

Using slotted spoon, remove meat from pan.  Set aside.  While oil is still hot, stir in onion.  Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until well browned.

Add garlic and cumin.  Cook for 1 minute.  Add chili puree.  Fry for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent scorching.  Mixture will be thick and dark.

Add meat, beer, and beef stock.  Stir well.  Reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, or until reduced by half.  Remove from heat.  Stir in cinnamon and cilantro bundle.

Set aside, without stirring, for 15 minutes.  Remove and discard cinnamon and cilantro.  Stir in lime juice.  Season with salt and pepper.

Will be cooking a 4 lb. roast on an ECB using Cowboy Way Hardwood Lump Charcoal and hickory I'll cut into chunks from a log I was given.  Total cooking time should be no more than four hours.  I usually judge the doneness of venison by feel, kind of like Belly's "wabba wabba" feel for brisket.  An hour per pound is usually just right with the temp just below the I on the idiot temp gage that comes with the ECB.  Maybe this year I'll actually try to figure out what that temp really is.

3rd.  day: Repeat above

4th.  day: Divide into 5 equal parts (1 1/2 lbs. each).  Shape into 5 rolls (12-14" long) You can either back on broiler rack in oven for 8 1/2 hours, or can use smoker and smoke until done.  I have a Gander Mountain brand electric smoker with the water pan. I used it the last time I made the sausage and smoked it for 4 hours.  Much better tasting than using the oven.  Only problem is that my smoker has no settings, just plugs in.

My buddy, the GA shrimp fisherman, teach me a secret, how you take a Vidalia, peel it, push a bullion cube down into the top, dab of butter, wrap in Saran, zap it short time until it little tender to touch, let sit.  When it cool enough to hold, peel saran back and eat it like a juicy apple. Alternate bites with BBQ.

   2      16Oz Cans     whole peeled tomatoes
  20      Cloves        garlic
   2                    Jalapeno peppers -- chopped
   1                    chipotle pepper -- crumbled
   2      Ribs          celery
   1      Medium        yellow onion
   8      tablespoons   nuoc nam
   5      tablespoons   apple cider vinegar
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   2      tablespoons   sugar
   2      tablespoons   black pepper
   1      tablespoon    brown mustard seeds -- crushed
   1      tablespoon    paprika
   1      tablespoon    ground hot red pepper -- preferably dried tab
   1      tablespoon    whole cumin seed
   1      teaspoon      oregano -- crushed

Here's a salsa recipe I've been playing around with for about a month or so. Originally, I wanted to "wrap" a salsa around a core of nuoc cham, with a hint of a Cajun hot sauce thrown in for good measure. The end result was a bit of a hybrid, but it seems to have worked out fairly well. Anyway, enjoy--it's a hot one!

Peel (if necessary) and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place in a saucepan. Add coarsely chopped onion, celery, and jalapenos. Peel and finely dice the garlic, add half now and reserve the other half.

Grind the cumin seed and add it along with the nuoc nam, vinegar, Worcestershire, paprika, ground red pepper, and three tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce to a moderate simmer, and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until desired thickness is achieved.

Now, about 5 minutes before the salsa is done, fry the reserved garlic in a little oil until it is crispy and golden. Remove the salsa from heat, add the fried garlic with one tablespoon of sugar, and stir occasionally until the salsa cools (stops steaming).

This should keep for between 1 and 2 weeks at 40F. The recipe makes between 1.5 and 2 quarts of salsa.

   1      1/2 inch      ginger root -- crumbled
     1/2  teaspoon      dried chile peppers or more

This recipe is equally good with wild duck, partridge or ptarmigan.

Cut the breasts away from the bird and marinade at least two days in the other ingredients. The peppers can be increased up to 2 tsp. according to taste. Drain breasts and place on the grill of your pit, brushing on extra marinade as required. Remove when internal temperature in deepest part of breast reaches 160F.  Do not over cook. Serve with rice.

     1/3  cup           sugar
   1      tablespoon    Tabasco

Marinate overnight and grill. It will flare up and about the only thing to do is either keep a squirt bottle nearby or my preference is to keep the garden hose ready and waiting. For production jobs (cooking for a party) we use two grills, one to start the cooking at a slightly higher heat (most of the flare- ups) and one at a lower heat to finish (very few flare-ups). Use your own judgment on when to switch grills - it should come natural even for novices, for some reason it'll just look like it's time.

Combine the pepper, garlic, lime juice, vinegar, mustard, oil, molasses, turmeric, and slat in a blender and puree until smooth.  Correct the seasoning, adding more salt or molasses to taste.

Transfer the sauce to a clean bottle.  You can use it right away, but the flavor will improve if you let it age for a few days.  Volcanic Hot Sauce will keep almost indefinitely, refrigerated or at room temperature.  Just give it a good shake before using.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           tomato ketchup
     1/2  cup           cider vinegar
   1      teaspoon      sugar
   1      teaspoon      chili powder
     1/8  teaspoon      salt
   1 1/2  cups          water
   3      stalks        celery -- chopped
   3                    bay leaves
   1      clove         garlic
   2      tablespoons   chopped onion
   4      tablespoons   butter
   4      tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
   1      teaspoon      paprika
   1      dash          black pepper

Combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil.  Simmer about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain.

(note - the celery pieces that you strain out from the sauce are among the most delicious things I have ever tasted - really wonderful.  In fact, I sometimes made the sauce just to have some of the yummy celery. - Bruce)

NOTES : This is the secret of the ages I am giving you here, and I would not be surprised if wars have been fought over less.  Use this as a plate or table sauce with beef, chicken, pork or almost anything else.  Don't cook things in it.

   2                    strips bacon -- partially cooked,
                         -- chopped

Mix all together, put in a covered casserole, lay two strips bacon on top, bake covered in 375F oven for 30 minutes, and then remove the cover and cook for another 30 minutes.

I usually skip the bacon and add some pulled pork if I have some in the refrigerator.

Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bbq List                         Rubs And Spices

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      teaspoons     Hungarian paprika
   1      teaspoon      salt
   2      teaspoons     onion powder
   2      teaspoons     black pepper
   1 1/2  teaspoons     white pepper
   1      teaspoon      cayenne
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
   1 1/2  teaspoons     dry mustard
   1 1/2  teaspoons     granulated brown sugar

In a 16 ounce jar, with a lid, add all ingredients.  Close lid and shake until all spices are well blended.  If for some reason you use some brown sugar rather than granulated, make sure that it is broken up to a very fine state, and it is mixed well with the other ingredients.

This may be stored in a lidded glass container for several weeks at room temperature.

This rub is very good on pork.  It is very low in salt and brings out the flavor of the pork.  Just sprinkle it very liberally on either ribs or a pork butt and let stand for 30 or 40 minutes.  It will start to have a wet look.  Now is the time to put in the smoker.  If you would like a little more heat in your dry rubs add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper.

NOTES : A few years ago, David Burks was flying from Atlanta, back to his home in the Phoenix area. Just by chance, he happened sit next to a man, that during their conversation, claimed he had won a Memphis In May event the year before.  During the conversation he gave David a recipe for a dry rub.  After Dave got home it didn't take him long to post it on the Prodigy cooking bulletin board.  Since then I have made a number of modifications to the rub and have come up with something that I think, for me, is the best yet.

                         -- chopped (to 15 chili
                        for a milder curry, use a few jalapenos
   1                    ripe mango, peeled, pitted and -- mashed
   1      cup           cheap yellow mustard
     1/4  cup           packed brown sugar
     1/4  cup           white vinegar
   1      tablespoon    curry powder
   1      tablespoon    ground cumin
   1      tablespoon    chili powder
     1/2  teaspoon      salt -- or to taste
   1      teaspoon      black pepper -- or to taste

WARNING: This is a very hot sauce if made with habanero or Scotch Bonnet peppers.  Use this to enhance dull and boring food.  Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children, and bad advice.  This is not a toy.  This is serious.  Stand up straight, sit right, and stop mumbling.  Be careful not to rub your nose, eyes, or mouth while working with habaneros.  You may actually want to wear rubber gloves while chopping and mixing -- these babies are powerful.

Mix all the ingredients together and stand back.  This will keep, covered and refrigerated, until the year 2018.  Be careful though: If it spills, it will eat a hole in your refrigerator.  If you ever want to dispose of it, call the local toxic waste specialists.

NOTES : This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is basically habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and yellow mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in.  Use this recipe as a guideline.  Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper heat scale, so feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.

Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your imagination run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests regarding its origins.  If you're having trouble, here's a start: "One day in Jamaica I was in this dingy bar and met this old guy who..." and you take it from there.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        kosher salt
   1      large         egg
                        sugar
                        OR brown sugar

  10      pounds        meat -- poultry, fish or
                         -- shellfish, up to 12

TO PREPARE: Pour 1 gallon cold water into a nonmetallic kettle or bucket.  Stir in 2 cups kosher salt.  Add the egg in its shell to the salted water.  If egg does not float, add additional salt, 1 tbs. at a time (keeping track of how much salt you add), until egg floats to the surface.  Remove egg, then add enough sugar to equal the amount of salt you have already added; stir to dissolve.

Add meat, poultry, fish or shellfish of choice, making sure that the food is submerged.  Transfer kettle to the refrigerator and let stand for Brining time specified in Guide to Brining and Smoking, page 61

Remove meat of fish from brine; reserve and refrigerate brine for another use another time.  Let meat or fish stand at room temp until a translucent glaze or pellicle forms on its surface, about 1 hour.  Then smoke for period specified in Guide to Brining and Smoking, page 61

Makes 1 gallon.  This brine can be stored in the refrigerator and reused 3 times, as long as each time, it is used to brine only the same food.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 3/4  cups          dry white wine
     1/2  cup           lime juice -- freshly squeezed
   1 1/2  teaspoons     mustard powder
   1      medium        red onion -- sliced 1/4" thick
     1/2  cup           olive oil
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

Combine all ingredients in a non reactive bowl.  Cover, and refrigerate over night to allow flavors to meld.  Then add meat to the bowl, covering all sides with the marinade, and then recover and allow to marinate for at least 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator.  Or, I prefer to add the meat and marinade to a zip lock bag and refrigerate.  This way seems to coat the meat better.

This marinade can be used with fish, poultry, fowl, pork, or veal.  When marinating fish, chickens, or fowl, do not let it marinate more than the 3 to 4 hours or else it will start to "cook" the meat.  The pork and veal can be left up to 24 hours in the marinade with no problems.

Cut off the skin (this lets the smoke penetrate more), but leave the fat. Put a basic rub on it.  If you don't have one handy, some salt, pepper, and a little garlic will work just fine.  Cook slow at 220-225F, and keep the smoke going fairly often.  I like to Q mine till the temp reaches 175F or higher---remember, this isn't as lean as a pork loin, so you can go to a higher temp. Makes it really tender if you bring it up easy.
 About 30 minutes before done, baste a couple of times with this mixture: 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup mustard, 1/4 cup vinegar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      whole         suckling pig -- (10-14 lb.),
     1/3  cup           plain distilled vinegar
   1 1/2  cups          carrots -- chopped or sliced
   1 1/2  cups          celery -- chopped or sliced
   1 1/2  cups          onions -- chopped or sliced
     1/3  cup           safflower oil
   1      tablespoon    coarse salt
   1      teaspoon      thyme
                        stuffing *(instead of vegetables)
                        olive oil
   1      cup           stock
   1      cup           wine
   1      small         red apple
   1      bunch         watercress
   2      tablespoons   flour
   2      tablespoons   butter

Have your butcher prepare the hog by cleaning it and removing the hair.

THE DAY BEFORE COOKING, WASH pig inside and out; soak it in very cold water with vinegar for a few hours. This freshens and whitens the meat. If you pig is frozen, it can also defrost during this soaking. 
Over a medium heat cook the carrots, celery and onions in the oil for a good 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The onions should become somewhat translucent, the carrots slightly caramelized. Add salt and thyme. Dry the pig thoroughly inside and out. You may stuff the pig with the vegetables at this time; however, if you use a conventional stuffing, such as one for a turkey, wait until just before cooking and make certain that the pig and stuffing are at room temperature. 
The easiest way to close the opening is to use an ice pick or an upholstery needle to punch rows of holes about an inch apart on both sides of the stomach flaps. Then lace it up with thick string just as you would a shoe. You may also use skewers and string as you would for a turkey. Because protein firms as it cooks, the pig will stay in whatever position you place it. It should resemble a dog resting on its haunches. Place the pig in the roasting pan; it may have to be placed diagonally. Tuck the hind legs close to the stomach on either side; tie them together with string under the stomach if needed. The forelegs should be pointing straight ahead (also tied together so they won't spread out) and the head resting between them. Place a small piece of wood (like a child's block) or a piece of bunched-up foil in the mouth, opening it as wide as you can. Twist the tail into a curl and secure it with string or tape. Place crumpled aluminum foil in the eye sockets (some people place marbles). 
At this point you may cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it. Before cooking the pig, let it come to room temperature. Preheat oven to 450F. With the oil, thoroughly baste every inch of the pig, including the head, legs and tail. Out of aluminum foil make little covers for the ears and tail. If your pig hangs over the pan, use heavy-duty foil to extend the pan so that any juices will be collected. Place the pig in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the pig quickly, shutting the oven door, baste with oil again and return to the oven. Then reduce the temperature to 350F. Continue basting with oil every 20 minutes 4 to 5 more times (for a total of 2 hours). If the ears and tail haven't browned, remove the aluminum covers for the last 20 minutes. The total cooking time will be between 2 and 2 1/2 hours. The cooking time is less because it is not fully stuffed; if it were, it would take an hour longer. (Approximately 10 minutes per pound lightly stuffed or unstuffed; 15 minutes per pound fully stuffed.) 
The pig is done when the temperature of the thigh reaches 165F (trichinae are killed when the internal temperature reaches 139F for a period of 10 minutes). When done, it may easily rest for an hour under foil or in a turned-off oven. To serve, make a garland for the pig's neck by stringing together sprigs of watercress. Make certain your apple is nicely polished. 
Enlist some help and very carefully slide the pig onto the platter or carving board it will be presented on. It is rather fragile at this point and can even break in half. 
Make a sauce by skimming the fat off the juices in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan over 2 burners, add the stock and the wine and bring to the simmer. Stir to dissolve all the roasting juices coagulated on the bottom and continue cooking about 10 minutes. If you wish to thicken the sauce, whisk in 2 tablespoons of flour that have been blended with 2 tablespoons of butter, bring the sauce back to the boil and boil for 2 minutes, stirring. Remove any remaining foil, string or skewers. 
Place the apple in the pig's mouth. Place the watercress garland around its neck and bring it to the table.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        chili meat
     1/4  cup           oil
   1                    onion -- chopped
   2      cloves        garlic -- chopped
  16      ounces        tomato sauce
   1      teaspoon      paprika
   1 1/2  teaspoons     cayenne pepper
   2      cups          water
     1/3  cup           chili powder
   2      teaspoons     salt
   2      teaspoons     ground oregano
   1      teaspoon      cumin
   2      teaspoons     masa corn flour

Brown meat in oil. Drain and set aside.

Sauté onion and garlic in same oil; and add beef and all ingredients *except masa*.

Cook until tender (1 1/2 hrs.)

If not from Texas, or do not have a bunch of kids and need to s-t-r-e-a-c-h your budget, add 4 cups canned kidney beans.  Beans will tend to tighten the chili and give it some body.  If you do not add beans, then... Add some water to masa to make loose paste and add to mix while stirring. This will *draw* chili tighter.

   1      gallon        water
     3/4  cup           salt

     3/4  cup           sugar
   1      teaspoon      dried oregano
   1      teaspoon      thyme
   1      teaspoon      black pepper

I just pulled my first brined turkey of the smoker.  I have always rubbed with kosher salt.  Used William O'Reilly's brine for 16 hours.  The skin is salty and crisp.  I should have taken it off at 170 and let it rise but I didn't.  Took it off at 180.  The meat is tender, moist and not salty.  The texture of the meat was affected much deeper than with a rub.  If you don't want salt, don't eat the skin.

I used brown sugar and will try Tamari sauce instead of soy next time.

   4      tablespoons   cumin
   4      tablespoons   thyme
   4      tablespoons   garlic powder
   4      tablespoons   black pepper -- freshly ground

   2      tablespoons   curry powder
   1      tablespoon    onion powder
   1      tablespoon    MSG or other flavor enhancer -- (optional)

In a small bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine all the ingredients.  Stir or shake to mix.  Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place for several months.

This rub is pretty strong and so I do not recommend it for thin cuts (like ribs).  Bit it is swell on heavier cuts of meat such as beef round, prime rib, pork shoulders, and even the whole hog.  With this recipes, you have enough for five shoulders or four hams.  Best if you let the meat marinate, loosely covered, in the refrigerator for a good twenty-four to forty-eight hours after being rubbed.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        pork loin back ribs
                        ***DRY RUB***
   4      tablespoons   paprika
   2      teaspoons     salt
   2      teaspoons     onion powder
   2      teaspoons     pepper, black
   2      teaspoons     pepper, white
   2      teaspoons     pepper, red
                        ***BARBEQUE SAUCE***
   6      tablespoons   salt
   6      tablespoons   pepper, black
   6      tablespoons   chili powder
   4      cups          ketchup
   4      cups          vinegar, white
   4      cups          water
   1      each          onion, large, yellow, diced
     1/2  cup           molasses, sorghum

Barbeque Sauce: Combine ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil, reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 10 minutes or so. Pour into sterilized canning jars, seal and let stand 2 to 6 weeks before use. (If you are like me, not much chance of this happening, but it is a nice touch to the recipe - CWS)

Dry Rub: Mix ingredients together thoroughly.

Preparation: Sprinkle dry rub liberally on ribs. Allow ribs to stand 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature until the rub appears wet. Prepare a smoker for long, slow (230F) indirect cooking, using hickory chips or other hardwood chips for extra flavor. Cook ribs, bone side down, for 2 hours at 230F in a smoker using indirect heat. Turn and cook 2 more hours. Turn and cook one more hour. During the last 15 minutes, baste with barbeque sauce diluted by half with water. Serve ribs with warmed, undiluted sauce on the side.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      pounds        ground beef
   3      medium        onions -- finely chopped
   1      large         bell pepper -- finely chopped
   3      teaspoons     minced garlic
   1      tablespoon    salt
   1      teaspoon      ground cayenne pepper
   1      teaspoon      paprika
   2      teaspoons     oregano
   2      tablespoons   cumin
     1/3  cup           chili powder
  24      ounces        tomato sauce

In a large pot (preferably cast iron) brown ground beef.  Lightly sprinkle salt on meat (does not include TBS above).  Halfway through browning, add garlic, chopped onions, and bell pepper.  Note: Never add garlic until there is some liquid in the pot.  Onions will be almost clear when browning is complete. Drain the meat.  Add salt, red pepper, paprika, oregano, cumin, chili powder, and tomato sauce.  Let simmer for three to five hours at a low temperature.  A crock pot works great. 
I do just like Justin Wilson does, "stirs da pot after each ingredient is added."

You can cheat and eat after about 30 minutes, but it is better after it simmers for a while.

If it don't taste good, you didn't do it right! Try again!

This is not healthy chili--it's good chili!

   1      teaspoon      cumin seeds

   1      tablespoon    chopped lemon grass
   2      tablespoons   chopped shallots
   1      tablespoon    chopped garlic

Place the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan without adding any oil. Dry fry them, stirring, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted aroma.  Grind the toasted seeds in a spice grinder.

Pound all the ingredients together with a little water to produce a medium thick paste.

You can pound the spice mix in a mortar and pestle or you can use a mini-food processor. Make a lot of the paste and save it for use in other curries.  Store paste in the refrigerator.

   4      cups          cider vinegar
     1/4  cup           honey -- (1/4 to 1/2)
     1/4  cup           cheap yellow prepared mustard -- (NOT Dijon)

   4      teaspoons     salt
   2      teaspoons     ground black pepper -- (coarse)
   4      teaspoons     red hot pepper flakes -- pulverized

Heat all in a sauce pan on low for approx.  30 min, whisking while heating.  The honey and mustard I start with a 1/4 cup and than just add by taste.  It usually ends up somewhere less than 1/2 a cup.  The pepper flakes are the kind you would sprinkle on pizza.  I smash them so  piece doesn't get stuck in a judges teeth and starts to burn.  I use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of finished sauce to a 6 lb.  pulled butt.

Young Whole Pig (this is after "First catch a pig and remove bristles after killing it")

"Place over the fire so the heat will strike the back first.  Keep far
enough from fire so the skin does not blister or crack.  Baste often with cooking oil to which has been added chopped garlic..

When the pig appears to be thoroughly heated on the back turn over and start cooking the under side, basting often.  It is advisable to turn the pig frequently.  The cooking period usually is about one and half hours, but great care must be taken that all parts are thoroughly done.  When the meat starts breaking away from the bones it is easy to tell that the pig is ready to serve." (p.23)

The old timers were not in error in their discussions about distance from the fire!  That was one of the few variables they could look to.  The others were time and "coals".

"One of the most important points to remember is the condition of the coals at the moment of placing the meat over the fire.  This mystic moment arrives when the white ashes are starting to fall from the red glowing coals and the whole bed is beginning to turn gray.

Any attempt to begin cooking before this time has arrived means that the meat probably will be scorched or unduly dried out." (p.11)

Bill Magee advises "Do not forget or allow yourself to be distracted either by women or liquor - at least until the meat is done."

Working in batches, transfer the soupy mess to a food processor or blender and process until its chopped to a coarse sticky paste.  You may freeze the sauce at this stage, as it freezes beautifully.  Smear thickly on chicken of fish, let marinate in the refrigerator as long as possible, at least over overnight, before roasting, broiling or BBQing.  Basting occasionally during the cooking.  Covers 3-4 chickens.

Squeeze the juice from the fruit into a large jar like the type you make sun tea in. Toss in the peels. Add the sugar, and fill with crushed ice. Add the whole fifth of tequila, put the lid on and shake well.

While sitting around the campfire one evening some friends introduced us to yucca. When the jar gets passed to you, you give it a shake, twist off the lid and have a gulp. There is a ritual that goes with it. If you don't shake it first you loose a turn. If you take too small of a drink, you must drink more until everyone is satisfied that you didn't cheat yourself. If you take too big of a drink, you have to buy the tequila for the yucca jar for the next evenings campfire. Kinda like the dumb things we did in college, but sitting around the campfire kinda brings out a different person than when you're at home and have to be responsible. Gives you a chance to loosen up. And it tastes great!

                        ground black pepper

Put beef and fowl into water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added for each quart.  (there should be a little more water than enough to cover the meat.  Needless to say, you'll need a mammoth kettle; we use our two largest ones.)  Bring to a boil, then cook very slowly, covered, until beef and fowl are tender.  Remove meat from cooking broth, cool, then cut both beef and fowl into bit-size pieces.  Return meat (without bones) to broth, bring to a boil, and add vegetables in order given.  When liquid comes to a full rolling boil again, add rosemary and pepper; lower heat; cook slowly until all vegetables are done (about 45 minutes).  Add salt to taste.

The burgoo was ladled into tin cups as the famishing horde circled the steaming caldron.  Corn bread squares, hush puppies or corn dodgers were served with this one-dish meal which was eaten with a spoon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      tablespoons   black peppercorns
   3      tablespoons   cumin seed
   2      tablespoons   turmeric
   1      tablespoon    ground cardamom
   1      tablespoon    ground coriander

Grind all the ingredients together with a mortar and pestle or in a spice grinder. Store in an airtight container.

Rub this spice blend devised by Zvia, an Afghan street vendor in New York, all over beef, pork, or chicken 2 hours prior to grilling. It also adds a pungent flavor to tuna, swordfish, bluefish, and bass; rub it on both sides of the steak or fillets about an hour before grilling. In both cases, the rub can be left on the meat or fish while grilling to make a blackened seasoned crust. It can also be stirred into boiled rice or summer soups to taste. Makes about 1/3 cup.
