In a small bowl dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of warm water. Set aside. In a small saucepan place 1 1/2 cups of water, shortening and honey. Heat until shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm. Place honey mixture in a large mixing bowl and stir in dissolved yeast. Sift together the 1/4 cup mesquite meal, flours and salt. Add 1 cup of the flour mixture to the honey mixture. Beat well. Gradually stir in the remaining flour a little at a time, beating well after each addition. The final cup will have to be kneaded in. Knead for ten minutes on a lightly floured surface. Dough should be smooth, stiff, bit pliable.

Place dough back in bowl and brush with 1 tablespoon oil. Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in a draft-free place until dough doubles in bulk, usually about one hour. Punch down the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead again for five minutes. Divide the dough in half and place in 2 greased baking bowls, or shape into 2 round loaves and place on a greased baking sheet. Brush tops with remaining oil and sprinkle each with one tablespoon of mesquite meal. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned and loaves sound hollow when tapped.

Note: This recipe works well with bread machines. Follow manufacturer's directions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2              C  Stonge Ground Seven Grain Hot Cereal -- Note
  2                  C  Boiling Water
     1/2             C  Pale Amber Honey -- Or
                        Wildflower Honey
  2               Tbsp  Instant Yeast
  2                Tsp  Salt
  1                  C  Warm Water
  4                  C  Bread Flour
                        (NOTE:  I ended up using about 6 cups)

I made this yesterday and we had it toasted this morning.  It is very good.

NOTE: including cracked wheat, flaxseed, oats, and other cracked grains) (NOTE:  I used Kashi - The Breakfast Pilaf and added flaxseed.  It is not stone-ground, but it worked well

Put the cereal into a medium bowl, pour the boiling water over it, and set aside to soften for 15 minutes.

In the bowl of an electric mixer or another large bowl, stir together the honey, yeast, salt, and warm water with a wooden spoon.

Using the paddle attachment or the spoon, beat in 3 cups of the bread flour, then beat in the softened grains, with their liquid until you have a moist, soft,heavy dough.

Switch to the dough hook and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, adding about 1 cup more flour (NOTE:  I found it needed about 3 more cups), until the dough is elastic and no longer sticky.  Or turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand.

Place the dough in large oiled bowl and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Grease two 9x5-3-inch loaf pans or a large baking sheet and set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Knead it a few times.

Divide the dough in half.  Shape each portion into a regular or round loaf and put in the prepared loaf pans or on the baking sheet.

Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  (NOTE: Watch it after 30 minutes.  It rose very fast for me)

Preheat the oven to 375F.  Bake the bread for 40 minutes (NOTE:  It took only 35 minutes for me, so check it at about 30 minutes) or until the loaves are a rich brown on top and sound hollow when when tapped on the bottom (NOTE:  I sure don't sound hollow when I'm tapped on the bottom); an instant-read thermometer should register 190F to 200F.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Makes 2 regular or round loaves.

This recipe appeared in my local newspaper and is from Judith Fertig's "Prairie Home Breads:  150 Splendid Recipes from America's Breadbasket" (Harvard Common Press, $18.95)  Any good stone-ground, seven-grain cereal will work well in this bread recipe, Fertig says.  "Cooking the grains to soften them before adding them to the dough is an ancient technique that works well today."

  1                Tsp  Cold Water

(Makes ten 4-inch bagels)

My secret for the beautiful golden color on the outside of bagels is to add some baking soda to the water in which they boil. If you've never made bagels, be prepared to spend some time shaping the dough, or just prepare your family for the fact that these bagels will taste great even if they're not perfectly formed on your first attempt.

These bagels are adapted from a recipe by Lauren Groveman in "Baking With Julia" (William Morrow, 1996).

Place the yeast in a large bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the water. (If using active dry yeast, increase the temperature of the water to 110 F.) Stir until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside in a draft-free place until it is covered with bubbles, 10 to 20 minutes. (If there are no bubbles, the yeast is too old to be useful.) Add the remaining sugar and water and the shortening and pepper and mix gently. Using a wooden spoon, add the flour 1 cup at a time to the yeast mixture and mix until you have added a total of 3 cups flour. Sprinkle the mixture with the salt and stir to combine. Continue to add the flour, 1 cup at a time, until you have added a total of 5 cups flour and a soft, sticky dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough, adding as much of the remaining 1 cup flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the surface, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. If you prefer a heavier, chewier bagel, add a little extra flour.

Coat the inside of a 4-quart container with half of the oil or butter. Press the dough into the container and coat the top of the dough with the remaining oil or butter. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours (the dough will rise more slowly in a cold room). Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (may refrigerate for up to 2 days).

At least 30 minutes before baking, adjust the oven racks to the lowest and second lowest positions. Place a heavy skillet or roasting pan on the lowest rack. Preheat the oven to 500 F. Lightly coat two baking sheets with the oil spray and dust them with cornmeal and, if desired, some of 1 or more of the optional toppings.

Place 2 clean towels and a lightly floured towel on a counter near the stove. Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil. Stir in the sugar or barley malt and baking soda.

Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half; wrap 1 piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate it until you have finished with the first batch. Divide the other piece of dough into 5 pieces. As you work with 1 piece of dough, keep the remaining dough covered with a towel. Draw the sides of 1 piece of dough up, pinching the ends together at the top, to form a round ball. Turn the ball so the pinched seam is on the bottom. Stick your index finger into the center of the ball, all the way through to the bottom, to make a hole. Hook the hole onto the thumb of one hand and insert the index finger of your other hand into the hole and rotate and stretch the dough to form a hole about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. (The bagel should resemble a ring; it will puff up after boiling to resemble a typical bagel.) Place the bagel on the floured towel and cover it with a second towel. Repeat with the remaining 4 pieces of dough. (You should boil and bake these 5 bagels before shaping the remaining 5.

UPDATE: My father said that when shaped the way they did in the bakery they developed more chew so I tried it and he was right. Pretty good memory considering it's been over 50 years and he's now 87! I now shape them by rolling each piece into a rope, overlapping the ends by about 2-inches and then rolling on the overlap to make it adhere and be the same thickness as the rest.

Using a skimmer, transfer the bagels, 1 at a time, to the boiling water, working in batches of 2 or 3 at a time so that the bagels can swim around without touching each other. The bagels may sink at first but should rise to the surface. Boil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side, gently flipping them once with the skimmer. Using the skimmer, remove the bagels from the pot, shaking off excess water over the stockpot, and transfer the bagel to the second unfloured towel for 30 to 60 seconds. Using a spatula, transfer the cooled bagels to the prepared baking sheet after no more than 60 seconds so that they don't stick to the towel.

To glaze the bagels, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg whites and 1 teaspoon of the cold water until combined but not frothy. Strain the mixture, discarding the solids. Lightly brush the top of each bagel with the glaze; be careful not to let the glaze drip onto the baking sheet as it will glue the bagels to the surface. Lightly brush the top of each bagel with a second coat of glaze and, if desired, sprinkle with some of 1 or more of the optional toppings.

To bake the bagels, place 4 ice cubes in a bowl and add the remaining 1/4 cup of cold water. Pour the ice mixture into the roasting pan or skillet on the lowest oven rack and immediately place the sheet of bagels on the upper oven rack and quickly close the oven door to capture the steam produced by the ice. Immediately reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake the bagels for 25 minutes. Turn off the oven without opening the door and let the bagels sit for 5 minutes. Open the oven door and leave the bagels in the oven for 5 more minutes. Transfer the bagels to a wire rack and set aside to cool.

Repeat the shaping, boiling, glazing and baking with the remaining dough. The bagels keep well for 1 day at room temperature in a brown paper bag. May wrap in airtight plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to 1 month; thaw at room temperature.

* Note: Barley malt, also known as diastatic malt powder, is available locally at many grocery stores and by mail order from King Arthur's Flour (call 800-827-6836 or see www.kingarthurflour.com).

Flour your hands and lightly knead the cold dough; it will be very soft. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Brush botter of olive oil in baguette molds. Shape each piece into a 16-inch long sausage (adjust the length according to your baguette molds The dough will only half-fill each mold at this point. Clip the top every 1/2 inch with scissors. Brush olive oil over the top. Heat the oven to 150F (or warm) for 5 minutes. Turn off and place the bread molds in the turned-off oven for 30 minutes or until the dough fills the molds. Remove from the oven. Preheat the oven to 400F. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Unmold on a cake rack and wait 1/2 hour before serving.

This dough also works very well for pizza & pissaladiere.

I made the following bread a few days ago and it was very good and disappeared very fast.  Yum. Since there are only two of us, it works best to use recipes that make just one loaf, which this does.

Makes 1 loaf.

To make dough: In large bowl, combine 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and salt. Heat water and butter until very warm (120 to 130F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in whole wheat flour, banana, egg, pecans and enough remaining all-purpose flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

Divide dough into 3 equal pieces; form each into smooth ball. Place balls in greased 8 x 4-inch loaf pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

In small bowl, combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over top of dough. Bake at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.

  1                  C  Water -- Lukewarm
  2               Tbsp  Yeast
  2               Tbsp  Sugar -- Or
                        Honey Or Molasses

  2 1/2              C  Milk -- Lukewarm
  7                  C  Whole Wheat Flour
  1 1/2              C  Bean Flour
                        Any Kind You Have Around
  2               Tbsp  Salt
  2 1/2              C  White Flour

Here is my normal bean bread recipe. It makes about four loaves. The flour is approx, I usually don't count, but just watch how it looks and stop adding flour when the side of the mixer bowl is starting to clear. You could make this with only whole wheat flour too, but I still haven't mastered to get that right all the time. Kids aren't too fond of the bricks I sometimes get when trying :-) So the white flour garantuees a more kid-friendly loaf.

Add the yeast and the sugar to the water and let it get bubbly. While that is working, I usually get my wheat berries and mill the whole wheat flour. In this recipe, I just first mill the wheat berries, then turn my mill to the coarsest setting and mill a cup of beans, so the whole wheat and the bean flour end up together in the same canister. Labor saving :

Add the oil, eggs and milk to the mixture, then add the whole wheat flour , the bean flour, and salt. Mix it and then start adding the white flour, half a cup at a time. Now watch it and stop adding when the bowl clears. From that point, mix it 4 minutes with your mixer, or hand knead it for 4 minutes / rest 10 minutes / hand knead another 4 minutes.

Let it rise for an hour, punch it down, let it rise for half an hour. you can skip the second rising or both of those rising, but the bread will be a bit different structure. Is good for 'bread in a hurry' though)  Now shape it, put it in bread pans and put it in oven. Set timer for 45 minutes and check it. If it looks like it has risen enough, start baking, other wise give it another 15 minutes or so and check again.

Turn on the oven at 400F, bake it for 20 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350F for 15 minutes. So the bread starts in a cold oven.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                  C  Warm Water -- Very Warm
     2/3             C  Honey
     2/3             C  Canola Oil
  2               Tbsp  Salt
  3               Tbsp  Dough Enhancer
  2               Tbsp  Vital Gluten
  5                  C  Hard White Wheat
  3               Tbsp  Saf Yeast

Mill a canister of Hard White Winter Wheat. Mill 1/2 canister of Kamut Wheat

In a large mixer bowl, on speed #1, mix well for a few minutes.

Let this mixture rest in bowl with splash guard on for 20 minutes. Then add 4 cups KAMUT flour and keep adding more Hard White Wheat flour until the side begin to clear - knead for 8 minutes.

Take out of bowl onto oiled counter with oil on hands and let rest, covered for 30-45 minutes.  Preheat over to 350F. When rising is complete, place dough into pre-oiled breadpans, I use the 8 inch pans from Norpro.  Cover with a towel and let rise until the tops of the dough rise 1 inch above the sides of the pan.

Bake at 350F for 30-35 minutes, cool on cooling rack.

This makes six 8 inch loaves of bread, 1.5 pounds each.

I got these from a friend named Dot a while back.  Thought you might like to make them too.

She stated in her note:
Here are a couple of bread I have recently tried.  Both have turned out well.  I prefer the Round Crusty Loaf - it turned out exceptionally good.

I did this recipe 2 ways, the way it is entered and then a second time using 1 cup real buttermilk for the powdered buttermilk and water.  I really prefer the real buttermilk - there is a definite tast difference for the better.

     1/2             C  Preserved Citron

NOTE:  or 1 1/4 cup warm water plus 3 Tbsp powdered buttermilk

I experimented with adaptation of the Buttermilk Bread for ABM as the basic recipe and came up with a loaf of holiday bread that is scrumptious! Actually, it could be used for toast any time of the year. It is not particularly sweet as I made it, but very sugary fruits and more maple syrup would suit most any sweet tooth.

My adaptation:

If using fresh buttermilk, add to it hot water, salt, maple syrup. Stir to combine. Pour into ABM.

(If using powdered buttermilk, add salt and maple syrup to warm water and pour into ABM).

Combine bread flour, whole wheat flour, sourdough bread enhancer, powdered buttermilk (if using that option).

Spoon dry ingredients over wet ingredients in ABM.

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients; put yeast in the well. Sprinkle chopped nuts around the periphery of the dry ingredients. Set ABM for 2 lb. loaf, white bread, "add extras". Start machine. Put as many dried cranberries in the extras bin as will fit. When you hear the cranberries being deposited, open the lid of the ABM and add the rest of the cranberries and the citron. Close lid.

* Substitute any dried and/or preserved fruits.  Larger fruits, e.g., dates, figs, apricots should be chopped into smaller bits.

Note: I plan to add 1 tsp. ground cardamom to the dry ingredients next time I make this. If I were using raisins, I would add 1 or 2 tsp(s) cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I use a Breadman Ultimate ABM, and the loaf came out high, dense and chewy, and golden brown, as close to perfection as I can imagine it could get. It makes out-of-this-world toast!

Surprise! The filling tastes like apple pie, but it's baked in a bread.

Prep: 30 min.
Rise: 45 min.
Bake: 25 min.

Note 1: Crispin, Fuji, Granny Smith, Rome Beauty, Golden Delicious, Jonathan, or Winesap

1. In a small bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm water. In a large bowl beat the 1/2 cup margarine or butter, the granulated sugar, and salt with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until combined. Add 1 cup of the flour, the 1/2 cup milk, eggs, and dissolved yeast. Beat until well combined. Stir in the 3 cups remaining flour. Stir until dough is smooth. Place dough in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours.

2. For filling, in a medium mixing bowl stir together the brown sugar, the 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Add the apples. Toss to coat the fruit. Set aside.

3. Grease 2 baking sheets. Stir dough down. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Roll each half of the dough into a 12x9-inch rectangle. Carefully transfer each rectangle to a prepared baking sheet. Spread with the 1/4 cup margarine or butter. Spread the filling in a 3-inch-wide strip down the center of each rectangle to within 1 inch of the ends.

4. On the long sides, make 3-inch cuts from the edges toward center at 1-inch intervals. Starting at one end, alternately fold opposite strips of dough, at an angle, across the filling. Slightly press the ends in the center together to seal. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double (45 to 60 minutes).

5. Bake in a 350F oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Remove from oven.

6. In a mixing bowl combine powdered sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon milk or orange juice. Stir in additional milk or juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it reaches drizzling consistency. Drizzle over loaf. Serve warm.

Makes 2 loaves (22 servings).

Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare loaves as directed except do not drizzle with icing. Wrap cooled loaves tightly in foil. Freeze for up to one month. To serve, thaw wrapped loaves at room temperature. (Or, heat wrapped loaves in a 300F. oven about 20 minutes.) Drizzle with icing as directed.

  1         Tablespoon  molasses

  3 1/2           Cups  whole wheat flour
                        or
  2 5/8           Cups  Flour -- Unbleached
     7/8           Cup  wheat germ

These are GENERAL Guidelines for Making Bread

Sponge Yeast
a) Pour scalding milk or boiling water over honey to dissolve it.
b) cool liquid to lukewarm--110F
c) sprinkle yeast in and stir.
d) let it set 5 minutes till it has a light, spongy texture.   If it clumps or doesn't sponge  START AGAIN

Add oil, salt, and 1st portion of flour. Beat mixture with wooden spoon, 100 strokes

Add the remaining flour, stir. When the dough is stirred enough, it will come away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn the dough out on a lightly-floured board. With the palms of your hands pushing away from you, push the edges of the dough to the center as you knead. Knead until the dough has an elastic texture and no longer sticks to your hands

Rinse a big bowl with warm water. Dry and lightly oil it. Shape dough into a ball and place it in the bowl. Lightly oil the surface of the dough.

Cover the bowl with a warm, slightly -damp cloth, and set it in a warm place (about 85F). Be sure there are no drafts. Let the dough rise until it is doubled in balk, (about 1 - 2 hours)

Punch dough down, letting air escape and giving fresh air to yeast. Let dough rise a second time, and punch it down again when it is doubled.

For whole wheat bread it is best to let it rise yet a third time, and punch down again.

Shape loaves and place into buttered pans. The dough tends to stick more if oil is used. Cover pans with  warm damp cloths, and let rise in pans 20 to 30 minutes.

Pre-heat oven to 350F

Bake loaves until crust are browned and bread has pulled away from sides of pans about 50 to 60 minutes

Remove loaves from pans Immediately. Set the bread on racks to cool. yea right it does not get the chance to do that at my house  :

Stir down with wooden spoon, then add about 3 more cups of flour to form a moist dough that is firm enough to turn out onto a well-floured board.

3. Dip hands in flour and knead dough until smooth and nonsticky, adding additional flour as needed. The dough should be velvety-smooth.

4. Form into a ball and place in a well-buttered, warm mixing bowl. Turn ball of dough so that entire surface of dough is coated with softened butter. Cover and again place in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 hour.

5. Punch dough down, turn out onto a lightly floured board, and let rest for about 5 minutes.

6. Roll out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch cut with a floured knife first into approximate 2-inch squares, then into triangles. Roll up from wide side to point and place on baking sheet about 1/4 inch apart. When all are prepared, brush with melted butter and again let rise until about double in bulk, about 30 minutes.

7. Bake in a preheated 350F. oven until lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on size. To test for doneness gently tap top of roll for a hollow sound or break open one roll to see if it is sufficiently baked in the center.

Place bread ingredients, except the raisins, lemon peel, and walnuts or pecans, in the pan according to manufacturer's instructions. Set crust on medium and program for the basic cycle or sweet bread cycle; press start. (This recipe is not suitable for the delay cycle.) Dough ball will look dry at first and take about 7 minutes to smooth out. At the beep, add raisins, lemon peel, and walnuts.

In a small bowl, combine icing ingredients and whisk until smooth. Adjust consistency of glaze by adding more milk, a few drops at a time. I like this quite thick but still pourable.

When bread is done, remove it from pan and place hot loaf on a wire rack with a sheet of parchment or large plate underneath. Using an oversize spoon, drizzle or pour glaze in a back-and-forth motion over the top of the loaf. As the glaze cools, it will set. If you want a thicker layer of icing, wait 10 minutes after glazing, then do another layer.

Hi everybody,

today I send some recipes I've translated from German to English. I hope that everything is clear to understand and that you can get all ingredients. If you have a question please let me know.

Mona from Germany

This recipe is one of my familys favorites:

Dissolve yeast in water. Sieve flour in a bowl, add water, yeast, sugar, butter and salt and knead to a smooth dough. Divide into 8 pieces.

Roll to a string of 16-20 inches and shape a pretzel. You can also built rolls with the dough.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 10 minutes.

In the meantime bring the water to boil, add salt and cook the pretzels one after the other for 30 seconds. Remove from water, place them on a baking tray and sprinkle with salt (or poppy seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, whatever you like). Sprinkle salt on the pretzel immediately after removing from water. Store in a cool place for 30 minutes. Then bake in the preheated oven at 440F for 20 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Cups  Milk -- scalded
     1/2           Cup  Lard
  1         Tablespoon  Salt
  4               Cups  All-Purpose Flour

Add lard, salt and 2 cups flour to scalded milk and mix well over low heat. Remove from fire.

Sift 2 cups of flour on board, add warm dough and work in flour.  Knead well and cool.

This dough can be rolled immediately or kept in a cool place for a couple of days. May be stored in a plastic bag.

Make a small patty, about hamburger size, with even sealed edges as you would for pastry.  Flour board lightly and with a Scandinavian rolling pin roll patty in all directions, keeping the dough round.  Roll lightly, stretching dough until it is almost as large as the lefse baker.  Use pointed stick to handle dough when it is transferred from the board to the baker.  Brown lightly, prick air bubbles, turn and brown other side.  It may be necessary to change heat control from high to low.

This is a soft bread.

Serve with butter, or butter and sugar.

Note: I don't have either a Scandinavian rolling pin or a lefse baker, so I use a regular rolling pin and a griddle.  This is like a Swedish tortilla!  We usually spread butter and sprinkled sugar over the lefse then rolled them up and DEVOURED them!

  2 1/2            Tsp  Active Dry Yeast -- (Not Rapid-Rise)
                        Or 1 Tbsp Fresh Yeast
  3               Tbsp  Granulated Sugar
  3                  C  Warm Water -- (About 100F)
  6                  C  Bread Flour -- Plus
                        Additional For The Work Surface
  1               Tbsp  Barley Malt Syrup -- Or
                        Diastatic Malt Powder -- (Optional) *
  2                Tsp  Deli Rye Flour -- Optional
     1/4           Tsp  Citric Acid -- Optional
  2                  C  Rey Flour
     1/4             C  Caraway Seed
  1               Tbsp  Salt
  1               Tbsp  Vegetable Oil -- Plus
                        Additional For The Bowl
  2                Tsp  Cornmeal

This makes 1 very large loaf or 2 smaller ones.

Using fresh yeast will cause the bread to rise more quickly. Preheating the baking sheet makes the bread begin to rise immediately upon contact; this results in the bread holding its shape and attaining the highest rise.

Place the yeast in a small bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the water. (If using active dry yeast, increase the temperature of the water to 110F.) Stir until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside in a draft-free place until covered with bubbles, 10 to 20 minutes. (If there are no bubbles, the yeast is too old to be useful.

In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, 3 cups of the bread flour, 2 tablespoons of the remaining sugar, the remaining 2 3/4 cups water and the optional malt, deli rye flavor and citric acid, if using. Whisk until very smooth, about 100 strokes; set aside.

UPDATE: I no longer use the deli rye flavor. It suddenly seemed artificial and unncessary to me!

In a very large bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 cups of the bread flour, the rye flour, the remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar, the caraway seeds and salt. Gently scoop the flour mixture onto the reserved yeast mixture to form a blanket. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until the dough has risen considerably, 4 to 5 hours (may refrigerate for as long as overnight).

Add the oil to the dough and, using a wooden spoon, mix to combine, adding flour or water as needed to form a soft dough. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough, adding flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the surface, until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. The dough should jump back when pressed with a fingertip. Form the dough into a ball. Lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, turn to coat with the oil, cover tightly with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours (the dough will rise more slowly in a cold room).

Using your fist, punch the dough to deflate it. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough briefly. Form the dough into a ball, return it to the bowl, cover and set aside to rise a third time for 45 minutes. Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal.

To shape the dough, roll it into an 8-inch ball or 2 smaller balls and place the dough on the cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet. Cover with a large inverted bowl or plastic wrap that has been oiled. Set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 60 to 75 minutes.

A little more than halfway through the final rising, adjust the oven rack to the lowest position. Place a second baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 450F.

When the dough has risen, using a sharp knife, slash the top of the loaf twice in 1 direction about 6 inches apart, then slice again with 2 slashes perpendicular to the first set.

Carefully slide the dough directly onto the preheated baking sheet and bake the bread for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 400 F and continue to bake for 50 to 65 minutes (34 to 40 minutes for the 2 small breads), until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when lightly tapped.

Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool slightly. Baked bread stays warm for 2 hours after baking.

* Note: Barley malt, also known as diastatic malt powder, is available locally at many grocery stores or by mail order from King Arthur's Flour (call 800-827-6836 or see www.kingarthurflour.com). Deli rye flavor and citric acid (or "sour salt") is also available from King Arthur's Flour. Citric acid is available at some grocery stores.

I baked for years before kids both by hand and with my kitchenaid.  But I stopped after my second child was born - no sense of time, no tolerance for extra mess. Now I'm lazy and have two small kids and a very large dog, so I have given up on making bread outside the abm.  However, I've managed to stop buying bread at all by getting pounds and pounds of flour at a time from good old king arthur and when the delivery arrives, dh gets to be in charge of the kids while I package it all up as bread mixes.  I select 4 or 5 recipes, and make between 3-5 of each into mixes, including the name on the outside, and a small slip of paper inside with what still needs to be added [usually just liquid and yeast]  Those with cheese etc go in the freezer, the rest are stored in the cabinet.  Another big help is that I learned I could substitute 1 T water plus 1 T soy flour for each egg in the recipe - I can't detect a difference in the finished bread although someone here might be able to, but I use it in most of our breads and no one here is unhappy :).  I will say that it makes a big difference in cookies, although it's still very good.  I find they come out crisper and with a slightly nutty flavor - my mom likes it so much better she only eats cookies made that way now.  So now I don't have to worry about eggs in the mix and can use my timer setting without issues and wake up to fresh bread.

Now, here's a basic abm oatmeal bread that has become our favorite toast :

Put in your bread machine in the order listed and set for 1 1/2 lb. light or dark loaf, or remove and shape to bake in oven.

Here's a gift my son has made for his teachers for years now -- you could adapt almost any muffin or scone recipe you like.  Don't use the "wet" ingredients, provide instructions as to what's needed.  (If it's an applesauce recipe, you can include the snack-sized containers of applesauce so they don't have to go buy it!)  Mix the butter & "dry" ingredients in your food processor and put in a 1-quart zipper bag.  Put any "extras" (dried fruit, nuts, fancy sugar for the top) in smaller zipper bags.  Add seasonal paper muffin cups, put it all in a gift bag with the instructions, and give!

Blend all above ingredients in food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal.  transfer to 1-qt. zipper bag.

This is the recipe that I have used for years  to make Italian Christmas bread.  It is wonderful.

This is a bread machine recipe for traditional Italian fruit bread.  It comes from the DAK gourmet Gazette.  It works very well in the Breadman Ultimate Machine.

I use the 2.0 pound nut and fruit bread setting with a light crust .  Also I load the pine nuts into the dispensing tray and push the "Extra" button to have the nut dispenser open.  When the dispenser opens, about  8  minutes before the end of the kneading cycle, I  add the candied fruit.  Three minutes later I add the raisins.

The bread comes out of the machine very soft and needs to cool  on a rack for about 30 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        Tablespoons  active dry yeast -- or
                        or 2 (1/4-ounce) packages
  2               Cups  warm water
                        (about 110 F)
  2          Teaspoons  salt
  1         Tablespoon  finely minced garlic
  1         Tablespoon  finely chopped fresh rosemary
                        or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
     1/4           Cup  olive oil
  2               Cups  coarsely shredded raw potato
  1                Cup  finely shredded or grated Parmesan cheese
  6               Cups  unbleached flour -- (6 to 7)
                        Additional olive oil

In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften. Add salt, garlic, rosemary, olive oil, potato, cheese, and 3 cups flour. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.

Turn dough onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Place dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Turn dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Shape each half into a ball and place onto a well-greased baking sheet. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375F. Place a shallow pan on the bottom shelf of the oven. Just before baking, brush each loaf liberally with extra olive oil and cut a cross about 1/4-inch deep into the top. Place the bread in the oven and put 5 ice cubes into the pan on the bottom shelf. Close the door quickly to prevent steam from escaping. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaves reaches 190F. Immediately remove bread from baking sheet and cool on a rack.

  1               Tbsp  Vegetable Oil
     3/4             C  Warm Water

Here is a nice recipe from King Arthur Flour Company for you to try.  Would be wonderful when you have guests over for the holidays or to take to a party.

This pleasantly dense loaf can be sliced nice and thin, making it ideal for hors d'oeuvres or a smorgasbord.

KNEADING AND RISING: Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead the dough - by hand, mixer, or bread machine - just until smooth, about 10 minutes. (If you're using a bread machine, cancel the machine after 10 minutes of kneading.) Add additional water or flour if needed - the dough should be somewhat stiff, but should also be smooth and elastic. Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour, until slightly puffy, then turn it out onto a lightly greased work surface.

SHAPING AND BAKING: To make a "party" rye loaf (hors d'oeuvre-sized slices), shape the dough into a 12-inch log and place it seam-side down in a greased 12 1/4 x 2 3/4 x 2 1/2-inch party or cocktail rye loaf pan. Alternatively, shape the dough into a log, and place it in a standard 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cover the dough and let it rise for about 1 hour, or until it's just crowned over the rim of the pan (for the party loaf pan), or is just even with the rim of the standard pan.

Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until its internal temperature registers 190F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven; wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.

Yield: one party loaf, or one small standard loaf.

Put in bread machine as directed by the manufacturer.  I like to make the dough in the machine and finish raising in a warm place in a loaf pan  then bake at 375F in my oven.  I also like to put an egg wash on it and sprinkle sesame seeds on.  But it can be made right in the bread machine, of course.

NOTE:  Canadian A.P.  Tap once

I liked the simplicity and decided to throw the necessaries into my Zo and see how it went. At the same time, I decided to go for a true French Bread texture, so opted for a very slack dough and minimum kneading with no punch down. also added a little oil, mostly to enhance keeping quality.

PreHeat oven to 500F (or highest possible)

Set Zo as follows.
Preheat 9 min (or omit all together)
Knead   6 min.
Rise    1 hr.

Divide dough in two and gently roll and stretch to baton shape on a floured surface. Place in French Bread (double) pan. Slash if desired. Allow to rise in warm place for another hour. Place in oven and reduce heat to 350F. Spray oven with water after 10 minutes. Again after another ten. Bake 30 to 35 minutes until done.
-----------------------------------------------------------
This bread is excellent, large holes, great crumb, and wonderful crust. Better then many bought French batons, best I ever made. The two long batons disappeared with their accompaniment, cream of cauliflower soup in record time!

Try it either way, or both .. I'm sure you'll be pleased. Try as a Cuban bread, placing in cold oven and heating to 375F.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I use Canadian AP flour which more closely approximates French flour. Dough should be very slack and partially stick to the pan and kneading blades. Knead just enough for smooth dough to form. Do not punch down. Dough will depress enough on handling. I place pan on Pizza stone which I leave in my oven.

This could easily be made in a non-programmable machine removing the dough after six minutes or so of kneading. However I don't think one could successfully knead this dough using a single kneading blade, I think you would have to use a double bladed machine, else the dough would simply rotate. This dough is too sticky to knead by hand, really easy in an ABM however.

There are lots of recipes here in the UK and Ireland for potato breads and scones both oven and griddle baked, some are yeasted and some are not.  An Irish bread baking book I have contains lots of good potato recipes - here's one of my favourites, (slightly adapted):-

Mix the dry ingredients, rub in the butter. Add the mashed potato and mix well. Use enough buttermilk to make a soft dough. Knead lightly on a floured surface and roll out thickly. Cut into farls (a circle divided into thirds) or squares. Put onto a greased baking tray and bake at 220C (425F) for about 20 mins until risen and golden brown. Best eaten straight form the oven with butter!

  1 1/4             Lb  Baking Potatoes -- Russet
     1/2             C  Cold Milk
  1                Tsp  Sugar
  1               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast
  4                  C  All-Purpose Flour -- Unbleached
  1               Tbsp  Salt

This bread is made from mashed potatoes, and while I don't use leftovers, I suppose you could.   And, I usually form it into a baguette rather than press it into a pan.  It also works well for pizza dough or fougasse.  The recipe comes from Chez Nous by Lydie Marshall. (so I guess that makes it French rather than English!!  Nonetheless,  it is based on mashed potatoes & flour.

Makes 2 pounds dough

In a pan, cover the potatoes with cold salted water and bring to a boil. Partially cover and cook for 30 minutes or until tender.

Drain the potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup of potato water.  Add the cold milk to the hot potato water. Sprinkle the yeast & sugar over it and set aside in a warm place for 15 minutes.

Making Bread with a Heavy Duty Mixer:
Peel the hot potatoes and transfer to the bowl of a heavy-duty mix fitted with a flat paddle. Beat the potatoes until mashed. Wait for a few minutes until the potatoes are just warm.

Start beating the yeast mixture into the mashed potatoes. Mix the flour and salt together. Gradually beat in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time at first. In winter, the author stops adding flour after 2 cups, and waits 20 minutes before continuing to add the remaining flour. When the dough sticks to the beater and cleans the bowl, add the remaining flour tablespoon by tablespoon.

Making Bread by Hand Mash the hot potatoes in a ricer in a large mixing bowl. Wait a few minutes for the potatoes to cool.

With a wooden spoon, stir the yeast mixture into the mashed potatoes. Mix the flour and salt together. Gradually beat in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time. In winter, the author stops adding flour after 2 cups, and waits 20 minutes before adding the remaining flour.

Cover the bowl with a plastic bag. Let rise at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours in winter or 1 hour in summer.

Sprinkle flour on the risen dough and knead it for about 1 minute, adding more flour if necessary, especially during humid days, but remember the dough should be soft, much softer than for a classic bread dough. Refrigerate the dough covered with plastic wrap.

  1                  C  Self-Rising Flour -- 4 Oz
     1/2         Stick  Butter -- 2 Oz

Steam or boil the potatoes.  Mash them without using milk. Rub the butter into the flour.  Mix this well with the mashed potato and knead it into a flexible dough. Either roll the dough on a pastry board and cut it into rounds, or less wastefully, form it into several flat cakes with your hands. Melt a little butter in a hot frying pan or a griddle and put in the potato cakes.  Cook them on both sides until they are dry and golden brown.

Serve at once with softened butter.

                Hand Made                       Potatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2             Lb  Russet Potatoes -- (About 3)
  4                Tsp  Salt
     1/2             C  Tepid Reserved Potato Water -- (85-90F)
  1               Tbsp  Active Dry Yeast
  2               Tbsp  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
  4 3/4              C  All-Purpose Flour -- Unbleached

Makes 2 loaves

A yeast-raised bread with a dough that's half flour, half mashed potatoes, and entirely satisfying. The crust is deep and dark, the moist crumb is tender and open here, tightly grained there, and the flavor is haunting and not easily placed, almost a little nutty. It is an odd and interesting dough to work with, a reverse dough-it comes together quickly and then softens and falls apart, defying what's expected of bread dough. The breads, two free-form rusticlooking loaves, each with a jagged, flour-encrusted crease running down its center, are easy to make and quick to rise-they proof for just twenty minutes before shaping and twenty minutes after, making them good candidates for baking on a whim.

Cooking the Potatoes:
Scrub the potatoes and cut them into quarters, peel and all. Toss them into a 2-quart pot, cover with water, add 2 teaspoons of the salt, and boil until the potatoes are soft enough to be pierced easily with the point of a knife. Dip a measuring cup into the pot and draw off /2 cup of the potato water; reserve. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then spread them out, either in the colander or on a cooling rack over a jelly-roll pan, and let them cool and air-dry for 20 to 30 minutes. It's important that the potatoes be dry before they're mashed.

Mixing the Dough:
When the potatoes are cool, stir the yeast into the reserved potato water if the water is no longer warm, heat it for a few seconds in a microwave oven-it should feel warm to the touch) and allow it to rest for 5 minutes; it will turn creamy Meanwhile, turn the cooled potatoes into the howl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mash them. With the mixer on low speed, add the dissolved yeast and the olive oil and mix until the liquids are incorporated into the potatoes. Replace the paddle with the dough hook and, still mixing on low speed, add the flour and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Mix on low speed for 2 to 3 min utes, then increase the speed to medium and mix for 11 minutes more. The dough will be firm at first and soft at the finish. At the start, it will look dry, so dry you'll think you're making a pie crust. But as the dough is worked, it will be transformed. It may even look like a brioche, cleaning the sides of the howl but pooling at the bottom. Have faith and keep beating.

First Rise:
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes, at which point the dough will have risen noticeably, although it may not have doubled. While the bread is proofing, position a rack in the bottom of the oven and fit it with a baking stone or quarry tiles, leaving a border of at least 1 inch all around. Preheat the oven to 375F Place a linen towel on a baking sheet, rub the towel with flour, and set aside; this will be the resting place for the bread's final rise. Rub a baker's peel or baking sheet with cornmeal or flour. Fill a spray bottle with water; set aside.

Shaping the Dough:
Turn the bread out onto a lightly floured surface and, using a dough scraper, cut the dough in half. To shape each half into a torpedo shape, first shape it into a ball and then flatten it into a disk. Starting at the end farthest from you, roll up the dough toward you. When you're on your last roll, stop and pull the free end of dough toward you, stretching it gently, and dust its edge with flour. Finish the roll and, if necessary, rock the loaf hack and forth a little to taper the ends and form a torpedo, or football.

Second Rise:
Place the loaves on the floured towel, seam side down, and cover them with the ends of the towel (or another towel). Let the breads rise at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Baking the Bread:
When you're ready to bake, spray the oven walls with water and immediately close the oven door to trap the steam. Turn the breads out, seam side up, onto the peel or baking sheet and transfer them to the oven. Spray the oven with water again and bake the loaves for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is very brown, the loaves sound hollow when thumped on the bottom, and, the most important test, the interior temperature measures 200F when an instant-read thermometer is plunged into the center (bottom) of the loaves. Remove the loaves from the oven and cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing. While you should wait for the bread to firm up in the cooling process, slathering this bread with butter while it's still warm is a great treat.

Storing:
The breads should he stored at room temperature. Once sliced, the bread should be turned cut side down on a cutting board; it will keep at room temperature for about 2 days. For longer storage, wrap the breads airtight and freeze them for up to a month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature.

Here is a recipe for a holiday bread that I made last year. I normally am not one to make sweet breads, but this was quite nice and everyone seemed to like it a lot.

PREP AND COOK TIME: About 50 minutes, plus at least 3 1/4 hours to rise and cool

NOTES: For many generations, bread baking has been a passion in Greg Mistell's family. He grew up making yeast breads with his father. In fact, he enjoyed the craft so much, he turned it into a career. He is owner, and frequently the head baker, of Delphina's and Pearl bakeries in Portland. This rich cardamom loaf, sold at Delphina's, is also a favorite that Mistell makes at home with his 10-year-old daughter, Alisen. "Shaping a six-strand braid is fun, and the results are prettier than a standard braid," Mistell notes.

Candied orange peel can be ordered from King Arthur Flour ($3.50 for 6 oz.; 800/827-6836 or www.kingarthurflour.com). Look for coarse sugar with baking ingredients in supermarkets or specialty food stores. If making up to 1 day ahead, cool loaf, wrap airtight, and store at room temperature; freeze to store longer. Reheat, sealed in foil and thawed, in a 325F oven until warm, 10 to 15 minutes.

MAKES: 1 loaf (3 lb.); 16 servings

1. In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/2 cup warm (110F) water. Let stand until yeast is soft, about 5 minutes. Crush cardamom seed on a hard surface with a flat-bottom glass. Add cardamom to bowl along with salt, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, orange peel, milk, 1/3 cup melted butter, and egg yolks; mix to blend. Add 5 cups flour and stir until moistened.

2. To knead with a dough hook, beat on medium speed until dough no longer feels sticky and pulls cleanly from bowl, 8 to 10 minutes. If dough is still sticky, beat in more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.

To knead by hand, scrape dough onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and no longer sticky, 10 to 15 minutes; add flour as required to prevent sticking. Return dough to bowl.

3. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until at least doubled in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Mix with dough hook or knead briefly on a lightly floured board to expel air.

4. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball, set slightly apart on a floured board, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest 15 minutes.

5. On an unfloured board, roll each ball under your palms to form a 16-inch rope. Place ropes parallel and slightly apart on a buttered 14- by 17-inch baking sheet. At 1 end, pinch ropes together. Gently lift each rope up and off the center of the baking sheet, laying ends parallel and over pan edges to make an inverted V with 3 legs on each side.

6. To form braid, cross your right arm over your left, then pick up the 2 outer dough ropes. Uncross arms, and in doing so, cross the dough ropes over each other near the pinched ends, and lay ropes parallel to the inner part of the V. Repeat to lift the next 2 outer ropes, cross them just below the preceding ropes, and lay parallel to the inner part of the V. Continue braiding to the ends of the ropes. Pinch braid ends together.

7. Cover braid loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until slightly puffy, 35 to 45 minutes. In a small bowl, beat egg to blend. Uncover braid and brush lightly with egg; save extra for other uses or discard. Sprinkle braid evenly with coarse sugar.

8. Bake in a 325F oven (300F in a convection oven) until bread is deep golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.

9. Slide a wide spatula under bread to release from pan, then gently slide loaf onto a rack. Let cool at least 45 minutes. Slice to serve warm or cool.

     2/3             C  Warm Water -- Plus
  1                Tsp  Lemon Juice -- To Boost The Yeast
  2                     Eggs
     1/2             C  Sour Cream
     1/4             C  Butter Or Margarine -- Melted
                        (Unsalted Butter Is Good)
  2               Tbsp  Sugar
     1/2           Tsp  Salt -- Note
  2               Tbsp  Instant Potato Flakes -- (To 3 Tbsp)
  2 1/2              C  All-Purpose Flour -- (To 3 C)
                        Unbleached
  1 1/2            Tsp  Yeast

NOTE:  (* use 1/2 tsp. salt per cup of flour, so I use 1 1/2 tsp. salt)

I got this recipe from another list and adapted it for the bread machine.  I will give both directions for bread machine and non-bread machine instructions.  These rolls are very light and fluffy; my family loves them!

Mix all ingredients in ABM pan according to manufacturer's directions.  Push dough cycle.

Allow to rise 1 1/2 hours.  I just leave the dough in the machine an extra 30 minutes.  I have the Breadman tr600.

Punch down.  Roll dough into balls and can place in greased muffin tins as I do, or bake on parchment paper.  Let rise about 45 minutes.  Sometimes I just let them rise 20 to 25 minutes.  They're fine.  Brush with egg/water wash or milk before baking.  Bake at 400F for 12 to 15 minutes or till done.

Makes 1 dozen.

Non-Bread Machine Method:

Soften yeast in warm water.  In medium bowl combine dry ingredients.  add liquids, making sure the melted butter is not too hot.  Add enough flour to make soft dough.  Knead till smooth and elastic--about 10 minutes.  Put dough in greased bowl and cover.  Allow to rise 1 1/2 hours.  Punch down.  Roll dough into balls and place in greased muffin tins or on parchment-lined baking sheet.  Brush with egg/water wash or milk.  Allow to rise again about 45 minutes.  I usually just let them rise 20 to 25 minutes.

Bake at 400F  12 to 15 minutes or till done.  Cool on wire rack.

Yield:  1 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                Pkg  Dry Yeast
     1/2             C  Water -- Warm
     1/2             C  Milk -- Scalded
     1/2             C  Sugar
  1                Tsp  Salt
  1 1/2              C  Butter -- Room Temp
                        (3 Sticks)
  2                     Eggs -- Room Temp
  6                  C  Flour
  2                Tsp  Ground Cardamom
     3/4             C  Raisins -- Seedless
                        Glaze:
  1                     Egg White -- Slightly Beaten
  2               Tbsp  Sugar

There is something undeniably hand-crafted in the appearance of a braided loaf, and this handsome plump bread, delicately seasoned with cardamom and dotted throughout with raisins, achieves the look with only a few twists.  It is a rich bread--three sticks of butter in less than four pounds of dough.  It keeps well, toasts beautifully (but must be watched), freezes well and overall, is a whilly satisfying baking experience.

Baking sheet: large baking sheet, greased or Teflon

Preparation - 15 minutes

In a small bowl or cup sprinkle yeast over water.  Beat briskly with whisk or fork until the granules are dissolved.

In a mixing bowl pour milk over sugar, salt and butter.  Stir to soften butter.  When the liquid has cooled to lukewarm add yeast mixture, eggs, 3 cups of flour, cardamom and raisins.  With wooden spoon or electric mixer beat until smooth -- about 3 minutes.  Stir in additional flour, a cup at a time, first with the spoon and then by hand.  The dough will form a rough mass and clean the sides of the bowl.  It will not be sticky because of the large amount of shortening.   The dough should be firm but not stiff.

Kneading:  8 minutes

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, counter top or bread board.  With a strong push-turn-fold action, knead until it is smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes with the dough hook).

First Rising:  1 hour

Return the dough to the bowl (which does not need to be greased because of the high butter content of the dough).  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put the bowl in a warm place (80-85F) until dough has doubled in volume.

Shaping:  20 minutes

Punch down, turn out on a floured surface.  Knead briefly to work out the air bubbles.  Divide the dough into two pieces.  Reserve one.  Cut the other into 3 equal parts and roll each under the palms into a fat roll about 12 inches long.  Braid these loosely, with no more than 5 or 6 twists. Pinch the ends closed. Place the braid on the baking sheets.  Repeat with the reserved dough.

Second rising:  50 minutes

Cover with wax paper and return to the warm place until doubled in bulk.

Baking: 350F for 45 minutes

Preheat oven to 350F.  Before baking brush with the slightly beaten egg white mixed with sugar.  Bake in the oven until the loaves test done.  The crust will be a rich brown and a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean and dry.

Remove bread from the oven.  Use a metal spatula to lift the braid off the baking sheet because the hot loaf is somewhat fragile and might bread or bend. Cool on a metalrack before serving.

  1                Env  Yeast
     1/4             C  Water -- Lukewarm
  1               Tbsp  Light Brown Sugar
  1 1/2              C  White Flour -- Unsifted
  1                Tsp  Salt

  1                Tsp  Fennel -- Powdered
  1                     Orange Rind -- Grated

  1 1/2              C  Beer

  1               Tbsp  Butter
  2                  C  Rye Flour

I don't have a recipe for Svenskt Julbrod, but do have two recipes from Our Daily Bread by Stella Standard published in 1970 -one is Swedish Christmas Limpor Bread and the other is a Norwegian Christmas Bread.

Combine the yeast, water and sugar and let stand in a small-bowl until frothy.  Put the white flour in a large mixing bowl and add the salt, aniseed, fennel, orange rind and molasses.  Heat the beer (ale or stout) in a saucepan to lukewarm and melt the butter in it, then make a well in the flour mixture and pour it in.  Before mixing add the yeast and then beat it well.  Set the bowl in a dispan of quite hot water, cover and let the dough rise for 45 minutes to an hour.  Add the rye flour and beat very hard; it should be a light elastic dough.  If necessary add a spon or so of lukewarm water.  Beat for 4 or 5 minutes then set in a pan of water agin, cover and let rise until double in bulk.  Beat the dough down well, then put it in a greased brad pan, set in warm water, cover loosely and let rise 1 hour or more.  Put the pan in a cold oven.  Set it at 375F and bake the bread 15 minutes; reduce the heat to 325F and bake 30 minutes more.  This bread has a fascinating flavor.

About milk: with additional water)- .  I preferred, however, to just add small amounts of water until the machine wasn't having a problem mixing. ( see note below )*

( mix in machine/bake in oven )

By intending to do this loaf fully on the machine, I set it on Basic White, which would have been 3 hrs., 50 minutes.  However, I changed my mind when the beeper went for adding any extra ingredients. Forgot to mention one important item when mixing the bread in the machine, and that is:

* I had to add small amounts of water a couple of times, as my machine was getting bogged down with the mixing., meaning it might have been wiser for me to have made the water ingredient 3/4 of a cup, or a little more, instead of 2/3rds.  It took those two water adjustments to give it that smooth, sleek look.

Took it out, greased a large bowl, put it in the oven with oven light on & damp tea towel covering, and let it rise for 2 hours.  It doubled in size, so I punched it down, divided into 2 loaves and placed in greased loaf pans to rise again, which only took a little over an hour.  I did not spray water in the oven, or any of the other suggestions on the web for sourdough bread, nor did I slash the two loaves.

I baked them at 375F for 30 minutes and, Joan, they are wonderful. Not like all the other loaves I tried, either in the machine or even the round one baked in the oven that actually looked like a San Francisco loaf. They are very crusty on the outside, but beautiful and soft inside, and I'm getting fatter.

The aroma is breathtaking.  It's so strange, because when I set up Carl's starter in the first couple of days, I didn't like the stale or dead or (as my DH said) wall plaster aroma.  Boy, give me that aroma all the time, if it turns out bread like this.

Next time (being braver), I will leave out the yeast; it  ( dough ) will no doubt take much longer to rise, but that's okay.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        Tablespoons  active dry yeast
                        or 2 (1/4-ounce) packages
     1/2           Cup  warm water
                        (about 110 F)
  1 1/2           Cups  warm milk
                        (about 110 F)
     1/2           Cup  vegetable shortening
     1/2           Cup  honey
  3              Large  eggs
  1         Tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          Teaspoons  salt
  3        Tablespoons  soy flour -- (optional)
  5 1/2           Cups  whole wheat flour -- (5 1/2 to 6 1/2)
     1/4           Cup  melted butter
  1                Cup  firmly packed brown sugar
  3        Tablespoons  cinnamon
     1/2           Cup  raisins -- (optional)
     1/2           Cup  chopped nuts -- (optional)
  2               Cups  powdered sugar
  1         Tablespoon  rum extract
  5        Tablespoons  heavy cream -- (5 to 7)

In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften. Add milk, shortening, honey, eggs, lemon juice, salt, soy flour, and 2 cups whole wheat flour. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.

Turn dough onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Place dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Turn dough onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Roll each half with a rolling pin into a 12 by 18-inch rectangle. Brush dough with melted butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border along one long side of the rectangle free of butter.

Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts. Sprinkle evenly over each portion of dough. Roll up into 2 (18-inch) cylinders and pinch the loose edge to the cylinder. Cut into 30 rolls (15 from each cylinder) and place cut-side up into 2 parchment-lined 9 by 13-inch pans. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375F (350 if using glass pans). Bake for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the rolls reaches 190F. Leave the rolls in the pan to cool since they benefit from the steam - it makes them softer. Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes.

Combine powdered sugar, rum extract, and milk. Mixture should be the consistency of honey (if it isn't, adjust by adding more cream to thin it or powdered sugar to thicken it). Drizzle over the top of the rolls.

  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
     1/2             C  Warm Water
  1                  C  Stout -- Or
                        Wort

     1/3           Tsp  Grated Orange Peel
  2                 Oz  Butter
     1/4             C  Dark Corn Syrup
     1/2          Tbsp  Ginger
     1/2          Tbsp  Cloves
  2                  C  All-Purpose Flour -- Sifted

This is a classic Swedish Christmas bread used for the traditional Dip (or dopp i grytan). Slices of wort limpa are immersed in hot bouillon, then enjoyed steaming hot with ham or sausage.

Wort can sometimes be obtained from large breweries, otherwise stout or porter is a good substitute.

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Heat the wort until tepid and add to the yeast together with the salt, rye flour, and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Mix well. Cover and leave to rise for one hour.

In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in the syrup and spices, cool until lukewarm and add to the dough together with the orange zest. Gradually stir in the all- purpose flour. Cover and let rise for 1/2 hour.

Turn the dough onto lightly floured surface and knead well until smooth. Shape the dough into a 30 cm (12 inch) loaf and place on baking sheet. Cover and let rise until double. Prick the top of the bread with a fork and bake in pre-heated 175C (350F) oven for 35 to 45 minutes. A knock on the bottom of the bread should produce a hollow sound. Brush the top of the limpa with wort or stout. Wrap the bread in terry towels and let cool on rack.

Makes one loaf.

  1                     Yeast Cake
     1/2             C  Milk -- Cooled
  2               Tbsp  Sugar

Here is a zweiback recipe that is quite similar to Dutch rusk.

Zweiback (twice-baked Bread) is toast par excellence and enjoys a wide popularity. The second baking changes some of the starch to dextrine, which promotes ease of digestion.

Dissove yeast and sugar in lukewarm milk. Add three-fourths cup of flour and beat thoroughly. Cover and set aside, in a moderately warm place, to rise for fifty minutes.

Add lard or butter, eggs well beaten, enough flour to make a dough.  Add the salt and knead well.

Shape into two rolls one and one-half inches thick and fifteen inches long. Let rise for about one and one-half hours. Bake twelve minutes in a hot oven. When cool cut diagonally into one-half inch slices. Place on baking sheet and brown in a moderately hot oven. It is better when the second baking is done twenty-four hours after the first, though it may be done sooner if desired.
