  1                cup  milk -- skim okay
  4        tablespoons  dark brown sugar

*ABM Italian sliced thick works well.

Beat eggs lightly; add other ingredients except bread and beat well.

Soak bread slices in mixture and cook on grill or skillet. The brown sugar tends to caramelize which adds excellent flavor but be careful not to scorch. Good with bread cut into sticks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried apricots
  1                cup  flour
  2                tsp  baking powder
     1/4           tsp  baking soda
     1/2           tsp  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  1               Tbsp  grated orange peel
  1               Tbsp  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  1                cup  coarsely chopped walnuts

(makes 4 to 6 servings)

Place the apricots on a chopping block. Sprinkle 1 T flour over them. Dip a knife into the flour and chop the apricots finely. Flour the knife often to keep the cut up fruit from sticking together. Sift the remaining flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar into a large bowl. Combine the milk, egg, orange peel, and oil. Stir the flour mixture and the whole wheat flour. Fold in the cut up apricots, any flour left on the cutting block and the walnuts. Pour into a well greased, floured baking unit. Cover and place on a rack in the slow cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

Now before you all ask what a baking unit is (I wondered as I sat and typed this in), I looked it up in the front of the bread section. She says that some manufacturers are making units for slow cookers, but if you don't have one, a 2 pound coffee can works. Pyrex muffin cups also work. Also 1, 1 1/2 and 2 quart molds work.

Do not lift the lid while baking this bread.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             Slices  Bacon
     3/4           Cup  water -- (3/4 to 7/8)
  1                     Egg
  1         Tablespoon  Reserved Bacon Drippings
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  Sugar

4.After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           Cups  Water
  1           Teaspoon  Lemon Juice

  3               Cups  Bread Flour
  2        Tablespoons  Rye Flour
  2 1/4      Teaspoons  Active Dry Yeast

Select dough cycle. When complete, punch dough down by starting bread machine, let stir a few seconds, then stop machine. Place on floured work surface and let rest five minutes. Divide into two balls. Roll each into 10x6 rectangle. Fold dough in half lengthwise, then fold again. Pinch seams together. Place seam side down on baker's peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cut top of loaf with 1/4" deep diagonal slashes at 2" intervals.
Cover and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven and baking stone to 450=B0F. Sprinkle stone with cornmeal. Transfer dough from peel to stone. Bake for 22-28 minutes. Create steam for a crispy crust. NOTE : If using a baking sheet, rather than a baking stone, sprinkle with cornmeal before placing dough on pan, then cover and let rise. =20

NOTES : This recipe is from THE ULTIMATE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK by Tom Lacalamita. I noticed in an earlier post, a comment about using lemon juice. Many of the recipes in his book call for lemon juice, I think it really makes a difference. I often add it to my recipes. Also, don't omit the rye flour. Although it's a small amount, the rye lends a wonderful texture to the bread. This is excellent bread...with or without a banneton!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3            cup  water
  2         tablespoon  Baileys' Irish Cream
                        ---
  3                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                pkg  yeast
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
  1                cup  quick oats
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Combine dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Let rise 1 hr. Put dough into a loaf pan which has been wiped with canola oil and floured.
The dough will be very elastic. Push it into the corners of the pan with wooden spoon; let it rise 10 minutes more. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes or until done.

I let this rise in the microwave after heating some water in there. It is still a fairly low-rise bread, even though I substituted brown sugar for the yeast-inhibiting honey. It doubled in size from beginning to end, and it was delicious. I added a bit more water because my dough was a little dry. I also cut the salt a bit to make it lower in sodium. I really didn't knead this, just mixed it well with a wooden spoon. I don't think it will be necessary to do it any differently, since it was so good!

Sift flour, baking powder, and salt. Rub in fat. Add dry ingredients to make a soft dough.
Knead lightly, with floured hands, if needed. Break off pieces and roll into balls. Flatten to 1/2 in thick. Fry in hot oil or bake on a hot greased tawa.

NOTES : A tawa is a flat heavy aluminum griddle East Indians use here to make
things like roti.
I recently got a cast iron griddle to do the job.

 When I leave to rise for the second time, it should be left until they are almost doubled in bulk, but not quite. The time depends on how hot and humid it is. An easy test is to take a small ball of dough and drop in a glass of room temperature water, when it floats to the top, it's ready. It will probably take longer than 15 min in a cold place.

NOTES : Here is a recipe that is really quick and easy and DELICIOUS! I didn't even get more than a little chunk it went so fast.It does not contain yeast and used all purpose flour and only takes a little over an hour to make (quick bread cycle) - so it is a good recipe to have around when you run out of bread flour or yeast but are still craving a loaf. The recipe book says to usually add yeast first and liquid last but in this case they say to do the opposite (liquid first)

NOTES : We wanted to come up with a bread that tasted much like a banana quick bread.....something with a lot of banana flavor. This is what we came up with.

You'll be proud of this bread because it's beautifully shaped and luscious tasting. Each slice is moist and bursting with banana flavor.

Be sure and use VERY ripe bananas. This is a very moist dough, more so than most. But if the bread doesn't bake up high enough, next time add the extra water listed as optional in the recipe.

  2                     extra large eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  dairy sour cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        When beep sounds add:
     2/3          cup.  mashed banana
     1/3          cup.  chopped pecans

Into baking pan measure flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, and salt. Add oil, eggs, sour cream, and vanilla. Insert pan securely into unit; close lid. Select "CAKE" setting; press "START". When beep sounds after about 5 minutes, add mashed banana and nuts. Press "START" again. The "COMPLETE" light will flash when cake is done.

Remove from pan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 3/4           cups  unsifted flour -- (5 3/4 to 6 3/4)
     1/3           cup  instant nonfat dry milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast
     1/3           cup  margarine
  2               cups  very warm tap water (120 to 130 degrees F)

In a large bowl thoroughly mix 2 cups flour, dry milk solids, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast. Add margarine

Gradually add tap water to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 3/4 cup flour. Beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. turn out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.

Punch dough down; let rise again until less than doubled, about 20 minutes.

Divide dough in half; cut each half into 10 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth round ball. Place on greased baking sheets about 2 inches apart; press to flatten. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Bake at 375 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes, or until done. Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire racks.

CHIVE BARBECUE BUNS: Prepare as recipe directs but add 1/4 cup chopped chives to dry ingredients. Brush while warm with melted margarine. BACON BARBECUE BUNS: Prepare as recipe directs but substitute 1/4 cup bacon fat for 1/3 cup margarine and add 1/2 pound bacon, crisply fried and crumbled, after the second beating. Brush while warm with melted margarine. SESAME SEED BARBECUE BUNS: Prepare as recipe directs but add 1/4 cup toasted sesame seed to dry ingredients. Before baking, brush buns with combined beaten egg white and 2 tablespoons water and sprinkle with additional sesame seed.

DILL BARBECUE BUNS: Prepare as recipe directs but add 2 tablespoons dill seed to dry ingredients. Brush while warm with melted margarine. CELERY SEED BARBECUE

BUNS: Prepare as recipe directs but add 2 1/2 teaspoons celery seed to dry ingredients. Brush while warm with melted margarine.

NOTES : This recipe isn't for Onion Buns, but if I wanted to make some I would just add 1 cup of chopped onion after adding the margarine. After the buns are formed I would add some chopped onion to the top of each. I've made this recipe many times in the past, but if I were making it the way I bake today, I would cut the margarine in half and then add a little more water to make up for the difference in liquid. I routinely cut the fat in half in all bread recipes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Barley -- Quick-Cooking
  3 3/4            cup  All-Purpose Flour -- To 4 C
  2                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  1                cup  Lowfat Cottage Cheese
  1                cup  Honey
     1/4           cup  Butter Or Margarine
  2                     Eggs
  2 1/2            cup  Rolled Oats -- Quick-Cooking

Cook barley according to package directions and drain well. In a large mixer bowl combine 2 cups of the all-purpose flour and the yeast.

Heat cottage cheese, honey, the 1/4 C margarine or butter, 1 C water and 1/12 t salt just until warm (120 - 130 deg F) and margarine is melted, stirring occasionally. Add to flour mixture. Add eggs and beat on low speed of an electric mixer for 1/2 min, scraping sides. Beat 3 min on HIGH speed. Using a spoon, stir in barley, whole wheat flour, 1/2 C of oats and as much remaining all-purpose flour as you can.

Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (8 - 10 min). Shape into a ball. Place in a greased bowl; turn to grease surface.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double (abt 1 1/4 hr).

Punch down and turn out onto a floured surface. Divide in half and shape into 2 balls. Cover; let rest 10 min. Shape each ball of dough into a loaf and place in 2 greased 9 x 5 x 3" loaf pans, or place each ball on a lightly greased baking sheet and flatten to a 7" circle. Lightly brush tops of loaves with water and sprinkle with additional quick-cooking oats. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double (45 - 60 min).

Bake in a 350 deg F oven for 35 - 40 min or until done. Cover with foil after 25 min to prevent over browning. Remove from pans; cool on a wire rack.

Makes 2 loaves (32 servings)

  3 1/2           Cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (3 1/2 to 4)
                        ---
  1 1/2           Cups  additional flour -- as needed

STEP 1:  DISSOLVING AND PROOFING THE YEAST

1/3 c. warm water
1 package (2 1/2 tsp.) dry yeast
- or 1 cake (0.6 oz.) compressed yeast
1 1/2 tsp. sugar

Yeast is a living thing, a fungus microorganism. If it is alive and healthy to begin with, and if is handled with care, it will feed on the flour in bread dough, multiplying rapidly and "breathing out" bubbles
of carbon dioxide gas as it grows. The gas bubbles lighten the dough and cause it to rise, much the same way that air causes a balloon to inflate. The first step of the Master Recipe is to dissolve the yeast in water, adding also a bit of sugar to feed
the yeast and get its growth started (to activate it.)

Measure 1/3 c. of warm water into fairly deep, steep-sided 3- to 4-quart
mixing bowl. "Warm," in this context, means a temperature just slightly higher than body temperature.

The reason that bread dough is made with warm ingredients and allowed to
rise in a warm place is that warmth speeds the reproduction of the yeast and therefore the rising of the dough. But if the
temperature gets too hot-and, to be absolutely safe, any temperature over 100F should be considered dangerously high, especially for compressed yeast-the yeast dies. Cold and cool temperatures, by contrast, only slow down the growth of the yeast, without killing it. Thus, if you doubt your ability to gauge temperatures, it is wiser to dissolve yeast in tepid water than in water that its too hot. The cause of nearly all ill fated bread-making ventures is yeast death brought on by the dissolving of the yeast in excessively warm water.

Once the water is measured into the bowl, sprinkle the dry yeast over it
or mash the cake yeast into it with the back of the spoon. Stir in 1 1/2 tsp. sugar into the yeast mixture and set it aside in a slightly warm (not over 100F), draft free place (an unlit oven or a cupboard is ideal). After about 10 minutes you should see frothy bubbles around the edge of the bowl; they indicate that the yeast is indeed alive and "breathing". If not, give the yeast another 10 minutes-perhaps the room is cold and the yeast is slow to get going. If after 20 minutes there is still no sign of activity, the yeast is probably dead. Throw the mixture out and start again with fresh yeast.


STEP 2:  ADDING THE LIQUID AND SALT

Either 1 1/2 c. buttermilk
- or 1 c. yogurt
- (preferably made without gelatin or starch and thickeners)
 1/2 c. milk
2 1/2 tsp. salt
-  (2 tsp. if you're using buttermilk that contains added salt)

If the buttermilk (or yogurt plus milk) is cold, stir it over low heat until has warmed slightly. Remember that once again that body temperature is quite warm enough. (If the milk products are at room temperature, they need not be heated.) Pour the buttermilk or yogurt plus milk into the yeast mixture, add salt, and stir to
blend thoroughly.


STEP 3:  ADDING THE FLOUR

3 1/2 to 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (measure by scooping cup into large container of flour and sweeping off excess with the back of a knife.)

Add 2 c. of the flour to the yeast mixture and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon for a minute or two, or until the batter is smooth and elastic. Add 1 1/2 c. additional flour, reserving 1/2 c. for use during kneading (Step 4). Stir flour into the dough, being sure to incorporate all loose bits and flakes at the sides and bottom of the bowl. The dough will look lumpy and unmixed at this point. This is all right-it will smooth out when kneaded.

Using some of the reserved flour, lightly flour your work surface (be sure to give yourself enough room, at least a two-foot square), turn the dough out onto it, and lightly dust top of the dough with a bit additional flour. Let dough rest a minute or two to give it a chance to absorb the liquid ingredients.


STEP 4:  KNEADING THE DOUGH

The purpose of kneading is both to combine the ingredients in the dough and,
more crucially, to activate the flour's gluten molecules, which become resilient after a thorough kneading. Many people have the impression that kneading is hard to work but in fact you do not have to bear down hard on the dough as you work it. Furthermore, you can work at whatever pace suits you and stop whenever you want to rest.

Kneading consists of two motions. First, bear down on the dough with the heels of your hands, spreading it outward; then, gather up the outer edge of the dough with your fingertips and fold the dough in half again. Each time or every other time you perform these two movements, rotate the dough 45 degrees on the work surface. In the beginning the dough will be soft and sticky and you will have to sprinkle both it and your hands with small amounts of the reserved flour. Within a few minutes, however, the dough will feel smooth and will no longer adhere to your hands or to the work surface; at this point you should stop working in flour in if you have not yet used the entire 1/2 cup. The amount of flour the dough will absorb depends on the moisture content of the flour, the humidity of the day,a nd other factors. Too much flour can make the loaf heavy and dry.

How long you will have to knead the dough depends on how efficient your movements are. You can assume that it will take at least 10 minutes and perhaps as long as 15; if you are not an experienced
bread-maker, time yourself on a clock. When you are through, the dough will be elastic, smooth, and satiny, resembling very
thick taffy. It is better to knead much rather than too little; insufficiently kneaded dough will bake into a sticky, heavy, squat loaf with large holes.

Note: Recipe may be slowed at this point by refrigerating the dough.

                  ****

STEP 5: THE FIRST AND SECOND RISE

Form the dough into a ball. Place it in a clean, dry 3-to 4-quart bowl, and
cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the dough in a draft-free place where the temperature is between 80F and 90F. On a hot summer day, simply let the dough rise in a cool part of your kitchen (in a cupboard, for example); on a winter day, set the
dough in a draft-free spot that is several feet from the refrigerator. (Never set dough on the refrigerator or you will kill the
yeast.) Allow the dough to rise until it has slightly more than doubled in size and feels light and spongy when pressed with the fingers. This will take about 2 hours. Resist the temptation to cut the rise or to speed things up by placing the dough in a very warm place; if the rise is rushed, the baked bread will not have the proper texture and will have little flavor.

At this point you can proceed to form the loaf (next step), but your bread will be more flavorful and better textured if you let the dough rise a second time. Flatten the dough with your fist and reshape into a ball. return it to the bowl, cover, and let double a second time, which will take about an hour.

Note: Recipe may be slowed or temporarily arrested after the first rise by refrigerating or freezing the dough.


STEP 6: FORMING THE LOAF


1 tbs. soft butter or vegetable shortening

To produce an evenly textured, professional-looking loaf, you must shape
the raw bread rather than simply plopping it into the bread pan. I find the following method consistently reliable. ( The instructions given below are for a single large loaf, but the same general procedures apply to the forming of two smaller loaves.)

* Select either one 7 1/2-cup loaf pan measuring about 9 x 5 x 2 1/2 inches, or two smaller loaf pans with a capacity of 4 to 5 1/2 cups each. Grease the pans with soft butter or vegetable shortening and set aside.

* Invert bowl and let rise dough fall upside down onto an unfloured work
surface, pressing it lightly to deflate. (The work surface must be unfloured because if flour is incorporated into the dough during forming, the loaf may not stick together and may have gaps inside when baked.)

* Pat he dough into a rectangle about 6 inches wide and 8 inches long, with the short side facing you. Don't worry if the dough sticks to the work surface.

* Starting with the short side nearest you, roll the dough lengthwise into the tightest cylinder possible.

* The dough will widen when rolled, and interior layers may push out at the ends. Poke any protruding layers back into the cylinder, then bring the top layer of the loaf over the protruding folds to cover them.

* With the sides of your hand, lightly jab along the bottom of the cylinder, both at the ends and at the sides, to tuck the dough underneath and stretch the top of the loaf tightly. Give the dough a few light slaps, particularly at the sides to make sure that it is well stuck together; then press the sides of the loaf at he ends between your palms to make them taper slightly. When you are through, the loaf should resemble a mammoth grain of rice.

* Lift the formed loaf between your hands as place it, seam side down, in the center of the greased bread pan. If the loaf has been formed correctly, it will touch the ends of the pan, but not the sides. Don't worry if the loaf is slightly too long for the pan, and therefore wrinkles or crumples in the center: it will puff up as it rises.

Note: Recipe may be slowed or temporarily be arrested at this point by refrigerating or freezing the loaf.


STEP 7: FINAL RISE OF THE FORMED LOAF; PREHEATING THE OVEN

Loosely drape a piece of plastic wrap over the bread pan. (If the day is humid, lightly flour the wrap to prevent the dough from sticking.) Place the dough in a draft-free place where the temperature is between 80F to 90F. allow dough to rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size; if you are using a 7 1/2 inch loaf pan, the dough should fill the pan and puff slightly higher than the rim of the pan at the center. Avoid letting the dough rise too much, or a large bubble may form just beneath the top of the loaf, causing the loaf to flatten-rather than puff-as it bakes.

About 20 minutes before the end of the rising time, set rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400F.

Note: Recipe may be temporarily arrested at this point by freezing the risen loaf.


STEP 8: BAKING THE BREAD

Place the risen loaf in preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes. Avoid
opening the oven door during the first 20 minutes of baking, while the bread is expanding. When the bread is done it will have shrunk perceptively from the sides of the pan. To be absolutely certain that it is fully baked, invert the loaf onto your hand
(protected with a pot holder ) and thump the bottom with your finger-it should sound hollow, as though it were a shoe box filled
with crumpled wads of tissue paper. If the bread sounds more like a filled carton f milk, return the loaf to the pan and bake
5 o 10 minutes longer. Remember that bread often looks done on the outside while the interior is still sticky.

Note: Two smaller loaves will need only 30 to 35 minutes in the oven.


STEP 9: COOLING AND STORING THE BREAD

As soon as the bread is done, unmold it right side up onto a wire rack; if hot bread is allowed to stand in the pan it will soften and wrinkle disappointingly. At room temperature, the bread will take about
2 hours to cool completely. Avoid the temptation to slice the bread while still warm. Stem will escape and loaf will dry out; furthermore, bread needs more settling time after baking in order to develop its flavor. If you do slice a warm loaf, immediately turn it cut side down on a plate or on the countertop to finish cooling.

When the loaf is thoroughly cool, place it in a plastic bag, squeeze out
as much air as possible, and tie securely. Store in a bread box or, better, in the refrigerator. If you do not plan to eat the bread within 3 days, wrap it tightly in foil, place in a plastic bag, seal the bag airtight, and freeze. The bread will keep nicely for several months in the freezer, but it should be consumed soon after thawing since the bread has been frozen tends to go stale quickly.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Warm water
  1                Tsp  Salt
  2                Pkg  Dry yeast
  2                     Beaten Eggs
  1 1/2            cup  Lukewarm milk
     1/2           cup  Soft shortening
     1/2           cup  Granulated sugar
  7                cup  Sifted Flour -- To 7 1/2 C

In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in the 1/2 C. warm water. Let it stand for a few minutes to proof (see if it starts to bubble and grow). Stir in the warmed milk, sugar, and salt. Add eggs, shortening (which may be a solid shortening which has been melted, or a liquid shortening, as you prefer). Add half the flour, mix with a spoon. Add additional flour until it becomes too difficult to mix with the spoon. Turn out onto a lightly floured breadboard. Knead by hand, adding flour as it becomes sticky, until it is smooth and shiny, and slightly elastic. Round up in a greased bowl. Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. Punch down, round up, and let rise a second time in the covered bowl until again double in bulk. Divide dough for desired rolls.

This dough can be used for  cinnamon rolls and Philadelphia "Sticky-buns".

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  2% low-fat milk
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- to 3 1/2 cups

Dough: Whisk the eggs until they are frothy, then whisk in the salt.

Heat the milk to 110F and stir in the yeast and sugar.

Combine the eggs and the bean liquid in the bowl of a mixer. Stir briefly to combine, then with the mixer set on slow, gradually add 3 1/4 cups flour. Increase the speed to medium and process for 10 minutes. The dough should cling to the dough hook and be fairly elastic. If the dough is soft and sticky, add the remaining flour.

Reduce the speed to medium slow and process for 5 more minutes, or until the dough is smooth, very elastic, and clinging to the dough hook.

Gather the dough into a ball. Place in bowl and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume; about 1 hour.

After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a well-floured surface. Shape into a loaf and place in an oiled 5 x 8 inch bread pan.

Place the rolled dough in the prepared pan, seam side down. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 325F.

Bake until the top is browned and crisp, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, gently remove the loaf from the pan, and brush the top with the melted butter. Let cool slightly, preferably on a wire rack before slicing.

NOTES : Prudhomme claims it is "...incredibly light, airy, and very fragrant. It rises so much that you may think it's about to explode!"

I see no reason why the dough couldn't be prepared in any ABM that can handle up to 3 1/2 cups of white flour.

Frozen berries (no sugar added) may be substituted for fresh. Thaw and drain before measuring. For thinner jam, use juice as part of the 2 c berry amount. You may decrease the amount of sugar, but it will produce a thinner result. More sugar will make it thicker. For best results, sugar substitutes are not recommended. The average refrigerated life of jam is two weeks; up to several months frozen.

They suggest also trying it on ice cream, waffles, French toast,  pancakes, or as a filling for layer cakes.  Yum, I think I'll try it  out myself now!

                        ***STARTER***
  2               Cups  Warm Water -- About 110F
     1/4      Teaspoon  dry yeast
  2               Cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        (Abt 9 Oz)
                        -- Or Whole Wheat Flour
                        ***SPONGE***
     3/4           Cup  Warm Water -- About 110F
     1/2      Teaspoon  dry yeast
  1                Cup  risen starter -- above
  2               Cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
                        (Abt 9 Oz)
                        ***DOUGH***
                        all the sponge -- above
  1 1/2            cup  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour -- To 1 3/4C
                        About 7 - 8 Ozs
                        -- all-purpose flour,
  2          Teaspoons  Salt
                        cornmeal for the bottom of the loaf

For the starter, place warm water in a glass or stainless steel bowl and whisk in yeast. Stir in flour and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside to rise at room temperature until doubled and bubbly from 2 to 8 hours, depending on room temperature.

For the sponge, place warm water in a glass or stainless steel bowl and whisk in yeast. Whisk in starter, stir in flour smoothly, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise until about triple in volume, about 4 to 8 hours (I like to do this late at night and allow it to rise all night). Stir sponge to deflate and stir in smaller amount of flour and salt. Knead dough by hand to form a smooth, elastic and slightly sticky dough, about 5 minutes, incorporating the remaining flour a tablespoon at a time if the dough is too soft.

To mix the dough in the food processor, place sponge, smaller amount of flour and salt in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse repeatedly until dough forms a ball (if dough will not form ball, add remaining flour a tablespoon at a time, and pulse until dough forms ball. Let dough rest 5 minutes, then let machine run continuously for 20 seconds.

To mix dough in heavy-duty mixer, place sponge, smaller amount of flour and salt in bowl of mixer fitted with dough hook. Mix on low speed to form a smooth, elastic and slightly sticky dough, about 5 minutes, incorporating the remaining flour a tablespoon at a time if the dough is too soft.

Oil a bowl and turn dough into it. Turn dough over so that top is oiled and cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Allow dough to rise until double. Line a round basket or 2-quart bowl with a napkin or tea towel and flour the cloth generously. Remove dough from bowl, press it to deflate, and shape it into a sphere by tucking bottom under and in toward center all the way around. Invert the dough into the cloth-lined basket or bowl so tucked-under edges are on top. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled, about an hour.

When the loaf is almost risen, preheat oven to 500 degrees and set a rack at the middle level. Place a heavy cookie sheet or jelly roll pan or a baking stone on the rack. Sprinkle the top of the loaf with cornmeal and invert it onto a piece of cardboard or a peel. Holding a razor blade at a 30-degree angle to the loaf, quickly slash a cross in the top. Slide the loaf off the peel onto the pan and lower oven temperature to 450 degrees. Bake the loaf for about 45 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 210 degrees. Cool the loaf on a rack and do not cut it until it is completely cooled.

Variations:

PART WHOLE WHEAT BREAD: Make the starter with whole wheat flour and the sponge and dough with white flour. Or, if you make the starter with white flour, substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour in the sponge; and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 to 1 1/4 cups white flour in the dough.

                  Bread Problems: Diagnoses And Rescues

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                 *****

F YOU LEAVE SOMETHING OUT: If you have left out one or more of the liquid ingredients-eggs, water, or milk-the dough will be hard and dry after you add the flour. To fix, simply cut and stir omitted liquid into the dough with a wooden spoon. The dough will look lumpy and messy, but will smooth out during kneading.
If you realize during kneading that you have left out butter, sugar, or salt, simply incorporate these ingredients into the dough as you knead. If you do not discover your mistake until after the dough had its first rise, pat dough into a 14-inch square, sprinkle with sugar and-or salt or smear with softened butter, and knead thoroughly (at least 3 minutes) to incorporate the omitted ingredients. Ideally, you should allow the dough to rise again but you may proceed to form the dough at this point.

IF THE DOUGH WON'T RISE: The yeast may have been old and dead to start with, or may have been killed because it was dissolved in excessively hot water or because the dough was set to rise in too warm a place. To remedy the problem, stir 1 1/2 packages (3 3/4 tsp.) dry yeast (or 1 1/2 cakes compressed yeast) and 1 tsp. sugar into 1/4 c. warm water. Set mixture aside to dissolve and proof. Beat into the yeast mixture 1/2 to 2/3 c. all-purpose flour, or enough to make soft dough. Thoroughly knead (5 minutes at least) this yeast mixture into the bread dough, then let rise until doubled.

IF THE DOUGH IS RISING VERY SLOWLY: Either the room is cold or else too much salt, a yeast inhibitor, was added to the dough.
To get cold dough moving, set bowl in a sink filled with warm water (up to 110F). If you suspect that the salt is the problem, taste the dough. If it is not too salty as to be inedible, simply be patient; it will eventually rise to the desired bulk.

IF THE BAKED LOAF IS GLUEY, WET OR GRAYISH IN COLOR: It is possible that too little flour was added to the
dough. Next time, keep careful track of how many cupfuls of flour you measure into the dough and, if it feels very sticky while you knead (a telltale sign that the flour-to-liquid proportions are askew), incorporate extra flour.
Under baking is a more likely cause of stickiness and wetness. Try the following rescue. Protect the cut end of the loaf with foul and return the bread to a 400 F. oven for 15 to 30 minutes-the more under baked and/or more thoroughly cooled the loaf is , the more time it will need the oven. If this does not produce acceptable results, turn the loaf into bread crumbs or use to make bread pudding.

IF THE BREAD HAS LITTLE FLAVOR: Part or all of the sugar or salt may have been left out, but more likely the first and second rises were terminated before the dough had fully doubled, and thus yeast did not have sufficient time to develop and to flavor the loaf.

IF THE BREAD TASTES SOUR, "ALCOHOLIC": This sometime happens when a bread recipes is held too long in the
refrigerator (sweet breads seem to be especially susceptible).

IF THE BREAD IS DENSE AND DOUGHY: Either the dough was not kneaded enough, or the loaf was put into the oven before it had had a chance to double in the bread pan.

IF THE BREAD IS DRY: Most likely too much flour was incorporated during kneading.

IF THE CRUMB IS UNEVEN, WITH BIG HOLES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LOAF AND UNDER THE TOP CRUST:
There are two possible causes. First, the dough may not have become wholly integrated when it was formed. Next time, be sure to roll the dough into a tight cylinder and to slap, jab, squeeze, and press it into shape before setting it in the bread mold to rise. Second, the dough, may have over risen in the bread pan, causing large gas bubbles to form, especially beneath the top crust. Don't let the dough rise as much next time-or if does, punch it down, reshape the loaf, and let it rise again, keeping a careful eye on it.

IF THE LOAF COLLAPSED OR LEVELED IN THE CENTER DURING BAKING: This is always due to the bread's having over risen before being put in the oven.

NOTES : The dough was a bit on the sticky side, but I continued as directed. They turned out great but kinda flat on top, I filled the cups too full, I think. Plan to try it again, maybe a loaf this time, instead. They were rich, fluffy and buttery. None left, Hubby and Bunchkin ate them fresh and hot out of the oven...

NOTES : Made this the other night with my bulk yeast.  First time for me using  "real" yeast.  I've been a sourdough gal, yeast happens soooo fast!

The dough was a bit on the sticky side (maybe need more flour?), but I continued as directed. They turned out great but kinda flat on top, I filled the cups too full, I think. Plan to try it again, maybe a loaf this time, instead. They were rich, fluffy and buttery. None left, Hubby and Bunchkin ate them fresh and hot out of the oven...the last one was eaten with honey drizzled over it, yum!

                Hand Made                       Sweet Breads & Cakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              batch  quick brioche dough
                        ***ALMOND BRITTLE TOPPING***
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- (3/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  sliced -- blanched almonds
                        ***PASTRY CREAM FILLING***
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  4              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  kirsch -- optional
  1              stick  soft unsalted butter

Butter a 2 by 10-inch pan and line the bottom with a piece of parchment or buttered waxed paper.

To form the dough, fold it over on itself several times on a lightly floured surface and form it into a sphere, rounding it so that the outside skin of the dough is smooth and seamless. Cover the rounded piece of dough with a towel and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Then press dough evenly into the prepared pan and pierce it at 1-inch intervals with a fork. Cover the pan with a towel and allow the dough to rise until it is half again larger in bulk, about 30 minutes. Uncover the dough and refrigerate it for 20 minutes. Immediately after you refrigerate the dough, set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. To make the topping, combine all ingredients except the almonds in a small saucepan. Place the pan over low heat and bring the mixture to a boil stirring constantly. Stir in the almonds, then remove the pan from the heat, and pour the topping into a buttered, heat proof bowl and cool it to room temperature.

After the dough has chilled for 20 minutes, remove it from the refrigerator and, using the back of a spoon or a small offset metal spatula, spread the almond topping evenly. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the topping is well caramelized and the dough is firm and baked through. Remove the pan to a rack to cool for ten minutes, then loosen the topping from the sides of the pan by inserting the point of a small sharp knife 1/2-inch down between the topping and the side of the pan. Unmold the cake, remove the paper and cool it on a rack.

While the cake is baking prepare the filling: Combine 3/4 cup of the milk and the sugar in a non-reactive saucepan over low heat. Whisk once to mix in the sugar and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining milk and cornstarch thoroughly in a small mixing bowl and whisk in the yolks. Whisk in the boiled milk in a stream and return the mixture to the pan. Replace pan over low heat and whisk constantly as the cream thickens and comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Allow to boil, whisking 30 seconds. Remove from heat; whisk in vanilla. Divide the butter into 8 pieces and whisk into the cream one piece at a time. Pour the cream into a bowl, scrape sides of the bowl clean with a rubber spatula and press plastic wrap against the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate cream until cold. Remove the cream from the refrigerator and whisk by hand until smooth, about 10 seconds.

To fill the cake, slice it in half horizontally using a sharp serrated knife. Place the bottom layer on a platter and, using a small offset metal spatula, spread evenly with the filling. Cut the top of the cake into 10 or 12 wedges and rearrange them on top of the cake, fitting them closely together. (Pre-cutting the top eliminates pressure when the cake is cut and prevents the filling from oozing out).

                Hand Made                       Sweet Breads & Cakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
  1           envelope  (2 teaspoons) active dry yeast
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached -- all-purpose flour,
                        -- divided
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs

Butter a loaf pan and cut a piece of parchment or waxed paper to fit the inside bottom of the pan. Butter the paper. About 40 to 45 minutes after placing the dough in the pan to rise, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, setting a rack in the middle level.

In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the milk until it is just warm, about 110 degrees. Remove from heat and pour into a small bowl. Whisk in the yeast, then stir 1 cup of the flour into the yeast and milk mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature while preparing the other ingredients. It may begin to rise slightly before you add it to the other ingredients.

Cut the butter into 6 or 8 pieces and combine with sugar and salt in the work bowl of a food processor, fitted with the metal blade. Pulse at one-second intervals until the mixture is soft and smooth, scraping the inside of the bowl several times to ensure even mixing. Add the eggs, one at a time, and process until smooth. If the mixture appears curdled, continue to process for about 1 minute longer, until it looks smoother. (It may remain somewhat curdled in appearance.) Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour, then the milk-yeast-flour mixture, scraping it from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pulse at one-second intervals until the ingredients form a soft, smooth dough. Then process continuously for fifteen seconds.

Remove work bowl from base and remove blade. Scrape dough onto a generously floured work surface and fold it over on itself several times to make it more elastic. Press the dough into a rough rectangle, about 9 x 5-inches. Fold each side about 1-inch in toward the center and press firmly to seal. Then starting at the top of the rectangle, fold the dough to the middle. Fold the bottom of the dough up past the seam and pinch to seal. Place the dough in the prepared pan, seam side down. Press the top of the dough firmly with the palm of your hand to flatten it and fill the pan evenly. Cover with a piece of buttered plastic wrap or a towel and allow to rise until it is about one inch above the rim of the pan. Using the corner of a razor blade or the tip of a sharp knife held at a 30 degree angle to the top of the loaf, cut a slash down the middle of the top beginning and ending about one inch from the ends of the loaf. Bake the loaf for about 40 minutes, until it is well risen and a deep golden color. Place the pan on a rack to cool 5 minutes. Then invert the loaf to the rack and turn it on its side to cool.

NOTES : I did this recipe 2 ways, the way it is entered and then a second time using 1 cup real buttermilk for the powdered buttermilk and water. I really prefer the real buttermilk - there is a definite taste difference for the better.

This rises really high!  Might try cutting the yeast back just a bit...

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     2/3      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
  4               cups  bread flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        ***SPINACH FILLING***
  10 1/2        ounces  frozen chopped spinach
                        garlic powder -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  provolone cheese -- grated
  1                cup  mozzarella cheese -- grated

Remove dough from machine and roll it into circles of approximately 8 inches. Spread filling on one half of the circle leaving a border around it for closing. Close the calzone by folding the unfilled side on top of the filled side and crimping the edges closed with your fingers or a fork. Place on a lightly greased baking pan. Let rise approx. 30 minutes. Brush lightly with olive oil and bake at 500 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until puffed and golden. (I bake them at 485 degrees for 15 minutes in my oven.) The original recipe says to put 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons each or ricotta and grated mozzarella cheese in each calzone. >> My favorite filling is the following......

SPINACH FILLING : Saute thawed spinach in olive oil and garlic powder until all water has evaporated. (I squeeze out excess liquid first) Mix cheeses into spinach. You may substitute frozen chopped broccoli for spinach.

  3               cups  flour

  4        Tablespoons  honey
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chestnuts -- peeled

                        Start the yeast culture off by mixing the

                        and cover with a little water. Bring this
                        to the boil and simmer with a lid on
                        until the chestnuts are soft (Too much
                        boiling turns everything to a mush).
                        Mix the flour, salt and honey into the
                        bowl with a dash of olive oil. When the

                        Chop up the chestnuts into little bits
                        and add to the flour. Mix it all up, add
                        the yeast and begin the knead. Keep going
                        all the way and let the dough rest 2 or
                        three times. Knock down at least twice
                        and then split into your favorite tins (I
                        use 3 small 5x2x3 tins). Place in the
                        oven at 400 + and cook until golden
                        brown. Turn out onto the wire rack and if
                        you can wait that long ;) let the bread
                        cool. I can't really tell you what to do
                        here as ours never lasts that long!

NOTES : I changed this recipe by using 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese instead of cheddar, (and no onion), put it all in the machine at once using overnight timer setting. The result was a wonder strong flavored loaf that was somewhat like sour dough. Hope that you enjoy it as much as we did. I am sending the one pound recipe...you can adjust for the size loaf you need.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 3/4        34 cups  unsifted flour -- (5 3/4 to 6)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2            tsp  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  softened margarine
  2               cups  very hot tap water
  1 1/2           cups  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/4           cup  onion -- finely chopped

In a large bowl thoroughly mix 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast. Add margarine.

Gradually add very hot tap water to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 1 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick batter. Beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in cheese, onion and enough additional flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about one hour.

Punch dough down; turn out onto lightly floured board. Divide dough into 20 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball; place balls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.

Bake in hot oven (400 degrees) about 15-20 minutes, or until done. Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire racks.

[It goes without saying, so why am I adding this, but Fleischman margarine and yeast are specified here...]

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  unbleached white flour
                        -- OR a mixture of white and whole wheat
     1/4           cup  gluten flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  oil
  1            package  yeast or 1 tablespoon bulk dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
                        Pesto sauce -- optional

Mix the seasonings and oil with the warm water. Add the flours and knead until as smooth dough results. Allow to rise for 30 minutes or longer to relax before spreading in a large Chicago style pan or 2 flat pizza pans. Be sure to use the black pepper as it adds to the flavor.

For Pesto crust, add 2-4 tablespoons of pesto with the oil This makes a good dough in a bread machine on the dough setting.

Drizzle or brush a light coating of olive oil over the crust. Add the tomato sauce and toppings. Bake until just beginning to brown, and then add the cheese(s). This will tend to make a less drippy sauce.

Seasoned pepper, ground chipotle pepper, or crushed red pepper may be added to the dough instead of black pepper for a more spicy flavor.

  1                can  tomato sauce (28 oz.)
                        ***OR***
  1       16 ounce can  sauce with
  1                can  (6 0z) tomato paste
  6             ounces  water (or less for thicker sauce)
                        ***SEASONINGS***
     1/2      teaspoon  salt (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  2          teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  2          teaspoons  fennel seed
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Mix all the ingredients and allow to set for at least 30 minutes before use. The Fennel Seed is a key to the flavor!! Fresh herbs in season replace the Italian seasoning. Finely minced fresh onion can replace the onion powder. Ken's favorite -- omit the salt and add a few chopped anchovy fillets or 2 teaspoons of anchovy paste.

This sauce is thick and spreads well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened baking cocoa
     1/4           tsp  baking soda
     1/4           cup  sugar -- (to taste ) (1/4 to
                        -- 1/2)
  2                tsp  baking powder
     1/2           cup  shortening
  1                tsp  vanilla
     1/2           cup  milk

Combine the dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening as you would do for pie dough to achieve a crumb texture. Mix vanilla and milk. Gradually stir liquids into flour mixture to produce a soft dough . Knead briefly on a lightly floured surface . Roll or pat dough out to 1/2 inch thick. Cut out with biscuit cutter and bake 450F for 12 to 15 minutes or done. These are nice for breakfast with butter and jam or could even be used as a dessert biscuit. The number of biscuits you get are dependent on how large or small your biscuit cutter is.These freeze well . Enjoy!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Brioche dough:
  2        tablespoons  warm water
                        -- (110 to 115 degrees F)
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- divided, plus
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  dry yeast
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  9              large  eggs -- at room
                        temperature, divided
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- (2 sticks) softened
                        ---
                        Chocolate filling:
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

YIELD: 2 loaves
DIFFICULTY: **
PREPARATION: 1 hour plus rising, baking, and cooling times.

Make the brioche dough:

1.In a small bowl, combine the water with 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Sprinkle the
yeast over the water and set the mixture aside for 10 minutes, until foamy; if the mixture is not foamy, the yeast may be inactive and should not be used.
2.In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer set on low speed, using the paddle attachment, combine the flour, the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and the yeast mixture. Add eight of the eggs, one at a time, until combined. Increase the speed to medium and continue to beat the mixture for 3 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. At low speed, add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is incorporated into the dough. Transfer the dough to a large, buttered bowl. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 1/2 hours, or until almost doubled in bulk. While the dough is rising, make the chocolate filling.

Make the chocolate filling:

1.Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and allow it to stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Gently whisk the chocolate mixture until smooth. Whisk in the beaten egg and vanilla. Transfer the filling to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until the brioche dough is ready to fill.

Shape the brioche dough:

1.After the brioche has risen, punch the dough down and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least eight hours, or up to two days.
2.Butter two 8-1/2-by-4 1/2-by-2 1/2-inch loaf pans. On a floured work surface,
divide the brioche dough in two. Working with one half of the dough at a time, roll each piece into a 7-by-15-inch rectangle. Spread half of the chilled chocolate filling over each rectangle, and roll each into a tight jelly roll, starting with a short end. Gently place each roll seam-side-down into one of the prepared pans. Cover the pans with a tea towel and allow the brioche loaves to rise at room temperature for one hour.

Bake the loaves:

1.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Crack the remaining egg into a small bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of water and whisk until smooth. Using a pastry brush, brush the eggwash over the tops of the brioche loaves. Bake the loaves for 35 to 40 minutes until the loaves are deep golden brown. Cool the loaves in the pans set on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Unmold and cool the loaves on the rack completely before slicing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  milk
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil

1. In cup, combine yeast, sugar, and 1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F.). Let stand until yeast mixture foams, about 5 minutes.

2. Into bowl of heavy-duty mixer, measure flour and salt. With wooden spoon, stir in milk, olive oil, yeast mixture, and 2 cups warm water (105 to 115 degrees F.) until blended. With dough hook, mix on medium speed 15 minutes or until dough becomes elastic. (Or, if you prefer to mix by hand, in very large bowl, combine ingredients as above and stir with wooden spoon 15 minutes or until dough becomes elastic.) This is a very sticky and moist dough; resist the urge to add more flour, and do not knead or stir for less than the suggested time.

3. Scrape dough into greased large bowl; with greased hand, pat top of dough to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let dough rise in warm place (80 to 85 degrees F.) until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

4. Flour large cookie sheet. With floured hand, punch down dough and divide it in half. Turn pieces of dough onto cookie sheet, about 3 inches apart; cover and let rest 15 minutes for easier shaping. With hands, pull 1 piece of dough into 14" by 4" oval. Repeat with remaining piece of dough, still keeping loaves 3 inches apart. With floured fingers, make deep indentations all over each loaf, making sure to press all the way down to cookie sheet. Sprinkle loaves lightly with flour. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.

5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place 12 ice cubes in 13" by 9" metal baking pan. Place pan in bottom of oven. Bake loaves on middle rack 25 to 30 minutes until golden, using spray bottle to spritz loaves with water 3 times during first 10 minutes of baking. Cool loaves on wire rack.

  1              batch  quick brioche dough
                        ***CINNAMON PECAN FILLING***
  2               cups  pecan pieces
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        white of 1 large egg
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     3/4           cup  strained apricot preserves
     1/2           cup  raisins or currants
                        ***CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR ICING***
  2               cups  confectioners sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice

Line a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment or foil.

Roll dough into an 8 by18-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in half the long way, slide the 4 by18-inch dough onto a cookie sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. To make the filling, place the pecan pieces in the work bowl of a food processor. Process until they are reduced to a paste. Add the sugar and pulse several times to mix. Add all the filling ingredients except the preserves. Remove the rectangle of dough from the refrigerator and unfold it on the work surface. Spread the dough evenly with the filling, using a small offset metal spatula. Stir the preserves to soften them, then spread evenly over the filling with a spatula. Sprinkle with the raisins.

Begin at one of the long ends and roll the filling up in the dough to form a roll about 18-inches long. If the dough has softened during the spreading and rolling, cut the roll in half, slide both pieces onto a pan and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Mark the top of the roll at 1 1/2-inch intervals, then cut through with a sharp, thin knife, making 12 slashes in the roll. Arrange the slashed piece of dough on the pan and connect the ends. Fan out the cut portions. Cover pan with buttered plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until the spaces between the rolls are filled in, up to one hour. About 40 minutes after putting the cake to rise, set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Bake about 45 minutes, until the dough is firm and baked through and a deep golden color. Place the pan on a rack until cool enough to handle, then slide to a cooling rack. When cool, invert to a platter and drizzle the cake with the icing.

To make icing:

Combine confectioners' sugar and orange juice and place over low heat. Stir until luke-warm, then drizzle over cooled cake.

            Coffee Cake Bread With Dried Fruit, Special <R T>

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 LB Loaf: -- (1 Lb Loaf)
  3 1/2            cup  Bread Flour
  1                Tsp  Salt
     1/2           cup  Sugar
     1/4            Lb  I Can't Believe It's Not Butter - Light -- *Note
     3/4           cup  Egg Beaters=AE 99% Egg Substitute -- **Note
     1/2           cup  Water
  1               Tbsp  Dry Yeast
     2/3           cup  Dried Cherries -- ***Note
     1/3           cup  Chopped Almonds -- ****Note
                        Optional

Because this is a 1 1/2 lb loaf that I made, it is supposed to serve 14 but realistically I felt it should serve 10 and this is what I based the nutritional analysis on.

*NOTE: Original recipe used butter (1 stick =3D 8 Tbsp), cut into 1/2"= pieces
**NOTE: Original recipe used 3 eggs
***NOTE: Or dried fruit such as dried dates, apricots, blueberries or cranberries ****NOTE: Or walnuts or pecans (if desired)

Place all ingredients except the dried fruit in the machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bake the bread on the white bread cycle. Add the chopped fruit after the first kneading or according to the manufacturer's recommendation on when to make additions. When the baking is complete, remove the bread pan from the machine with potholders or oven mitts. Turn the pan upside down, and shake out the loaf. Place the bread on a wire rack to cool.

NOTES : This tasted better then I expected it to.  This specialty is often similar in taste to a sweet, fragrant bread. It is richer and sweeter than most other breads. Plain or toasted it is outstanding.

NOTES : Well, here goes....it was delicious! And no one guessed what made it both tasty and colorful!
---

I have only been on this list several weeks now & I am enjoying it very much. I just had to say that I made the Cole Slaw bread that someone posted (sorry, don't know who) last week. I have to say that out of all the breads that I have made in my ABM it came out just perfect. It was extremely light especially considering that it had 1 cup of whole wheat flour in it. I did make 2 changes to the recipe. I used applesauce instead of the oil & I added 1 T. of gluten for the whole wheat flour. I didn't think that it was going to turn out at all because I was not paying attention to the dough & when it came time to add the cole slaw at the "beep" I noticed that the dough was way too "wet" so I quickly added more flour with 10 min. of kneading time left, but it still was perfect.

  2                cup  flour, all-purpose
  1               Tbsp  baking powder

  1                Tsp  vanilla extract
  4               Tbsp  unsalted butter -- melted

Preheat oven to 350F. Combine the cranberries and sugar in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse to coarsely grind. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, spices and salt. Add the orange zest and walnuts. Toss to blend.

In a small bowl, combine the orange juice and egg substitute. Beat with a whisk until frothy. Add the vanilla extract and cranberry mixture. Stir to combine. Pour over the dry ingredients and drizzle with the butter. Stir with a spatula just until moistened and cranberries are evenly distributed.

Pour the batter into a loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The top surface should be crusty and golden. Turn the loaf out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature overnight before serving.

You buy wheat, soak it overnight in water, drain water, cover with water, allow to sit on counter until sprouts form about the same length as the wheat. Then place on cookie sheet and place in oven. Dry at about 250 degrees, do not brown. When dry place in coffee grinder(clean out coffee grounds well) and grind to coffee-like consistency. Use in your bread and enjoy.

  1                cup  wheat berries
                        tepid water

In a seed sprouter or a wide-mouth quart canning jar, with the ring fitted with a plastic strainer, fine cheesecloth or rust-proof mesh screening, soak wheat berries overnight in water to cover. Drain well and place the jar in a shallow pan, tilted so that excess water can drain out and air can circulate. Cover loosely with a cloth. Keep in a warm, dark place, rinsing and draining twice a day. When the sprouts are about the same length as the grain, rinse and drain well and spread the sprouts on 2 ungreased cookie sheets. Dry in a 150F oven, no hotter, for about 8 hours, or until sprouts are crunchy. Grind them in a food mill, seed grinder or blender. Store in a dry, airtight container in the refrigerator. Will keep indefinitely. Use in yeast breads at the rate of about 1 T. malt in place of about 1/4 C. honey or other sweetener. Use to flavor milkshakes and cereal, too.

It was such a big hit as a gift that it eventually became the starting point for this cookbook. We urge you to give this as a gift and see what good fortune awaits you, too.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4            Oz  Active Dry Yeast -- (1 Envelope)
  5                cup  All-Purpose Flour -- Divided
     1/2           cup  Sugar -- Plus
  2               Tbsp  Sugar -- Divided

     1/2           cup  Milk
  1              Whole  Egg -- Lightly Beaten

In large bowl, combine yeast and 1/2 C lukewarm (110 - 115F) water; let stand until foamy. Stir in 4 C flour, 1/2 C sugar and salt. With pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in yolks and milk. Beat until dough begins to pull from sides of bowl. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface; knead dough, incorporating any remaining flour, 1/4 C at a time, to prevent sticking, about 10 min or until smooth and elastic. Place in bowl coated with butter-flavored cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm area 1 1/2 hrs or until doubled in bulk. Punch down dough. Divide into 3 pieces and shape each piece into an 18" long rope. Lay strips side by side and braid loosely, beginning in the middle and working to each end. Place on greased baking sheet, cover with towel and let rise 1 hr or until almost doubled in size. Heat oven to 350F. In bowl, whisk together egg and 1 Tbsp water. Brush bread with some of the egg mixture. Bake 30 min. Brush again with egg mixture. Bake 10 - 15 min more or until bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.

Add all ingredients into your bread machine per manufacturer. Use Sweet, White, Light crust setting. Do not use your timer, as there are ingredients that will spoil. You can either bake it in a loaf in your machine or use the dough cycle (MAKE 1 1/2 lbs. only). Upon completion, remove the dough, divide it into three sections, braid, and let rise for 30 minutes. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25-30 minutes. Do not overbake, as it will dry out.

Glaze method: Add sugar to beaten egg and mix well. Brush on raised bread. Sprinkle sugar and poppy seeds or chopped or sliced almonds on the top and bake. If doing this in the machine, be very careful not to spill into the machine itself!

NOTES : Jo adapted this bread from her mother-in-law's recipe which she used to serve each afternoon with coffee. The men in the fields would listen for the whistle of the afternoon train at 3:00, the signal to go home for their coffee and pulla. It is usually made in a straight braid, but may sometimes be shaped into a wreath for special occasions. Jo says that sometimes she adds a tsp. of vanilla and some chopped citrus fruit for a slightly different flavor.

Fixes for the stuck paddle:

(1) Soaking with warm water...

(2) Holding the nut under the pan, while wiggling the paddle back
and forth....

(3) Slipping a loop of strong cord under the paddle and yanking it...

(4) Last resort: Use a pair of needle-nose pliers!

When you finally get it off, put a little vegetable oil on the shaft to facilitate removing it in the future.

All flour is presifted but it settles during shipment. A cup of flour scooped directly from the bag can weigh up to 5 ounces. It SHOULD weigh 4 ounces. To measure correctly fluff up flour in the bag or canister. Then sprinkle it lightly with a spoon into a measuring cup, scrape the excess off the top with a knife.

The source for these alternatives is the American Dietetic Association, as
quoted by Bernard Clayton in his bread book.

  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt -- 1 teaspoon
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  butter or margarine -- 1 tablespoon
  3        Tablespoons  sugar -- 2 tablespoons
  2        Tablespoons  nonfat dry milk -- 1 tablespoon
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  RED STAR active dry yeast -- 1 1/2 teaspoons
     1/4           Cup  melted butter or margarine -- 1/4 cup
  1              Clove  garlic -- crushed, 1 clove
  2        Tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese -- 2 tablespoons

Place first 7 ingredients in bread pan, select "dough" setting, and press "start".

Once dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep. Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out dough onto a floured counter top or cutting board.

Gently roll and stretch dough into a 24-inch rope. Grease two 8-inch pie pans.

For 1 1/2-pound: With a sharp knife, divide dough into 24 pieces. (Hint: First cut dough into 12 equal pieces then cut each of those in half.)

For 1-pound: With a sharp knife, divide dough into 16 pieces. (Hint: First cut dough into 8 equal pieces then cut each of those in half.)

Shape into balls; place in prepared pie pans. In a small bowl, combine butter and garlic; pour over rolls. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Cover and let rise in warm oven 30 to 45 minutes until doubled. (Hint: To warm up oven slightly, turn oven on "warm" for one minute, then turn it off, and place covered rolls in oven to rise.)

Preheat oven to 375F. Bake for 15 minutes until golden. Remove from oven, cut apart, and serve warm.

1 1/2-pound yields 24 rolls
1-pound yields 16 rolls

NOTES : I don't know how these compare [to Red Lobster's], but they're usually a hit whenever we  bake them for family or friends.

These garlicky rolls are incredibly light and delicious hot out of the oven! We've also found that they go over very well at potluck suppers.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           Cup  water -- warmed
  2           Packages  dry yeast
  2               Cups  water -- warmed
     1/2           Cup  nonfat dry milk
  2        Tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  1                Cup  cornmeal
  2               Cups  whole wheat bread flour
  3               Cups  all-purpose flour -- approximately
  2               Cups  Granola

Put the 1/2 cup warm water in a mixing bowl; sprinkle the yeast over, stir, and let stand to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the 2 cups warm water, nonfat dry milk, and butter, and stir to blend. Beat in the salt, cornmeal, and whole wheat bread flour and mix until smooth. Add 2 cups all-purpose flour and beat until well mixed. Beat in as much more flour as is needed to make a manageable dough. Add the granola.

Turn the dough onto a floured board ( or use a dough hook on the electric mixer ) and knead for a minute. Let the dough rest 10 minutes. Resume kneading until the dough is elastic, about 5 more minutes. Put the dough into a greased bowl and turn to coat all sides. Cover and let rise to double its bulk. Punch the dough down and divide in half. Put the dough into two greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 3-inch loaf pans. Let rise to the tops of the pans. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 45 minutes, or until lightly browned and done. Cool on racks.

     1/4           cup  Warm Water (110 to 115

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Straight Dough
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 3/4           cups  noncarbonated bottled water -- warm
  1         Tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- to 4 1/2
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  6             ounces  provolone cheese -- minced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- minced
  1              small  zucchini -- minced
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten

To make the dough in the Kitchen Aid electric mixer, dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the water in the mixer bowl and proof, then add the remaining 1 1/4 cups water and the olive oil. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and on low speed, mix the yeast into the water . Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes, until the mixture has lots of chalky-looking bubbles on the top. Then blend the yeast and water. Add the flour 1 cup at a time, stirring on low speed to blend the ingredients. Add the salt with the third addition of flour.Turn the speed to medium-high and add just enough additional flour to create a dough that moves away from the sides of the bowl and clings to the dough hook . Stop the machine and feel the dough. It should be soft, but not sticky or gummy. If it is too sticky, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until the right consistency is obtained. If the dough is dry and crumbly, add a little water, about a teaspoon at a time, until the dough becomes soft and smooth.
Remove the bowl from the mixer base and turn the dough out onto a floured surface. With your hands, knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, forming it into a ball. Lightly spray a large bowl with vegetable or olive oil and place the dough in the bowl. Turn the dough to coat with the oil, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise until doubled in size. When the dough has risen and is almost doubled in size, it is ready to be used for the breadsticks.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease baking sheets with olive oil spray and set aside.
In a bowl, mix the cheese, prosciutto, zucchini, and salt together. Set aside. Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky. Divide the dough in half. Work with one half at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with a towel or bowl. On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough out into a rough circle about 14 inches in diameter. Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Spread half the filling ingredients evenly over the dough.
Starting from the edge nearest you, roll the dough up to keep the filling from falling out. Pinch the seam closed. Stretch the dough into a 14-inch log. Cut the log into 14 pieces with a knife. On the floured surface, roll each piece under the palms of your hands into a 10-inch long stick. Don't worry if some of the filling falls out---just press it back into the dough. Place the sticks on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them evenly. Brush the tops of the sticks with some of the beaten egg.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the breadsticks are golden brown and shiny. Remove the breadsticks to a cooling rack. Meanwhile, repeat the shaping process with the remaining dough, oil and filling. When the first breadsticks are done, bake the second batch.

Makes 28 breadsticks.

Irwin Franzel came up with the solution when he vacationed in Denver several years ago. He was kind enough to allow us to reprint his advice in our book THE BREAD MACHINE MAGIC BOOK OF HELPFUL HINTS. So to quote Irwin and ourselves:
At higher elevations, the dough "overproofs." Due to the lower barometric pressure at high altitudes, the carbon dioxide gas bubbles created by the yeast expand more rapidly. Therefore, the bread rises too high, the gluten loses its strength, and the bread collapses during baking. Try the following combination of suggestions:
Reduce the amount of yeast by about 1/3. This will create less carbon dioxide and the bread will not rise as quickly.
Increase the salt by 25%. This will have the same effect as decreasing the yeast. The bread will rise slower and be less likely to sink during baking.
Add from 1/2 to 1 T gluten per cup of flour. Increasing the gluten will give added strength to your bread.
Watch your dough as it mixes. You may need to add at least 1 to 3 T more liquid since flour stored at high altitudes tends to be drier.
Two other options: Because of the rapid-rising nature of high-altitude breads, try baking them on the Rapid Bake cycle of your machine to reduce the rising time. Or, if your machine has a programmable mode, watch the loaf as it rises; when it nears the top of the bread pan, switch to the Bake cycle manually.

If you have a bread machine place ingredients in order as machine instructs for dough cycle, adjusting water/flour ratio to get a smooth pliable dough . If you choose the hand method, do the same adjusting flour/water ratio to form a smooth elastic dough , hand kneading about 8 to 10 minutes.

Note: I did  use the machine dough cycle.

When abm dough or hand made dough is done, let the dough rise double covered in a warm bowl in a warm place. Punch down, knead briefly and divide dough in half for 2 loaves. Hand form into two torpedo shaped loaves. If you have the metal bread tubular forms for french types bread use that to let the loaves rise double in.Otherwise shape the loaves less wide and place on cornmeal lined baking sheets to rise. Slash the dough deeply in 3 places across the top prior to rising, brush or spray with water and sprinkle on sesame seeds. When the bread is puffy, bake in a preheated 450 degree oven about 30 minutes or golden. Spritz with water at intervals the first 15 minutes of baking. For the crispiest crust, place on preheated baking stones if possible. When done, remove bread to racks to cool. Let cool to room temperature prior to slicing for the Garlic Bread Spread (see recipe).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  4                     eggs -- beaten
  6                     ripe bananas -- mashed
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  macadamia nuts

In a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a light lemon color. Then add the squashed bananas and the beaten eggs. Stir well until all ingredients are completely mixed. Sift the flour, the salt and the baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the chopped nuts. Again mix until blended but make sure you do not mix the batter too much. Pre heat the oven to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake for 45 minutes. Before my wife died she often watched while I was making a mess in her kitchen doing my imitation of a bakery chef. She said that the Kona Inn Banana Bread should be renamed Garbage bread because I never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of thing that I found such as any kind of chopped nuts, lemon and orange zest, chopped apricots, chopped mango, coconut flakes and one time I even added some mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince pies. Perhaps the Kona Inn should have taken me to court and forced me to stop making changes to their Banana Bread. Perhaps my use of their name for the resulting strange flavored versions of their Banana bread had something to do with their going out of business some years ago.

  2                tsp  yeast

Use sweet bread setting on breadmaker.

Tip for grated lemon peel:
When I use a lemon or an orange, I peel the rind with a potato peeler and
save the pieces in the freezer. Every so often, I grind the frozen peels in
my food processor, and save the resulting stuff in  the freezer.  It's easy
to remove the amount required whenever you need it.

NOTES : This loaf was a hit at the office this morning. It makes excellent toast and tastes great plain or buttered with just a dab of marmalade. The original recipe is from Bread Machine Magic (Rehberg & Conway, of course) and calls for milk rather than water. I wanted to used the delayed timer cycle so I substituted water for the milk, added powdered milk, and a little extract for "extra orangeness".

I also seemed to have an over-flow problem with the amount of filling, so I cut back a little. I have a bread machine and wanted to use it for the dough. I also added a glaze for the ring. It looks like a totally different recipe, but the end result is basically the same...a great tasting orange breakfast bread! Here's my conversion:

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  all-purpose flour -- (6 to 6 1/2)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2           packages  FLEISCHMANN'S Active Dry
                        -- or RapidRise Yeast
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine

In large bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt. Heat water, milk, and butter until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). Gradually add mixture to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed, scraping bowl occasionally.

With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.

If desired, freeze half or all of dough for later use (see directions below).

To bake immediately: Place kneaded dough in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 60 minutes. (With RapidRise Yeast, cover kneaded dough and let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.)

Shape, let rise, and bake according to selected preparation.

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD: Replace 1 to 3 cups all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.

LOAF (use 1/2 of dough): Roll dough to 12- x 7-inch rectangle. Beginning at short end, roll up tightly as for jelly roll. Pinch seam and ends to seal. Place, seam side down, in greased 8 1/2- x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; let cool on wire rack. Makes 1 loaf.

HEARTH BRAID (use 1/2 of dough): Divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece to 16-inch rope. On greased baking sheet, braid 3 ropes together; pinch ends to seal. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 90 minutes. Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water; brush over braid. Sprinkle with SPICE ISLANDS Sesame Seed or Poppy Seed. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; let cool on wire rack. Makes 1 braid.

CINNAMON-DATE ROLLS (use 1/2 of dough): Roll dough to 15- x 12-inch rectangle; brush with 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon SPICE ISLANDS Ground Cinnamon, and 3/4 cup imported chopped or snipped pitted dates. Beginning at short end, roll up tightly as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 (1-inch) rolls. Place rolls, cut sides up, in greased 9-inch round cake pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; let cool on wire rack. Frost with Powdered Sugar Icing (recipe follows), if desired. Makes 1 dozen rolls.

Powdered Sugar Icing: In small bowl, combine 1 cup powdered sugar, sifted; and 1 to 3 tablespoons milk. Stir until smooth.

PIZZA (use 1/2 of dough): Grease 1 (14-inch) or 2 (12-inch) round pizza pan(s). Roll dough and fit into prepared pan(s). Top as desired. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done. Makes 1 (14-inch) or 2 (12-inch) pizza(s).

FOCACCIA (use 1/2 of dough): Grease 15- x 10-inch pan. Roll dough to rectangle and press evenly into pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until slightly risen, about 20 to 40 minutes.

FREEZING AND STORING MASTER BREAD DOUGH: To freeze: After kneading, divide dough in half. Flatten each half to 6-inch disk and wrap, airtight, in 1-gallon plastic freezer bags. Freeze for up to 1 month.

To thaw: Thaw in sealed bag and allow to rise slightly in refrigerator, on counter, or in microwave oven. Check dough frequently; thawing and rising times vary according to the temperature of the dough, room, or refrigerator. Once thawed, remove dough from bag; shape, let rise, and bake as directed. Use these times as a guideline for thawing:

Refrigerator: 8 to 16 hours.

Countertop: 4 to 9 hours.

Microwave oven: Microwave dough 10 minutes on LOW (10% power); turn dough over, and rotate a quarter turn. Let rest 10 minutes. Repeat 1 or 2 times, until dough is thawed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               Cups  flour -- * (approximately)
  1                Cup  spring water -- (approximately)


* (preferably freshly ground with the coarsest bran sifted out; either hard whole wheat flour or spelt flour)

You will need a medium sized bowl, a rolling pin, a fork, or a metal comb or other utensil for making holes in the breads, and quarry tiles to fit on the rack of the oven or one or two baking sheets.

Place tiles or baking sheets on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat oven to 425=B0F.

When the oven is hot place 2 cups flour in a medium sized bowl and stir in water until a kneadable dough forms; you may have to ass a little more flour or water, depending on your flours. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead very quickly and vigorously until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes. (Although you are trying to get the dough into the oven quickly, the time spent kneading is important, as it makes the dough easier to roll out very thin.) Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces and flatten with lightly floured hands.

Work with one piece of dough at a time, keeping the others covered with plastic wrap. On a lightly floured surface roll out one piece of dough as thin as possible. Prick it all over with a fork or or a sharp toothed comb, and then try to stretch it slightly to widen the holes you have made. Transfer to the quarry tiles or baking sheet, placing it to one side to leave room for more breads and bake for 2 and 1/2 to 3 minutes, until golden on the bottom and starting to crisp around the pricked holes.

Meanwhile, continue rolling out the dough, placing each bread in the oven as it is ready. If you are working with a partner, one should roll out the dough while the other pricks, stretches and bakes the breads. This will be much easier to get the breads baked in time. If your oven is small, you may not be able to fit in enough breads at once to get them done in time. If so, you can bake some of the breads on the your stove top in a dry skillet, to get them all started baking within the 18 minute time limit.

For a traditional crisp, dried matzoh, leave the breads out on a rack to cool completely and to dry.

With the small amount of dough this recipe makes, you can get all the breads into the oven if not completely baked) in less than eighteen minutes from when we first add water to the flour. the recipe assumes that you wish to make matzoh within the time limit; without a large commercial oven, and several helping hands for the rolling out, you must begin with a small amount of dough to get all the breads done in time. To make more, make the recipe again a second time. If you aren't worried about complying with the time limit, you can bake in larger batches.

Alternatives: If you prefer salted breads, stir in 1 teaspoon of salt into the flour, then add the water. You can add a little olive oil to the dough if you wish. Matzoh made with salt and oil is still matzoh, but not appropriate for a Passover seder (there is no need to rush these breads).


Makes 12 thin breads approximately 8" in diameter.

Matzo is the unleavened bread made from flour and water with no salt, no oil, and - most important, no yeast. It is eaten during Passover to commemorate the haste with which the Jewish people fled Egypt. During Passover no yeast or yeasted products may be eaten. In religiosly observant households, the house is thoroughly cleaned and swept, and all old flour, biscuits and other unleavened products are discarded.

Matzoh must be made quickly and with clean flour in order to prevent naturally occuring yeasts from making the breads rise. The Shulchan Aruch, a sixteenth-century codification of Jewish law, requires that no more than eighteen minutes should elapse. In order to get everything done within the time limit, many hands are needed to roll out the breads and get them cooked, and only small batches can be made at a time.

Historically, Jewish communities, whether in small villages in Italy or in the cities of Iraq or Morocco, turned the production of Matzo shmura, or "kosher for Passover" into a group effort. A special patch of wheat blessed by a rabbi was set aside to be harvested separately.=20 The wheat was milled using specially cleaned (and blessed) millstones in order to ensure no contamination by leavening agents. Most communities decorated their homemade matzoh with small holes, using a metal comb or fork to help prevent the bread from forming air pockets and rising during it's short baking time. If any bread puffed up during cooking, it was pushed down firmly to force the air out.

Today in Moscow, in Jerusalem, in New York, and in many other places in the world, the production of matzoh has been centralized and commercialized. We've come to think of it as a somewhat tasteless cracker that comes in a cardboard box. But homemade matzoh is a far more interesting and tasty bread."

                         Micro Rise Yeast Baking

                  ****

(for 1 and 1 half pound loaf )

Using a 500 watt or better microwave oven with a mid to large capacity cavity
Preferably, your machine should have 10 power settings, but five will do. You can raise dough to double in bulk in 15 minutes. If you just want to jump in without a test, here goes. Set your microwave at 10% power. Put an 8 ounce glass of water in the back. Cover the kneaded dough with plastic wrap and micro-rise in the standard way - Heat 3 minutes, rest 3 minutes, heat 3 minutes, rest 6 minutes (total of 15 minutes). The dough should be doubled in bulk. To find the absolute best setting for your microwave, read on.

1. Read your instruction book. Determine the wattage and capacity of your microwave. If you can't find the book, look for the serial number plate on the back or bottom of the machine. It usually tells the wattage of the machine. For 600 to 700 watt microwave ovens, the setting is generally somewhere between 10% and 35% power, or around 250 watts to Micro-Rise yeast dough. A 500 watt oven usually requires the lowest setting, 10% power. Small-cavity ovens, regardless of the wattage, may require the lowest setting, 10% power, and may require a shortened heating time, 2 minutes.

2. To test your microwave, make a recipe for plain bread in the food processor. Remove the blade. Cover the bowl of dough with plastic wrap and put it into the microwave. Set an 8 ounce glass of water in the back of the microwave. Set at 10% power. Then follow the process set out above.

3. Remove the dough from the microwave and examine it. Ask yourself these questions: did the dough double in bulk? Now pull the dough out of the bowl - is it too hot to handle? Can you hold the dough comfortably in your hand: Take the dough's temperature with an instant read thermometer. It should read no more than 112. Ideally, the dough should be somewhere under 110.

4. If the dough is too cold, make adjustments in the setting, raising it to 20%. Punch the dough down, put it back in the food processor bowl, and repeat the test. If the dough is too hot, drop the time back to 2 ,minutes. If the dough doesn't rise at all and feel hot to the touch, you have probably killed the yeast. Mix up another pack of yeast with warm water and a little four, knead it into the dough, and repeat the test, shortening the cooking time, and/or lowering the setting.

5. In testing the microwave, begin with the lowest setting and work up.

On another topic, I have used the microwave to proof dough but only as a proofing cabinet. I put a glass of water in the microwave, bring it to a boil (about 3 to 4 minutes on high in my machine), put the dough in a covered bowl in the micro which is now warm and steamy, and leave it to proof - about 45 mins to 1 hour depending on the recipe.

I hope these help. I have used the micro-rise method as explained here with some cinnamon rolls which were made with rapid rise yeast in the food processor. They took 60 minutes from start to finish (25 to prepare and 35 to raise and bake). The results were fine although the taste was a little yeasty as they cooled. While hot to warm, they were great.

     1/4           Cup  mashed or riced potato
  4        Tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
     1/4           Cup  sugar
  6             Medium  eggs -- separated
  1 1/2           Cups  brown or white rice flour
  2        Tablespoons  soy flour
  1           Teaspoon  baking powder
  1           Teaspoon  baking soda
  1           Teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2      Teaspoon  salt
     1/8      Teaspoon  ground pepper -- (optional)
     3/4           Cup  milk -- soy milk, or frozen
                        nondairy creamer

Preheat the oven to 350F. Spray a 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick vegetable spray and brush with butter. (The batter has a tendency to stick.)

IN mixing bowl of electric mixer cream potato with the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating after each addition.

In a separate bowl sift together the rice flour, rice polish, soy flour, baking powder, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt and pepper, if desired. Add to the potato mixture alternately with the milk, stirring after each addition.

Beat the egg whites until softly stiff. Fold into the batter. Pour onto the pan and bake 1 hour. Turn loaf out on wire rack to cool.

Innovations: Whirl 1 cup sunflower seeds in food processor until coarsely chopped. Add to the batter just before the egg whites are folded in. Do not attempt to use whole seeds in batter as they will all end up in the middle of the loaf.

A second loaf and my favorite: Add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon when sifting the dry ingredients. Add 1 cup of coarsely chopped pecans and 1/2 cup currants, scalded, drained, and dried, before folding in the egg whites.

NOTES : I was intrigued because it called for only on rising. Although by itself, it was just a bit sweet for my taste, when toasted or used in a sandwich, it was very nice indeed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active baker's yeast -- 2 1/4 teaspoons
     1/4           cup  water  (110 to 115 degrees) -- warmed
  2               cups  milk   (110 to 115 degrees) -- warmed
  3        Tablespoons  dried minced onions
  2        Tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        Tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3        Tablespoons  prepared mustard
  6               cups  all-purpose flour -- to  6 1/2 cups

In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add milk, onion, mustard, oil, sugar, salt and 4 cups flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth ( I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer ) and elastic, about 6 -8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; divide into 24 pieces. Flatten each piece into a 3-inch circle. Place 1-inch apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.

  2          Teaspoons  orange peel
  1         Tablespoon  sugar

Combine milk, butter, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves. Cool to lukewarm.

Dissolve yeast in warm water in warmed bowl. Add lukewarm milk mixture, eggs and 2 cups flour. Attach bowl and dough hook. Turn to Speed 2 and mix 1 minute.

Place ricotta cheese, orange marmalade, orange peel, and sugar in clean bowl. Attach bowl and flat beater. Turn to Stir Speed and mix 30 seconds.

Punch dough down. Roll into a 10 X 14-inch rectangle. Spread cheese mixture evenly over dough. Roll dough tightly from 10-inch side, pinching seams to seal. Pinch ends together to form a ring and place in a 10-inch bundt pan. Cover; let rise in a warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack.

NOTES : I replaced butter with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, also used Egg Beaters in place of real eggs. I used non-fat ricotta cheese. I used apricot jam in place of the orange marmalade.

Even with all these changes, the bread and filling turned out great. The taste is wonderful. Enjoy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  water 110 degrees F
  3               cups  all-purpose flour or more
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  water to 1 1/4 -- ice cold

Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl; stir briefly. Let stand until foamy ( about 5 minutes ).
To mix and knead with a food processor, combine 3 cups of the flour, sugar, and salt in container. With motor running, pour in yeast mixture and slowly add 1 cup of the cold water. Whirl, scraping sides of container occasionally, until combined ( if dough is dry or difficult to whirl, add more water, 1 to 2 teaspoon at a time ). Continue to whirl until dough is shiny, elastic, and slightly sticky ( 3 to 4 minutes; dough should be soft and wet and form a thin, transparent skin when stretched ). Sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons more flour; turn into a large greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled ( 1 1/2 to 2 hours ) or in a refrigerator until next day. Sprinkle dough with about 2 tablespoons more flour and turn out onto a well-floured board. Cut in half. With floured hands, lightly pat each half into a 7-by 8-inch rectangle. Beginning at a short side, roll up dough, at each turn sealing rolled edge against unrolled portion with heel of hand. Turn loaves seam sides down on board. Gently lift each loaf and generously sprinkle flour beneath; lightly dust top with flour. Cover lightly and let rest for 30 minutes.
Transfer loaves to a large greased baking sheet, picking up each loaf at either end ( if dough sticks to board, scrape free with a spatula ) and allowing dough to stretch to 12 to 14 inches long; space loaves about 4 inches apart. Cover lightly and let rise in a warm place until slightly puffy ( about 15 minutes ).
Place loaves, uncovered, in a 475 degrees F. oven; immediately reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees F. and bake until golden brown ( 20 to 30 minutes ). For a crisper crust, turn off oven, prop door slightly ajar, and let loaves stand in oven for 10 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool. Make 2 loaves ( about 6 servings each ).

  1         Tablespoon  Toasted pecan pieces
                        -- (2 3/4 Ounces)
     1/3           Cup  granulated sugar -- Plus
  1         Tablespoon  granulated sugar
                        -- (2 1/2  Ounces)
  1           Teaspoon  Cinnamon

Yield: 9 Large buns

Equipment: One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick, buttered on
sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil

Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the warm water and the yeast mixture and stir with your fingers to moisten the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass.

Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes. This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice malleable dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)

Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1to 2 more minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F)until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours

While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons butter and the dark brown sugar over  low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it won't be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a little lighter in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting the pan slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them down slightly. Put the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel; be the pan's on a level surface. Put the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly mixed. Set aside.

When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured work surface. Flatten the dough and stretch it with your fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Work gently so you don't tear the dough surface. The dough should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn't sticking to the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary.

Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again  leaving the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare. Starting with the bottom edge, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If the dough sticks to the table as you're rolling, use a dough scraper to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but firmly along the seam to seal it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it is a nice uniform log.

Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator. Cut the log of dough into 9 equal pieces. (It's easiest to mark the roll first to show where you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut completely through the dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of the caramel. Don't worry if it's a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at room temperature until the dough
has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above it. In the meantime, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan of sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns are golden brown and crusty. It's important to bake the buns long enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully turn the pan upsidedown and release the sticky buns onto a large flat heatproof plate. Immediately scrape out any caramel remaining and spread it on top of the buns, filling in any bare spots. Let them cool until just warm before serving.

  2               cups  fresh basil leaves

  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped, minced

  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly grated imported Romano -- or Parmesan cheese

Process in blender or food processor to a smooth paste or puree. This keeps well in the refrig and also freezes well. You said your mother raises herbs, so perhaps she'll indulge you with some fresh basil.

  1               TBSP  rapid rise ("Bread-machine") yeast
  1 1/2            tsp  salt
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  3               cups  all-purpose flour

  3               TBSP  your home-made pesto -- *

* (I know they probably sell it in the grocery 	where you work, but it ain't the same)

Place all ingredients in the machine in the correct order and program for Dough or Manual. When this cycle is completed, pat, roll, stretch the dough into a flat disc on a peel or a 12-14 inch pizza pan which is sprinkled with cornmeal or lightly oiled. Cover with a clean cloth and allow it to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. with shelf and/or stone in center position. Just before inserting the focaccia into the oven, make little dimples all over its surface. Drizzle entire surface with 2 or more TBSP olive oil and sprinkle with 1 - 2 tsp of coarse salt, e.g. Kosher salt. Bake 18-20 minutes until top is golden brown. I baked mine in a pizza pan and at 15 minutes, slid the focaccia off the pan directly onto the stone--supposedly for a crisper crust. Hey, it worked!!

  1               pkg.  yeast
  1                cup  warm water
  1               tsp.  sugar
  1               tsp.  salt
  2              Tbsp.  olive oil -- *
  3 1/2           cup.  flour (approx.)
                        Garlic salt -- parmesan cheese
                        -- (optional - to taste)

* (flavored grapeseed oils also work well - I use basil/garlic, or garlic/parsley grapeseed oils)

In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Stir in sugar, salt and oil. Add 2 cups of flour, beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl; brush top with oil. Cover, let rise in a warm place until double. Punch down; shape at once or cover and refrigerate.

Optional: When mixing in sugar, salt and oil - you can also add some garlic salt, and/or parmesan cheese for flavor.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
  2       tablespoons.  olive oil
  1               tsp.  salt
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour
  1 3/4           tsp.  active dry yeast
  2               tsp.  oregano
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese

Add all to ABM in the proper order for your machine. Program ABM for dough cycle.
At the end of the cycle remove dough and stretch it to fit pizza pan. I hold it up and pull the sides til I get a round shape...keep pulling till pan size. Lightly oil pan and place dough on it. Prick all over with a fork and pop it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes till very lightly browned. I then top pizza with Ragu Hearty Parmesan and Romano flavored sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, and sprinkle parmesan lightly all over top. I added sliced thin pepperoni tonight too. Put it back in the oven for about 10 more minutes.

Combine water, yeast, sugar; cover and let stand till yeast foams, about 5 minutes. Add olive oil, flour and salt. Thicken dough as necessary to make stiff dough. Dough should clean sides of bowl. Knead five minutes. Put dough on board and knead till springs back, about 2 minutes. Put dough in large bowl and let stand in warm place until it is doubled in volume - 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and let rest 10 minutes before shaping. Can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight, but punch down and let warm up before using. Lightly oil pan. Divide dough in quarters, roll out and form. Arrange veggies and cheese. Drizzle with olive oil. Bake 500 degrees 10-12 minutes.

Fry sausage in chunks. Don't brown (fry lightly). Drain off fat. Let cool. Preheat pizza stone to 450 F. Grease pizza pan lightly.

Put fork holes all over dough. Bake dough 5 to 9 minutes (watch top) until off-white or light tan. Be sure that crust bakes enough or it will fall and be "doughy." Puncture with fork or flatten with spatula if it "blows up." Sprinkle wooden peel with corn meal.

Turn oven down to 400 F. Move crust to peel. Wipe off pan with paper towel and put it in oven, below the stone. Brush crust lightly with olive oil. Spread pizza sauce on crust, then rest of ingredients in order shown. Reserve most of cheese.

Slide pizza onto stone. Bake for 15 minutes. Spread rest of cheese on pizza and bake for 5 minutes more, a total of 20 minutes. Move to pan for slicing. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.

NOTES : Use bread pans, and not free form. Reduce baking time, bread tends to burn.

The last few times I made bread, it had a strong yeasty aftertaste to it. The bread came out fine, except for the taste. I made it by hand and used Fleshmanns (sp) yeast from Sam's Club if that made a difference. Now that I think of it I used about 2 tablespoons of yeast for the 2 packages of yeast. Too much yeast??

     1/2          cup.  water
  3              tbsp.  ICBINB-light -- *
  1                     egg
  1               tsp.  salt
     1/3          cup.  mashed potatoes -- **
  2               cup.  all-purpose flour
  3              tbsp.  sugar
  1 1/2           tsp.  yeast

* I Can't Believe It's Not Butter--Light (the original recipe
called for shortening)
** I mixed 1/3 c. instant garlic-flavored potato buds with
1/3 c. water and cooked it in the microwave

Add to bread machine according to manufacturer's directions. Select dough cycle. When complete, place dough on heavily floured board or cloth. When I made this dough, it was very soft and sticky. Gently rolling the dough in the flour on the cloth once was very helpful.

I divided it into 12 balls and placed them in a cooking-sprayed muffin tin. Let rise for 30-45 mins (until doubled).

Bake for 13-14 mins. at 400F.

After putting the dough into the tin, I covered the tin in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator, to be baked for dinner the next day. I took the dough out of the refrigerator as the oven was preheating and then popped them in the oven. I don't know if this is technically correct, but they turned out just fine!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  13                oz  baking potatoes
  3        Tablespoons  brown sugar -- firmly packed
  1         Tablespoon  yeast
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour or as needed
  3        Tablespoons  butter -- melted and cooled
  2          teaspoons  salt

                        Makes two medium loaves.

Scrub potatoes, slice and boil in water to cover until soft. Place the potatoes and cooking water in blender container and add water to bring measure to 3 cups; puree and transfer to large bowl. Stir in brown sugar and cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over, stir to dissolve and let rest at room temperature 45 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the flour and beat vigorously about 3 minutes until air bubbles form. Stir in butter and salt, beat well and gradually add 1 - 1/2 cups of the remaining flour. Let rest at room temperature 45 minutes. Mound remaining flour on board, turn dough out and, using a steel baker's scraper, knead in the flour until dough is stiff enough to knead by hand. Adding additional flour as needed to prevent sticking, knead 3 to 5 minutes. Dough will be soft and slightly sticky. Divide into 2 equal portions, knead briefly, form into 2 loaves and place in 2 oiled loaf pans. Cover with tea towel and let rise in a warm place 45 minutes or until almost double in size. Place in oven, turn heat to 350 degrees F and bake 45 minutes or until bread tests done. Turn out onto wire rack, turn right side up and cool.

NOTES : Yet another one that is worth trying. This recipe, I believe is one of the best I have ever made.

The only ingredient I changed was the butter, I used diet margarine. I also used my KitchenAid mixer to do all the kneading.

                              Red Bean Bread

Recipe By     :Fiery Foods that I Love, Paul Prudhomme
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Filled Breads
                Hand Made

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Bread Dough:
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  liquid from cooking Red Beans
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- to 3 1/2 cups
                        -- Egg Wash:
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
                        Assembly:
                        vegetable oil spray
  3               cups  drained cooked Red Beans
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted

Dough: Whisk the eggs until they are frothy, then whisk in the salt.

Heat the bean cooking liquid to 110F and stir in the yeast and sugar.

Combine the eggs and the bean liquid in the bowl of a mixer. Stir briefly to combine, then with the mixer set on slow, gradually add 3 1/4 cups flour. Increase the speed to medium and process for 10 minutes. The dough should cling to the dough hook and be fairly elastic. If the dough is soft and sticky, add the remaining flour.

Reduce the speed to medium slow and process for 5 more minutes, or until the dough is smooth, very elastic, and clinging to the dough hook.

Gather the dough into a ball. Place in bowl and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume; about 1 hour.

Egg Wash: Blend the sugar, egg, and water together.

Assembly: Lightly spray a 5 x 8 inch bread pan with the oil.

After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a well-floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle, 12 x 20-24 inches. Brush the dough with the egg wash, but leave a 6-inch wide section unbrushed at one of the 12-inch ends. Spread the beans on the dough, except for the section that was not washed with the egg. Leave a 1/2 inch border on the other 3 sides. Starting at the narrow filled end, roll the dough up, jelly-roll fashion, until only 1 inch of the unbrushed section is still sticking out. Brush this flap with egg wash and close the roll, making sure that all layers meet and there is no gap on the sides. It is very important to roll the dough evenly so it will evenly and you'll have a loaf of read that looks as good as it tastes.

Place the rolled dough in the prepared pan, seam side down. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 325F.

Bake until the top is browned and crisp, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, gently remove the loaf from the pan, and brush the top with the melted butter. Let cool slightly, preferably on a wire rack before slicing.

NOTES : Here is another Paul Prudhomme filled bread recipe. In this case he uses cooked red beans for the filling, and the cooking liquid from the beans as the only liquid in the bread. You can make Black Bean Bread by substituting cooked black beans and their cooking liquid.

The red beans (or black beans) can be prepared to your liking, or you can use Prudhomme's recipes in the book.

Substitute cooked black beans and the cooking liquid for the red beans to create "Black Bean Bread".

NOTES : "Folks a wonderful person sent me the 'actual' recipe from Red Lobster, so here it is. Its a lot easier than mine, so please give it at try. The basic recipe is broken down for household rather than their huge batch.

However, you cannot make the EXACT biscuits, because they have a special butter/garlic sauce that is not available to the general public. See how they are!!"

My wife says these are better than the original! [Russ.]

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix Bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.

(Amounts will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.) Serve hot.

The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire. NOTE: this recipe has already been reduced.

NOTES : When the Red Lobster restaurant that we go to started serving their cheese rolls, I managed to talk the manager out of this recipe. It's been posted numerous times since 3/90 by me and by Elaine Radis and others. The quantities I've given are as the manager gave me. Later, I cut the ingredient quantities down to be more usable by the average family. These do freeze, however, so it's worthwhile making the larger batch and freezing the ones you do not plan to use immediately. [ Carole Walberg]

                     Red Lobster Cheesy Garlic Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2             lb  baking mix -- *
  21                oz  cold water
  6                 oz  grated mild cheddar cheese

*RL uses a specially made product, but Bisquick buttermilk baking mix is a decent substitute Mix together above ingredients (by hand, an electric mixer will NOT work) until JUST combined --do not overmix. Scoop with a 1 1/2 ounce scoop onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets (20 per sheet), and bake in a 450 convection oven for 4-5 minutes. Rotate the sheets, and bake another 4-5 minutes. (Note, a commercial convection

oven cooks about 25 percent faster than a home oven -- for the same results, increase the baking time somewhat, but be careful not to overbrown the rolls, they should be a light golden brown). Remove rolls from the oven, and brush with garlic butter mixture (again, RL uses a proprietary product, but you can make a decent imitation by adding garlic powder, NOT salt) to taste, plus some dehydrated parsley flakes to liquid margarine. Do not add too much butter to the rolls, or

the garlic flavor will overpower the cheese. For variations, increase

the cheese to 8 oz. (better, and the way the Lobster used to do it), or substitute about 5 oz. shredded Parmesan (NOT the dried stuff that comes

in a can) for the cheddar. The Parmesan variation is excellent. IMHO, better than the original. As a breakfast bread (or snack for the cook), you may also add 4-5 slices of crisp cooked bacon to this. In this case, brush with regular liquid margarine instead of garlic butter.

Note: this is a half recipe for the ones made at the Lobster. It makes 40 rolls, which is a LOT for home use. You might want to scale it down somewhat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  All-purpose flour -- minus 1 tablespoon
  1         tablespoon  Baking powder -- plus
  2          teaspoons
     1/2      teaspoon  Baking soda
  1              Pinch  Salt -- (1/8 teaspoon)
  3        tablespoons  Margarine -- stick, chilled
     3/4           cup  low-fat Buttermilk -- (1.5%)
  1 1/2         ounces  Cheddar cheese (sharp) -- grated
     1/4      teaspoon  Garlic powder
                        Italian Seasoning

(12 Servings)

1. Preheat oven to 450 F. Line baking sheet with parchment or wax paper; spray with non-stick cooking spray.

2. In medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add 2 tablespoons of the margarine and blend with pastry cutter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk and cheese; combine with fork, handling dough as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet; bake until lightly browned, 8-10 minutes.

3. While biscuits are baking, in small microwavable bowl, add remaining tablespoon margarine; microwave until melted. Stir in garlic powder; set aside. ***I like to add 1/2 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning to the garlic butter.

4. When biscuits are done, remove from oven and brush margarine mixture evenly over warm biscuits. Remove from baking sheet and serve immediately.

NOTES : Of course, WW "lightened" the recipe. They noted that Red Lobster warned that their recipe was developed for commercial use and results wouldn't be the same prepared in household oven. I have made these biscuits and they are wonderful--just like the ones at Red Lobster.

WW also indicated that the Red Lobster recipe used a buttermilk baking mix; and WW reduced the amount of garlicky margarine from 1/2 cup to 1 Tablespoon.

NOTES : Jim's Notes:(all wheat flour may be used, but not all white- the Savina (tm) seems to go good with wheat breads while white has too little flavor for it IMHO) I'll leave it to individuals to try and figure out how to adapt this to their own style of breadmaking. Like I said, this is for one of those auto bread machines simply because I don't know how to bake bread otherwise. If it ain't easy, I ain't got time to do it. I'm sure there are lots of different herb combinations that could be used as well. Hope you all have fun with this! Jim Campbell, Mild to Wild Pepper & Herb Co.

Chris's Note:I sometimes use low sodium vegetable or chicken broth in place of the water.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Bread Dough:
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  2% low-fat milk
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- to 3 1/2 cups
                        garbanzo beans, cooked
                        -- Seasoning Mix:
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
                        ---
  2              heads  garlic
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
                        -- Egg Wash:
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
                        -- Assembly:
                        vegetable oil spray
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted

DOUGH: Whisk the eggs until they are frothy, then whisk in the salt.

Heat the milk to 110F and stir in the yeast and sugar.

Combine the eggs and the bean liquid in the bowl of a mixer. Stir briefly to combine, then with the mixer set on slow, gradually add 3 1/4 cups flour. Increase the speed to medium and process for 10 minutes. The dough should cling to the dough hook and be fairly elastic. If the dough is soft and sticky, add the remaining flour.

Reduce the speed to medium slow and process for 5 more minutes, or until the dough is smooth, very elastic, and clinging to the dough hook.

Gather the dough into a ball. Place in bowl and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume; about 1 hour.

ONION FILLING:  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients.

Remove the papery skin from the garlic heads. Roast the garlic heads  over an open flame on your stove or grill until the outer skin is charred all around.  Plunge the roasted garlic into water, peel the charred cloves, and mince them.

Melt the butter in a 10-inch skillet. Stir in the seasoning mix and the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic begins to stick. Add 1-2 tbsp water as necessary to loosen the brown bits. Set aside until cool enough to handle.

Egg WASH: Blend the sugar, egg, and water together.

ASSEMBLY:  Lightly spray a 5 x 8 inch bread pan with the oil.

After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a well-floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle, 12 x 20-24 inches. Brush the dough with the egg wash, but leave a 6-inch wide section un-brushed at one of of the 12-inch ends. Spread the filling on the dough, except for the section that was not washed with the egg. Leave a 1/2 inch border on the other 3 sides. Starting at the narrow filled end, roll the dough up, jell-roll fashion, until only 1 inch of the untrussed section is still sticking out. Brush this flap with egg wash and close the roll, making sure that all layers meet and there is no gap on the sides. It is very important to roll the dough evenly so it will evenly and you'll have a loaf of read that looks as good as it tastes.

Place the rolled dough in the prepared pan, seam side down. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 325F.

Bake until the top is browned and crisp, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, gently remove the loaf from the pan, and brush the top with the melted butter. Let cool slightly, preferably on a wire rack before slicing.

NOTES : This filled breads use Prudhomme's basic white bread. Of course you can use any basic bread recipe of your choice, but I included his for you since he claims it is "...incredibly light, airy, and very fragrant. It rises so much that you may think it's about to explode!"

I see no reason why the dough couldn't be prepared in any ABM that can handle up to 3 1/2 cups of white flour.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Bread Dough:
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  2% low-fat milk
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- to 3 1/2 cups
                        -- Egg Wash:
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
     1/4           cup  milk
                        -- Filling:
  1 1/4           cups  roasted onions -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  roasted green bell peppers -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  roasted red bell peppers -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  roasted yellow bell peppers -- finely diced
     1/4           cup  roasted garlic -- finely diced
                        ---
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted

Dough: Whisk the eggs until they are frothy, then whisk in the salt.

Heat the milk to 110F and stir in the yeast and sugar.

Combine the eggs and the bean liquid in the bowl of a mixer. Stir briefly to combine, then with the mixer set on slow, gradually add 3 1/4 cups flour. Increase the speed to medium and process for 10 minutes. The dough should cling to the dough hook and be fairly elastic. If the dough is soft and sticky, add the remaining flour.

Reduce the speed to medium slow and process for 5 more minutes, or until the dough is smooth, very elastic, and clinging to the dough hook.

Gather the dough into a ball. Place in bowl and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume; about 1 hour.

Push the top down gently. Separate the dough into 12 to 16 balls, each about the size of a golf ball. Roll the balls into circles, about 5-6 inches in diameter. Place the rounds on a cookie pan, layers separated by foil or waxed paper. Refrigerate them (to stop the rising) until ready to use.

Egg Wash: Combine the beaten egg with the milk.

Filling: To roast the vegetables, if you have a gas range, place the vegetables right on the burner, in a high flame, and roast, turning until the outer skin is charred all around. If your range is electric, you can roast in a preheated 500F oven. Plunge the roasted vegetables into ice water to stop the cooking, then rub off the black skin under running water.

Make the filling by combining the roasted vegetables in a bowl.

Assembly: Brush one side of each round with the egg wash. Divide the filing among half of the dough rounds with the egg-washed side up, and top with the remaining dough rounds, egg-washed side down. Seal the edges all the way around, coat the outer surfaces with the melted butter, and fry, turning often, on a griddle or skillet over medium heat (250F) until golden brown.

  1                tsp  whipping cream
                        FOR ABM:
  2                tsp  instant yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  warm water
     2/3           cup  milk
     1/3           cup  butter -- softened
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
     2/3           cup  whole wheat flour
  2               cups  bread flour

Recipe adapted for ABM by jrjet@mtco.com -- Tested in a Farberware ABM with great results.

FOR ABM: Place wet ingredients in pan first, then add flour and dry ingredients - ending last with yeast. I baked this on light setting and it turned out wonderfully! Definitely a keeper!

TRADITIONAL: Dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar in warm water, stirring well; let stand 5 minutes or until bubbly.

Pour scalded milk over butter in a large mixing bowl; stir until butter has melted. Cool to lukewarm. Add remaining sugar, yeast mixture, salt and 4 eggs. Stir well. Gradually add whole wheat flour, beating well. Add enough bread flour to form a stiff dough.

Turn dough out on a floured surface; knead 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - 1 hour, 15 minutes.

Punch down,turn out and let rest on lightly floured surface -- 5 minutes resting. Divide dough into 3 parts; shape each portion into a round loaf. Place loaves on greased baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Combine egg yolk and whipping cream: mix well and lightly brush over the tops of the loaves. Cover and rise until doubled in bulk -- 1 hour.

Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes; reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake an additional 20 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cool on wire racks. Makes 3 round loaves.

* I don't know if the exchange information would be right for todays diabetic diet since things have changed since this recipe was published in what I believe to be somewhere between 1950 and 1970. I only included the exchange information because it was part of the recipe, and I thought it might be interesting to see how things have changed.

     1/4           cup  dark molasses
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  boiling water
  2        tablespoons  caraway seeds
     3/4           cup  warm water -- (105-115f)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  2               cups  rye flour
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg white
  2        tablespoons  water

                        caraway seeds -- and
                        kosher -- (coarse) salt

In a small bowl, combine the molasses, salt, melted butter, boiling water, and caraway seeds. Set aside.

Place warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. When yeast is dissolved and the molasses mixture is just warm, mix the two together. Pour into a large bowl and add the rye flour. Stir to mix thoroughly Turn out onto a floured surface and knead in the flour. Continue to knead until dough is glossy and elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel, and allow to rise to double its bulk in a warm, draft-free place; it should take about 1 hour. Punch down and divide dough into 20 balls of equal size. Roll each ball into a stick and place on greased cookie sheets. Allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400F degrees.

Combine egg white and water. Brush on each stick and sprinkle with caraway seeds and kosher salt.

Bake for approximately 20 minutes, or longer if you like them dry. Makes 20 sticks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 2/3           cups  Pace Picante Sauce (mild)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  cornmeal
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast

Put ingredients in your bread machine in the order suggested by the instruction booklet. Regular cycle. Some salsas have more liquid than others, so adjust as necessary.

Hand Method:
Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees). Mix in cornmeal and salsa until well blended. Stir in 2 cups of flour. Gradually add more flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl and is soft and not sticky. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes by hand or dough hook.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and put in a warm place until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch the dough down. Shape into a loaf and put in a 9 x 5 inch greased bread pan. Cover with plastic wrap and return to a warm place for about 45 minutes or until the dough has risen about 1" above the edge of the pan.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake about 35 to 40 minutes or until the loaf sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

Add a can of chopped chilies, if desired. 1 serving (1/12 of loaf): 169 calories, .5g fat, 0 cholesterol, 35g carbohydrate, 2g fiber, 4.5g protein, 240 mg sodium, 6mg calcium

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  bread flour -- (the gluten
                        makes a difference)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast -- (5 tsp)
  1 3/4           cups  very warm tap water
                        (120-130 degrees)
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  cold water
                        coarse salt -- (Kosher salt)
                        -- Morton makes it and it's in a blue box



In a large bowl thoroughly mix 1-1/2 cup flour, sugar, salt, and undissolved dry yeast. Gradually add tap water to dry ingredients and beat two minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 3/4 cup of flour. Beat at high speed two minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap. Now here's what I do to aid the rising process: Turn on the oven to its lowest setting and count slowly to 20. Turn OFF oven. Place towel on rack; place bowl containing covered dough to towel. Shut oven door and let rest 20 minutes.

Grease two cookie sheets and sprinkle with cornmeal.

Form the dough into breadsticks about 3/4" (Kids love this! They can gently roll, stretch and pull the breadsticks and love this, as they do braiding bread). Place the cookie sheets in fridge for two hours; remove. Preheat oven to 425F, placing a 10x15-inch jellyroll pan on the lowest shelf, and pour water into the pan. Beat egg white and water together; brush on breadsticks and sprinkle with coarse (kosher) salt. Bake 12-15 minutes. These freeze well and can be easily defrosted by microwaving about 30 seconds on medium setting.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           Cup  chopped and well-drained sauerkraut
                        -- (half of a 14.5-ounce can)
  1                Cup  water
  3        Tablespoons  olive oil
                        -- (I used extra-virgin)
  2        Tablespoons  light unsulphured molasses
  1 1/4      Teaspoons  salt
  2        Tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/4           Cups  Gold-n-White flour
                        -- (may substitute unbleached or bread
                        flour)
  1 1/4           Cups  pumpernickel rye flour
  1                Cup  whole wheat bread flour
  3        Tablespoons  gluten flour
     1/4           Cup  buttermilk powder
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  caraway seed
  2 1/2      Teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        -- or 2 teaspoons instant active dry yeast

Place all ingredients in bread pan in order listed, or in the order recommended for your machine. Set controls for whole wheat bread with medium crust and start machine. Makes one 1.5-pound loaf. NOTE: Because the moisture content of the sauerkraut may vary, you might have to add a bit more bread flour. Check the dough after about five minutes of kneading and if it is sticky and has not formed into a ball, sprinkle in more flour a tablespoonful at a time until it is firm enough.

     1/2           cup  roasted red bell pepper -- *   chopped & peeled

Preheat oven to 350F. Butter a 9in square pan. Lightly dust with additional flour and tap out excess. In a large bowl, stir together flours (or flour and cornmeal) sugar, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl stir together milk, eggs, and oil until blended. Make a well in center of flour mixture, add milk mixture and stir just to combine. Stir in sausage, cheese and red pepper. Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Remove pan to a wire rack. the bread is best served warm. Store completely cooled bread in an airtight container in refrigerator. TO reheat, toast a piece in a toaster oven or about 2 minutes, or until heated through.

*Link sausage can also be used. Simply remove casing before cooking sausage.

*To roast red pepper, cut in quarters and remove seeds. Place cutside down on a foil lined baking sheet. Broil for 8 to 12 minutes, or until charred. Tops of peppers should be approximately 3 to 5 inches from the heat source. Remove from sheet and cool. Rinse under cool running water to remove skin. Use a paring knife to remove remaining skin.

**Tootie Notes:I purchased a pan that has indentions in the shape of peppers. I bake this bread in the cast iron pan. It is so cute. I have played with this recipe in a lot of ways. Adding chopped chilies,
finely chopped pistachios and what ever. It is always, always welcome to the table with our cheese soup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***NORMA WRENN ***
  3               Cups  bread flour -- about
     3/4           Cup  gluten flour
  1          1/4 Ounce  Pa  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           Cups  tepid water
  4          Teaspoons  sugar -- divided
  1           Teaspoon  salt
  3        Tablespoons  Baking Soda -- (for the boiling
                        -- water)
  1         Tablespoon  coarse salt -- preferably sea
                        salt

In small bowl, combine 1/2 cup or tepid water with 1 teaspoon of the sugar and the yeast. Let rise until fluffy, about 10 minutes. Combine 1 cup of tepid water, the table salt, the gluten flour and 1 cup of the flour in the large bowl of an electric mixer; beat these ingredients until well-blended. Add the yeast mixture and beat on medium-low speed for four or five minutes. Stir in 1-1/2 cups more flour. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until very smooth and shiny, adding about 1/2 cup of flour as you knead. Form the dough into a ball and place it in an ungreased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in bulk, one hour or more. Punch down the dough, cut it into 12 equal pieces (I form a long log, cut it in half, and then cut it in half again, until I have 12 pieces). Cover with plastic wrap. Roll each piece to form a long rope about 16 to 18 inches long, with tapered ends. Form each into a pretzel shape and lay it on a lightly floured board. Let the pretzels rise until not quite doubled, about 30 minutes. In a 9-inch enameled or stainless-steel skillet, combine 1 quart of water, the baking soda and the remaining sugar. Bring to a simmer. Slide three pretzels at a time into this bath (I did one at a time); keep it at a bare simmer and cook the pretzels for 20 seconds on each side, flipping them gently with a skimmer. Then remove the pretzels with the skimmer, draining them onto a large parchment-covered baking sheet with their original topsides up. Sprinkle the pretzels sparingly with coarse salt. (I sprinkled heavily as we love salt). Bake the pretzels in the center of a preheated 425F oven for 15 minutes, or until nicely browned. Cool the pretzels to lukewarm and eat them fresh or wrap and freeze them after they have cooled completely.

                        sourdough starter
  1 1/4           Cups  warm water
  2               Cups  unsifted flour
     1/4           Cup  oil
  2        Tablespoons  sugar
  2          Teaspoons  salt
  1 1/3           Cups  warm water
  1            Package  yeast -- Optional
  5 1/2           Cups  Flour -- To 6 C

The night before (about 9 o'clock) empty all the starter into a large glass or crock bowl. Add 1-1/4 cup warm water and 2 cups unsifted flour. Mix well until smooth. Let stand overnight on counter with cloth cover. Put lid back on jar and do not wash. Next morning put 1 cup starter back into jar. Pour 1/2 cup sugar over it. Recap jar and store in refrigerator. With remaining starter in the bowl you will make the bread. To this starter add: 1/4 cup oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, 1-1/3 cup warm water, 1 package dry yeast (optional) 5-1/2 to 6 cups flour. Mix in order given and add 2 cups flour at a time and get to the last 1-1/2 cups and keep on adding flour and kneading until dough can be handled and not stick to hands. Pour a little oil into the same bowl, turning the dough once so the top will be oiled. Cover with cloth and let rise until double, (about noon). Pour dough out on bread board and cut into 3 equal pieces. Then knead each piece and squeeze out air, put into greased loaf pans. Cover with cloth and let rise until double. Preheat oven o 350F and bake 25 minutes, or until slightly brown. Never cook longer than this as it will dry out. Turn bread out of pans and turn right side up and butter each top. Cool slightly and put into plastic bag, and freeze while still warm. You can use your starter forever if you use it. Mine had been going 50 years. If you didn't want to make bread once a week, at least work your starter, by doing the night before thing, and the next morning when you fix your starter, throw away the rest. DON'T USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- starter
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar for sponge
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        flour

Mix all together, and let sit on your counter for 3 days with a loose fitting lid or cover with Saran wrap. On the third day stir it well. Let sit for two days more. Now some recipes call for adding 1 packet of yeast on the fifth day, that has been dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water. It sort of speeds the process of it getting sour. If you do add it then let the mix sit out for at least one more week and stir it each day. If you don't add it, you still have to let it sit out for the week, but, it may not be as sour the first few times you use it. I did not add the yeast. I just kept using it, and after the third or fourth time it was sour enough. Store the starter in the fridge. Now it will SEPARATE, into two parts, a darkish liquid on the top. This is NORMAL. Before you use it you stir the liquid back into the bottom part. Be sure to use a wooden spoon and do not let metal touch any part of the sour dough. Now to make the Sponge: 1/2 cup of warm water 1/2 cup starter mixed well 1 tsp sugar 1 tsp salt 1 1/2 cups of flour

Mix all very well in a glass bowl only and use only a wooden spoon, or plastic. Cover with Saran wrap and let sit over night. It will almost triple in size.

Now to FEED>>>>> To the starter add 1/2 cup warm water and 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp of sugar. Mix well. It will be bumpy and lumpy This is OK. Let it sit out with the lid loose overnight also. Then return to fridge for the next time. But, you have to wait at least 3 or 4 days between uses. To make the bread, to the "sponge" add the following and either use the electric mixer with dough hooks, or do it with the spoon and your hands.

1 pkg dry active yeast that has been proofed in 1/2 cup of warm water and 1 tsp sugar. Beat this into the sponge. Then add the flour 1/2 cup at a time and mix well. Keep adding until a firm dough is formed and is not very sticky. You will probably have to knead in the last 1/2 cup. Oil a bowl, place the dough in it and turn to coat. Cover and let stand for 1 1/2 hours. Punch down, and repeat for 45 min. Place corn meal on a cookie sheet. Turn out the dough on a floured board and knead for two min. Shape into a round ball and place on sheet. Make 2-3 slits on the top, and then cover and let sit for 1 hour. Brush with a beaten egg. Bake 35 min at 400F with a pan of water in the oven.

                Starter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  bread flour
  2               cups  skim milk
  2               tsp.  yeast

Mix the above in a ceramic, plastic, or glass bowl and let it sit at room temperature, covered, for 7 days. Place in the refrigerator thereafter. Use at least once every two weeks, and "feed" your starter with the same amount of water/milk and flour as the starter you use; i.e., if you use one cup of starter, feed the starter with one cup milk/water and one cup flour. The author of the above recommends alternating water with milk when you feed your starter. After feeding, let the starter sit at room temperature for 24 hours, then place again in the refrigerator. It may take a few weeks for the starter to be sour enough. If you want it to be more sour, add milk more often (or yogurt); less sour, add water more often.

This is richer and sweeter than most other breads. Plain or toasted it is outstanding.

Place all ingredients except the dried fruit in the machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bake the bread on the white bread cycle. Add the chopped fruit after the first kneading or according to the manufacturer's recommendation on when to make additions. When the baking is complete, remove the bread pan from the machine with potholders or oven mitts. Turn the pan upside down, and shake out the loaf. Place the bread on a wire rack to cool.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- 1 1/2 Lb Loaf:
  1 7/8           Cups  Spelt flour -- Arrowhead Mills
  1 7/8           Cups  Bread Flour
  2        Tablespoons  Honey -- Or
                        Natural Sweetener
  2        Tablespoons  Canola Oil

  1 3/8           Cups  Water -- room temperature
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  Red Star Yeast

 Mix ingredients in bread pan in order given except for yeast, which place in dispenser unit. Bake on whole wheat mode, at Rapid Bake Cycle.

Makes a 1-1/2 pound loaf.

NOTE: Spelt flour is very high in gluten, so the addition of vital gluten or gluten flour is not necessary. If used, use very sparingly - 1 teaspoon at a time until it is the way you want it. I don't recommend using any in this recipe.

Instructions for Panasonic 65. Alter as necessary for other machines.

                           Spiced Peaches Bread

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  2 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground mace
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- at room temperature
  2              large  eggs -- at room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  peaches -- * diced and peeled
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted, slivered almonds -- *

Preheat oven to 350F. Spray or butter and lightly dust a 9 x 5 x inch
loaf pan. In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, salt,
and spices. In a large bowl, with mixer, cream together sugar and
butter for 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy. One at a time, add
eggs, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla until blended.
 Stir in flour mixture just to combine. Stir in peaches and almonds.
Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 55 to 65
minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in center comes out clean.
Remove pan to a wire rack. Cool for 10 minutes before removing bread
from pan; finish cooling on rack. Store completely cooled bread in an
airtight container in refrigerator. Allow bread to reach room
temperature before serving.
*To remove peach skins, dip peaches into boiling water for 30 seconds
and then into ice water. Peel off skin with a small paring knife.
*TO toast almonds, pl;ace then in a single layer on a baking sheet
and bake at 350=B0 for 5 to 7 minutes, shaking a couple of times, until
nuts are lightly browned.
***Tootie Notes: I purchased a jar of spiced peaches, omitted the
spices and prepared as above. Be sure to drain the peaches well. This
turned out just dandy. Another little secret: bake in a bunt pan well
sprayed. Take enough of the spiced peach juice from the jar and mix
with powdered sugar to make a glaze. When bread is cool, poke holes
in the top with a toothpick and drizzle the glaze over the bread.
When it soaks into the bread, eat a piece and fall out dead. YUMMY!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
  4                cup  all purpose. flour or BREAD flour -- divided
  2               Tbsp  instant yeast
  3               Tbsp  sugar
  1                tsp  salt
  1 1/2            cup  warm water
  1                     egg
                        Me

Melt butter, set aside to cool. In a large mixer bowl, combine 1 3/4 c. flour with the other dry ingredients, stir well. Add water, with mixer on low, combine, then turn onto high and beat 3 min. Add egg and melted butter and beat for another 30 sec. Cover bowl with plastic and put aside in a very warm area for 20 min. Beat down the "sponge" with a large spoon. Put the dough hooks on your machine, or by hand, add 2 1/4 c. flour, kneading until you have a soft smooth dough. Add more flour if needed, but a slightly sticky dough is ok. Place dough in a lightly oiled large bowl, turning dough to cover it with a light coating of oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place 40 min.** Punch down. Let rest covered 10 min. (This makes it easier to work with) Divide dough in half. To do this, roll each dough half into a thick rope and slice into 9 - 12 equal pieces. Lightly oil you hands and roll each piece in your hand to shape into buns. Cover dough that you aren't working with, so it doesn't dry out. Place buns into 2 well greased 9 x 9 pans. Cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let rise in warm area until double in size. Bake in preheated oven at 375 deg. for 20 - 25 min. Lightly brush tops with butter when removed from oven. These freeze well. Thaw, then reheat to serve, if desired. ** If you are really short on time, you could omit this rising, but it may affect the texture.

NOTES : My whole house smells wonderful as this bread is baking right now. The
original recipe called for Roasted Red Peppers, but I made a "few" changes to
suit what I had on hand.

Substitute roasted red peppers for the tomatoes for the original recipe, and reduce the amount of fat in the recipe to 4 teaspoons margarine or butter, softened.

Categories    : Daily Bread Mailing List        Miscellaneous & Tips
                Yeast Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  salted roasted sunflower seeds
  1                cup  all-purpose flour plus
                        additional for dusting the dough
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into bits

In a food processor grind fine the sunflower seeds with 1 cup of the flour, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it just resembles coarse meal. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and toss it with 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water, or enough to just form a dough. Knead the dough lightly with the heel of the hand against a smooth surface, distributing the butter evenly, for a few seconds and form it into a ball. Dust the dough with the additional flour, flatten it slightly, and chill it, wrapped in waxed paper, for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Make the shells: Roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and with a 4 1/2 -inch round cutter cut out 6 round gathering and rolling the scraps as necessary. Press each round into a fluted metal tartlet pan, 3 1/4 inches across the bottom and 5/8-inch deep, prick the shells lightly with a fork, and chill them for 30 minutes or freeze them for 15 minutes. Line the shells with foil, fill the foil with the rice, and bake the shells in a jelly-roll pan in the lower third of the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the rice and foil carefully and bake the shells for 5 to 7 minutes more, or until they are golden. Let the shells cool in the pans on a rack. The shells may be made one day in advance and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

                        Sift together into a large bowl:
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  1               tsp.  baking soda
  1               tsp.  sea salt
  1               tsp.  baking powder
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        Add:
     1/2           cup  molasses or raw honey
     1/4           cup  polyunsaturated oil
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts or cashews
  1         tablespoon  grated orange rind

Stir everything together until combined. Pour into a loaf pan and let sit on the counter 20 minutes. Bake 375 for 45 minutes to an hour until tested done.

My Note: I have quite a few quickbreads recipes which advising sitting 20 minutes before baking. This process helps with the texture. If you use fresh and double acting baking powder, your quickbreads will still rise well when baked.

                        -- 1 1/2 Lb Loaf:
     1/2           Cup  Canned pineapple chunks -- well drained
     1/4           Cup  Buttermilk -- Or
  1               Tbsp  Dry Buttermilk
     1/4           Cup  Reserved pineapple juice
  1                     Egg
     1/2           Cup  Sliced banana
  3               Cups  Bread flour
     1/4           Cup  Whole wheat flour
  1           Teaspoon  Salt
  3        Tablespoons  Applesauce -- *Note
  1 1/2    Tablespoons  Sugar
     1/2           Cup  Shredded Coconut Meat
     1/3           Cup  Chopped macadamia nuts
     1/4      Teaspoon  Baking soda
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  Yeast

*NOTE: Original recipe used butter or margarine

Choose light crust...ADD INGREDIENTS ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN BY YOUR MACHINE'S MANUFACTURER. most machines have a cycle to add raisins and nuts after a certain period of time. if yours does, wait to add the fruit and nuts at that point. After baking is completed, remove from pan and wait 1 hour before slicing (if you can...LOL)

NOTES : My 7-1/2 year old son only likes "soft, white bread with no crust" and this is his favorite.

I do a couple of things differently, which may or may not work for your machine. I substitute 2 T of potato flour for the bread flour, add 1 t of lemon juice and I also find that I have to add additional liquid as the potato flour absorbs more moisture. It always turns out delicious, stays moist and I have also made this on the DOUGH cycle and made cinnamon swirl and other flavored breads. Hope you enjoy!!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              clove  garlic
  2        tablespoons  onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  oil from sun-dried tomatoes
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast -- (1 pkg) or
  1              small  cake fresh yeast
     1/4           cup  - warm water
  1                cup  - water -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  to 1/2 c oil-packed sun
                        dried tomatoes -- chop coarse
  3 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                     egg white -- beaten

Lightly saute the garlic and onion in the oil; let cool to room temp. Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 cup water and the garlic and onion with the oil, then stir in the tomatoes. Mix the flour and salt and stir 1 cup at a time into the yeast mixture. Knead on a lightly floured surface, sprinkling with 2 to 3 tablespoons additional flour as needed, until the dough is soft, velvety, and slightly moist, 8 to 10 minutes. BY MIXER: Stir the yeast into the warm water in a mixer bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Using paddle, stir in 1 cup water and the garlic and onion with the oil; then stir in the tomatoes. Stir in the flour and salt. Change to the dough hook and knead until soft, velvety, and elastic, about 3 minutes. The tomatoes will be distinct chunks. BY PROCESSOR: Stir the yeast into 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Place the flour and salt in a food processor fitted with the steel blade or dough blade and process briefly to sift. Place the garlic and onion with the oil and the tomatoes on top of the flour. With the machine running, pour the dissolved yeast and the 1 cup cold water through the feed tube as quickly as the flour can absorb it. Process until the dough comes together. Process 30 seconds longer to knead. The dough will be velvety, elastic and salmon colored. Finish kneading briefly by hand on a floured surface, if you want. 1st rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Shaping and second rise: Punch the dough down on a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Shape the dough into a ball. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet or a peel sprinkled with flour, cover with a towel, and let rise until doubled, about 45 to 55 minutes. Baking: Heat oven to 425~. If using a baking stone, turn the oven on 30 minutes before baking and sprinkle the stone with cornmeal just before sliding the loaf onto it. Make 3 parallel slashes on the top of the loaf with a razor. Brush the top with the egg white. Bake 10 minutes, spraying 3 times with water. Reduce the heat to 375~ and bake 25 to 30 minutes longer. Cool completely on a rack.

                          Using Proofing Baskets

Instructions for Use of Proofing Baskets
----------------------------------------
     >for the private household<

When new the proofing basket should be coated with a diluted paste of potato-, rye flour, and water. Before placing the dough in the proofing basket, the basket has to be dusted with potato-, rye-, or wheaten flour.

For a loaf without cracks in the crust place the smooth side of the kneaded dough upside down in the proofing basket.

After fermentation of the dough turn the proofing basket and place the dough on a flour-covered baking tin for immediate baking in the oven.

It is absolutely desired that inside the proofing basket - due to regular use - a flour coating builds up which, from time to time for hygienic reasons, should be removed. The proofing basket can be cleaned with water (no detergents).

Helpful Hints!

The proofing basket allows an especially soft dough. You can try a maximum quantity of water.

The most favorable temperature for fermentation is approx. 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) at an utmost high humidity {sic}.

The fermentation time is approx. 50 to 60 minutes. The longer the fermentation time (but moderate) the better the taste of the bread as far as the bread is not too flat.

Right before and after baking the dough resp. the loaf should be sprayed with water. This makes a better and shinier crust. Baking time is approx. 50 to 60 minutes (depending on the kind of bread). Start with a temperature of at least 220 degrees C (430 degrees F) and after 10 minutes lower the temperature to approx. 180 degrees C (350 degrees F). If possible let some water steam build up in the oven at the beginning of the baking time. And now - enjoy baking your bread,

  2               cups  or more (4 to 7 oz) shredded mixed cheese -- *


* Havarti, cheddar, mozzarella, muenster, gruyere

Make the dough in a bread machine using the dough cycle.

Stretch out dough starting at the edge to less than size of pizza pan. Try to keep most of the dough in the middle, not out at the edge. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes, covered. Stretch dough to fit pan. Pinch up rim. Let rise for 15 to 20 minutes.

Put fork holes all over dough. Bake dough 5 to 9 minutes (watch top) until off-white or light tan. Be sure that crust bakes enough or it will fall and be "doughy." Puncture with fork or flatten with spatula if it "blows up." Sprinkle wooden peel with corn meal.

Turn oven down to 400 F. Move crust to peel. Wipe off pan with paper towel and put it in oven, below the stone. Brush crust lightly with olive oil. Spread pizza sauce on crust, then rest of ingredients in order shown. Reserve most of cheese.

Slide pizza onto stone. Bake for 15 minutes. Spread rest of cheese on pizza and bake for 5 minutes more, a total of 20 minutes. Move to pan for slicing. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.

                            Vital Wheat Gluten

                Miscellaneous & Tips

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  bread flour

As discussed in other messages I've posted, gluten is the elastic net formed by kneading the hydrated proteins present in wheat flour. This elastic net then traps the carbon dioxide released by yeast fermentation of the sugars & starch in flour, causing the dough to rise.

You can isolate the formed gluten in a dough through a relatively simple, albeit slightly tedious procedure.

First, make a very simple non-yeast dough of flour & water (no salt or anything else, either.) Take 1/2 cup water (tepid or cool is fine) and knead in approximately 1 1/2 cups of bread flour. (All purpose will work, too, but won't yield as much gluten.) You then have to knead this dough extremely well. It doesn't really matter if it is a sticky or dry dough since you will be washing the starch out of it anyway. I used my KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough for at least about 5 or 6 minutes at high speed,

Start your kitchen sink faucet running with cool or tepid water at a medium-slow flow. Take the kneaded dough out of the bowl. In your hands, hold it under the flowing water, gently pressing it flat, turning it over, and moving it from hand to hand, squeezing gently. You will see a milky white residue flowing out with the water. This is the starch being washed out of the dough. You will need to continue this process, occasionally squeezing the dough back together, for probably 10 minutes or so.

The dough ball will get smaller & smaller as the starch is washed out. The dough will get rubberier and rubberier, reducing to about 20% of its original size, and the water will begin running clearer.

You will now have a very rubbery, elastic ball composed mostly of gluten. This can now be mixed in with another whole grain dough for added gluten. You can refrigerate or freeze it, or dry and powder it like commercial vital gluten.

Personally, I've never used vital gluten in my baking. However, I had an interesting discussion with another member of the list this weekend and thought it'd be an interesting experiment to make vital gluten again. Even if you don't plan to routinely make your own, it is a fascinating way to isolate and examine one of the most important components of yeast breads. It'll give you a whole new appreciation of the role proper gluten development plays in bread baking.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- Pizza Dough:
     3/4           cup  water
  1                tsp  sugar
  2                tsp  dry yeast
                        Seasonings:
     1/2           tsp  basil
     1/2           tsp  oregano
     1/4           tsp  rosemary
                        ---
  2               cups  white flour
                        -- (not bread flour)
  1                tsp  salt
  2               Tbsp  olive oil
  2               Tbsp  flour or semolina
                        -- if dough is too moist
                        ---
                        Olive oil (about 3 Tbsp)
                        ---
                        Topping:
  2                     boneless chicken half-breasts -- (10 to 14 oz)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  1                cup  fresh mushrooms -- (5 to 6) sliced
  1                tsp  salt
     1/4           tsp  pepper
  1                tsp  basil
  1                cup  cheddar cheese -- (4 oz) shredded
  1                cup  swiss cheese -- (4 oz) shredded

Can also add bok choy, sweet pepper

Make the dough in a bread machine using the dough cycle.

Slice chicken breasts thinly. Mix two types of shredded cheese together. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil skillet. Saute chicken, onions and garlic until chicken is cooked through. Add mushrooms, basil, salt and pepper, and cook another minute or two.

Stretch out dough starting at the edge to less than size of pizza pan. Try to keep most of the dough in the middle, not out at the edge. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes, covered. Stretch dough to fit pan. Pinch up rim. Let rise for 15 to 20 minutes.

Put fork holes all over dough. Bake dough 5 to 9 minutes (watch top) until off-white or light tan. Be sure that crust bakes enough or it will fall and be "doughy." Puncture with fork or flatten with spatula if it "blows up." Sprinkle wooden peel with corn meal.

Turn oven down to 400 F. Move crust to peel. Wipe off pan with paper towel and put it in oven, below the stone. Brush crust lightly with olive oil. Spread pizza sauce on crust, then rest of ingredients in order shown. Reserve most of cheese.

Slide pizza onto stone. Bake for 15 minutes. Spread rest of cheese on pizza and bake for 5 minutes more, a total of 20 minutes. Move to pan for slicing. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.

                Vegetable & Herb Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  lukewarm water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  honey
  2                     and 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
                        --
                        Dry Ingredients:
  1                cup  stone-ground whole-wheat flour
  1                cup  bread flour
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4          teaspoons  chile molido
                        -- (freshly ground pure chile powder)
  4          teaspoons  chile caribe -- (red pepper flakes)
                        ---
     1/2           cup  New Mexico green chile -- roasted, peeled
                        -- stemmed seeded and diced

1. Combine the water, olive oil, and honey in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer or a large mixing bowl.
2. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture, stir in , and let sit for 2 minutes. 3. Add the dry ingredients.
4. Mix with the dough hook (or knead by hand) for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the dough appears silky and resilient.
5. Mix or knead the green chile into the dough until thoroughly incorporated.(don't touch eyes while doing this!!) 6. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. 7. Let rise in a warm place for 1 and 1/2 hours, or until approximately doubled in volume.
8. Punch the dough down, re-cover with plastic wrap, and let rise again in a warm place for 30 minutes.
9. Place a baking stone on the middle rack in the over and preheat to 400 degrees.
10. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and cut into 2 equal pieces.
11. Grease two loaf pans or generously dust a baking sheet with whole-wheat flour.
12. Shape the dough into oblong loaves. Or, shape into two round loaves or 14 to 16 rolls.
13. Place the loaves in the prepared pans or on the baking sheet ( or place the rolls on the baking sheet), cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rise again in a warm place for 20 minutes. 14. Uncover the loaves and, using a spray bottle, spritz them with water and lightly dust with whole-wheat flour.
15. Make 2 or 3 diagonal slashes in the tops of the loaves with a serrated knife to allow the dough to expand in the hot oven. 16. Using the spray bottle, spritz the oven walls with water. Work quickly so the oven does not lose heat. (note: I would be careful of the steam) 17. Set the loaf pans or the baking sheet on the hot stone. 18. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (20 to 25 minutes for rolls). The bread is done when the crust is dark and firm and the loaves sound hollow when taped on the bottom.
19. Let the bread cool in the pans or on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. 20. Transfer the loaves (or rolls) to a rack and cool before cutting.

Bread Machine recipe:
1. Combine all the ingredients, except the green chile, in the bread pan in the order specified by the manufacture's instructions.
2. Process on the sweet or raisin bread setting (#8?).
3. Add the roasted chile at the beeps.

NOTES : Here is a recipe I thought you chile lovers might enjoy (hope it isn't too long). It is from "Flavored Breads: Recipes from Mark Miller's Coyote Cafe" Mark Miller says that this is a restaurant favorite. It's a handsome bread, with a red tinge to the crumb and red and green chile sparkles throughout. Vary the type of chile powder for a different effect; for example, substitute cayenne for the milder chile molido if you like fiery flavor; or use complex, smoky chipotle chile powder, which is available at Mexican markets. Chile caribe is the Spanish term for a fresher form of the dried red pepper flakes you commonly find on the table in Italian restaurants. This is an all-purpose bread that goes will with most kinds of southwestern foods. I don't think it would take much to make this healthier (maybe all whole wheat?)

                        -- or one egg - at room temp.
     1/4           cup  water
     3/4           cup  non-fat cottage cheese
     3/4           cup  plain non-fat yogurt

  3        tablespoons  onion -- minced dried
  2        tablespoons  whole dill seed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil -- - or butter

Warm together the water; cottage cheese, yogurt, sugar, onion, dill seed and oil in microwave for about 30 seconds or until warm to the touch (about 110 deg). Set aside. Place all other ingredients above into the bread pan in order listed. Add warmed ingredients. Select white bread setting (other brands of B/M's may have a whole wheat setting), but the white bread setting works on the DAK. Set light/dark setting on side of B/M to 11 o'clock. Press Start. Open lid after dough has kneaded about 2 mins. Press dough lightly with fingertip. If wet, sticky dough adheres to your fingertip OR dough is not forming into one soft ball (NO sticky dough on bottom of pan), add 1 Tablespoon or more flour until dough is just slightly tacky and makes one soft ball of dough.

  3        Tablespoons  honey
  3        Tablespoons  Butter Buds=AE
     1/4           Cup  wheat germ
  5 1/2           Cups  Whole Wheat Flour -- about
     3/4      Teaspoon  baking powder
  1 3/4      Teaspoons  salt -- omitted used

  2                     Egg

In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in milk, honey, shortening, and wheat germ. Using a wooden spoon or electric mixer, gradually mix in 3-1/2 cups of the flour. Beat until dough pulls away from sides of bowl in stretchy strands. Cover and let stand in a warm place until light and bubbly (about 40 minutes). Meanwhile, combine 1-1/2 cups of the flour with the baking powder and the 1-3/4 teaspoons salt; set aside. Punch dough down and stir in flour mixture. Turn onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth (about 5 minutes), adding flour as needed to prevent sticking. Divide kneaded dough into 4 equal portions. Cut each quarter into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece into a rope about 24 inches long. Cut in half and twist each half into a pretzel. Place pretzels, slightly apart and with loose ends turned under, on well-greased baking sheets (at least 12 by 15 inches). Brush pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with coarse salt (omitted). Bake in a preheated 400~ oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden; transfer to a rack. After all pretzels have been baked, turn oven off. Pile baked pretzels onto 2 ungreased baking sheets and set in turned-off oven for 2 to 3 hours or overnight, until thoroughly dried (break one to test).

In an English family Yorkshire pudding is a must with a roast beef. Egg and milk batter is poured over the meat drippings and rises to a high, puffy crust. One of the secrets for a perfect Yorkshire pudding is a hot oven.
This recipe comes from a Nebraska homemaker; it is her husband's favorite and dates back to his great grandmother. Every successive daughter-in-law was taught to make this crispy accompaniment to the roast. Half the family prefers the pudding slathered with softened butter, and the other half pour on a generous ladling of rich brown gravy.

Tastes like a huge popover...crusty brown with a moist center.
