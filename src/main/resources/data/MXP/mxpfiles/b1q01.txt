*Okay--now this *isn't* the Amish friendship bread that has the starter.
*If you let a bread machine do the kneading, put the yeast in first, then the sugar/honey and salt, the rest of the dry ingredients, then the wet ingredients.

**Dissolve yeast in 1/2 c water with a pinch of the sugar. In large bowl, combine sugar, salt, water and butter. Add yeast mixture. Gradually add flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto floured surface and knead until smooth. Place in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise about 2 hours, or until doubled. Punch down. (This would be the time to do your third rising) Divide into two portions and form loaves. Place in greased bread pans. Prick tops with fork (I never do this and it comes out just fine). Let rise in warm place until higher than pans (about 2 hours). Bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Butter tops of loaves (I also never do this because I'm trying to cut back a little on fat). Place pans on sides until loosened. Remove bread and cool completely.

I finally made this bread to check it out. My husband, who doesn't get enough white bread from me :), pronounced it delicious. I find it to be a very good basic white bread with a nice close grain.

I made it with Gold Medal Unbleached All-Purpose flour, and used unsalted butter. I keep my yeast and flour in the freezer, so they were pretty cool when I mixed the dough. I used Fermipan Brown yeast, but I doubt the brand of yeast made much difference in the outcome. I mixed the dough in my trusty Hobart KitchenAid mixer. I also baked it longer than your recipe calls for, but my oven thermostat is all messed up, so don't go by me for that!

I found that it did not take two hours to rise. It could be that you are letting the dough rise too long and it is "over-proofing." The large holes and the falling in the oven are symptoms of over-proofing. Only let the dough rise until double in bulk, or until depressions made by touching the dough lightly with two fingers stay, and don't spring back.

In short, it worked fine for me! I don't know what more to tell you! [Paul and Ruth Provance <prmtprovance@erols.com>]

I have a wonderful, easy sticky bun recipe from " Eat, Drink, and be Chinaberry" (the best cookbook I own, and I own hundreds...you can buy it
from chinaberry.com, I think).

Grease a 9 x 13 pan. Spread chopped nuts on the bottom of the pan. Slice bread dough in half lengthwise, and then chop into pieces about 1 inch thick.
 Lay pieces of dough on top of nuts in single layer (remember the dough will rise and fill in the gaps).

In a bowl, mix the pudding mix, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and milk. Spread mixture over bread.

Allow bread to rise overnight on the kitchen counter (or even in a cold oven that you'll just turn on in the morning). In the morning bake for 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees.

Yum!

This Recipe is for Shanda she asked for a "Really good, gooey, fingerlicking, don't-even-talk-to-me-about-calories, STICKY BUNS?!" recipe. Well here it is. I would like to put a disclaimer on these I only make them 2 or 3 times a year. If you made them any more than that the chances of Cardiac Arrest are more than I care to tackle. You may want to invite you pastor/priest over when you make these. They are Devilish, I mean straight demonic. Enough said, here is the recipe.

I adapted this from "The Coffee Book" by Christie and Thomas Katona


*   (I recommend bread flour since there is so much butter and sugar,
all-purpose will not rise as well.)
**   (Please don't make this more than 4 times a year I don't want to take
responsibility for anyone's death.)
*** (freshly squeezed is a solar system apart from pre-made oj in this recipe)

Dough:
Add yeast to lukewarm water along with dash sugar to proof.  Combine buttermilk, sugar, salt, soda and cooled butter in a bowl.  When the yeast has proved itself add to ingredients in bowl along with 2 C. of the flour beat very well.  Slowly add more flour till it is too tough to mix by hand.  turn out and knead till it is smooth.  Place in a clean oiled bowl to rise 15 minutes.

Filling:
3/4 C. butter melted. (more demons)
2 C. brown sugar,**
2 tsp. cinnamon
zest of one orange

Combine filling ingredients.  Roll Dough out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle bout 10x18 in.  Spread filling on dough.  Roll up lengthwise (you should have a roll 18 in. long when you are done). Cut into 12 pieces 1 1/2 in. each (I use dental floss to cut them trust me).  Place cut side up in a buttered 9x13 in. pan.  Let rise 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Bake rolls for 10 to 15 (I bake them from 15 to 20),  until golden brown.  Turn upside down onto a serving platter.  Glaze if desired.  Serve warm.

Glaze:

4 oz. butter
1 package cream cheese
2 C. powdered sugar
juice of 2 oranges,***

Combine butter and cream cheese until creamy add powdered sugar.  Add FRESHLY squeezed oj until it is the consistency desired and enjoy.

These are too good for words.  Enjoy.

P.S. Please eat responsibly

Perfect Bread
How To Conquer Bread Baking
by Betsy Oppenneer

This is a video tape that is wonderful!! I used to make bread by hand when my daughters were young. But I sure wish I had this tape then to not only learn how to make it correctly by hand but to learn some of Betsy's secrets. This is a very good tape for beginning bakers but bakers who have been baking by hand can pick up some tips/tricks also. I know that I will watch this tape more times so that I can learn even more. Jeff watched it also and wanted to try making some by hand. When our house remodel is completed (June or if we get our kitchen back before then) he is going to give it a try. I asked my daughter, Susan, to review the tape also .... she has never made a hand made loaf till now. She made the white bread recipe below and it turned out very, very well!! She learned a lot from the tape and chose to attempt this method.


Directions are in the video.

Here is another review by another friend of mine, Leigh, who has been making bread for many years also. Here is her review of this tape...

>Okay, so I watched the first video on making bread. I've been making bread >off and on for close to thirty years now, and figured I would be fast >forwarding through much of it. Imagine my surprise when I actually learned >several new things! The whole family ended up watching it with me.

I have been experimenting with machines for a few years now and have some ideas that improve the flavor and texture of the bread.

1. use filtered, bottled or preboiled (morning teapot leftover is great) water. It seems that the chlorine in some water supplies makes the yeast unhappy.

2. add 1 tsp of vinegar (I use apple cider) to the water.

3. let the water, yeast (I use smaller amounts than most recipies: usually 1 tsp total), vinegar, and one cup of the flour mixed together, ferment for 1/2 to 6 hours before mixing in rest of ingredients. Whole wheat, rye or a mixture of these works great.

4. weigh the flour in a cheap food scale rather than measure: 1c = 4oz

5. Let the bread sit in the pan for 30 to 60 minutes after the baking cycle is through. Then let the bread dry on a rack. The crust will be thick, crisp and chewy.

                        ***FILLING***
  1 1/2           cups  chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  chopped maraschino cherries -- plus
                        extra cherries for the top -- halved
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
                        cooking spray
                        ***ICING***
                        confectioner's sugar
                        milk
                        vanilla extract

Dissolve yeast in warm water in 2 1/2-quart bowl. Stir in milk, sugar, butter, salt, egg and 2 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased 2 1/2-quart bowl; turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.) Punch down dough.

Mix chopped walnuts, chopped cherries and sugar. Roll dough into oblong, 15 x 9". Spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter and walnut mixture. Roll up tightly, beginning at wide side. Seal well by pinching edges of roll together to make a ring. Even up roll by stretching slightly.

Place roll, sealed edge down, on a baking sheet that has been lightly covered with cooking spray. Pinch edges together. With scissors, make cuts 2/3 of the way through the ring at 1" intervals. Turn each section on its side (face up). Let rise until double, about 30 to 40 minutes. (Or let rise in refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours, or until doubled in size.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake 25 to 30 minutes.

When ring has cooled somewhat, mix confectioner's sugar and milk to spreading consistency. Add vanilla. Spread over ring and decorate with extra cherry halves.

This recipe is a conglomeration of recipes from various Betty Crocker Cookbooks and a Fleischmann's Yeast booklet.

NOTES : I'm a recipe follower, usually. But I wanted to make a Swedish Tea Ring over the holidays that had cherries, or some Christmasy look, and couldn't find a recipe. So, I combined a few recipes and made the following. It was very good. I let it rise overnight, baked it in the morning and took it to work. Despite the cold winter weather, and the 26 mile drive to work, it was still warm. No one waited until break time, but gobbled it up right away.

  1                cup  cool water
  1                tsp  yeast
  1                cup  whole wheat -- (4oz)
     1/4           cup  rye -- (1oz)
  1                tsp  apple cider vinegar
                        -----
  1                cup  bread flour -- (7oz)
  1                 tb  gleuten
  2                tbs  dry skim milk -- (Carnation)
  1                tsp  salt
  1                 tb  light olive oil
                        -- (does not flavor the bread)
  1                 tb  honey -- *

* (I use the tablespoon measure right after the oil so the honey slips right out.)

Mix first ingredients together and cover (I use a shower cap lifted from a hotel), and let sit at room temp for 6 hours.

I use the Breadman that has been programmed to kneed 15 min, rise 30 punch down then rise 1.5 hours, bake 375 for 50 min. Let sit in pan another 30 min then cool completely. If you have machine that cannot be programmed, use warm water instead of cool (30 sec in microwave) and the dark setting. If you want the timed setting, put the bread flour and the other ingredients on top of the fermenting wheat/rye and the oil and honey on top of that. Do not cover with plastic which would be truely interesting baked into your bread.

This makes a Thick chewy crusted bread with a soft crumb that is stringy, not cakey, and smells great.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- 105F -115 F.
  2        tablespoons  light molasses -- (unsulphured)
  1         tablespoon  melted butter or vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  nonfat dry milk
  2        tablespoons  wheat germ
  2               cups  whole wheat -- up to 2 1/2 cups
                        Milk to brush over top
                        Rolled oats to sprinkle over top

MAKES 1 LOAF

In the old days, bread such as this was baked in quantity on flat stones in an open fire or in a wood-fired brick oven. Although our baking methods today are more streamlined and bread baking is as easy as mixing up a cake, the goodness of this earthy bread remains the same. This bread has no white flour in it at all.

NOTE: Ingredients list molasses but directions indicate honey. Use molasses.

In large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; add honey and let rest 5 minutes until yeast foams. Stir in butter, salt, dry milk, wheat germ, and half the flour. Add remaining flour slowly to keep dough smooth. Let rest 15 minutes. Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead for 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wash bowl, grease it; add dough to bowl, turn over to grease top, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Cover a baking sheet with parchment or lightly grease it. Punch dough down and shape into a ball. Place ball on prepared sheet and roll or pat into a circle about 8 inches in diameter. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush top of loaf with milk and sprinkle generously with oats. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack.

NOTES : Recently someone asked how to keep their bread from deflating when they carefully brush the top. I don't know the answer, but this bread deflated at that point. Then it didn't rise as much as expected in the oven. Note that molasses is in the ingredients, but the directions refer to honey. I used molasses.

This bread was tasty and easy to make. I liked the fact that it made just one loaf.

Makes 2 loaves*

This recipe comes from Libbys (solid pack pumpkin). The sharp, sour cranberries are the perfect foil for the sweetened, pumpkin bread. The deep red of the cranberries contrasts beautifully with the bright, orange pumpkin. It's a snap to make, good looking,, tastes yummy and freezes well...a real winner.


Combine eggs, sugar, oil, and pumpkin; mix well. Combine flour, pie spice, soda and salt in large bowl; make well in center. Pour pumpkin mixture into well; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in cranberries. Spoon batter into 2 greased and floured 8x4 inch loaf pans. Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

*Since I prefer a larger loaf, I double the recipe, but then pour mixture into 3 - 9x5 inch pans. These may need to bake a tad longer
**I substitute 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each ground ginger and nutmeg for the pie spice

In a small saucepan cook cranberries and the 3/4 cup sugar, covered, over low heat just till mixture starts to form juice, stirring occasionally. Uncover and heat to boiling, stirring frequently. Boil gently, uncovered, about 5 minutes or till berries pop. Stir in nutmeg. Divide cranberry mixture evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Set aside. In a medium bowl combine flour, the 1/3 cup sugar, nuts, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl combine egg, milk, cooking oil, and lemon peel. Add to flour mixture all at once. Stir just till moistened (batter should be lumpy). Spoon batter on top of the cranberry mixture in the muffin cups, filling each cup 2/3 full. Bake in a 400F oven about 20 minutes or till golden. Cool in muffin cups on a wire rack for 5 minutes. To remove muffins from muffin cups, invert muffins onto the wire rack. Makes 12.

Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl; cut in butter with two knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cranberries and orange peel; toss well. Add yogurt, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened (dough will be quite sticky). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and with well-floured hands, knead 5 or 6 times. Pat dough into an 8-inch circle on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Cut dough with sharp knife into 12 wedges (DO NOT SEPARATE wedges). Sprinkle the 2 tsp. of sugar over the dough. Bake at 450F for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.

Another way to add steam to the oven when baking bread is to bake something else simultaneously that generates steam.
Examples are to roast butternut squash or pumpkin, or bake a panful of apples stuffed with raisins and other good things. Unpeeled potatoes that have been sliced into lengthwise eighths can be tossed with extra virgin olive oil, seasoned with dried oregano and sea salt, and roasted until crispy and golden. All of these can go in the oven at temperatures from 350 to 400 or so, so they are relatively accomodating, yet lend their moisture well, and you end up with another dish to serve along with your fresh bread.

When I do this, there is so much steam billowing from the vent of my convection oven that it would be quite easy to get a steam burn if you held your hand atop the vent! [Frank.Yuhasz@pentairpump.com]

---
I bake alomst every day, and I have discovered that baking a tray of bread at the same time as (and above) a tray of oven-chips (french-fries to the American-English) has the same effect as fiddling about with ice-cubes. The non-stick tray I use for the bread doesn't cover either the length or the width of the oven (it sits on a wire rack that does), so the steam from the frozen potato has room to slip past the edges and steam-bake the bread. I put both trays in the oven at the same time, with the bread done in about 12-15 minutes and the chips five minutes later. *And* I can serve hot, fresh bread with the food. ["C.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         tbsp.  dried yeast
  1               tsp.  sugar
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
  1                cup  warm milk
  1                cup  warm water
  1              tbsp.  salt
  2              tbsp.  veg. oil
     1/2          tsp.  baking soda
  1                cup  pastry flour
  3               cups  all-purpose flour

The first crumpets I made were from The Great Canadian Bread Book, by  Janice Murray Gill

Proof the yeast with the sugar in the lukewarm water. Combine the warm milk (do not scald the milk for crumpets) and the warm water, add the oil and the proofed yeast. Mix the salt and the flour in a warm bowl and stir in the liquids. Beat very well by hand or, better, with electric mixer. Cover and leave to rise in a warm place until the mixture has risen and is very bubbly. Dissolve the baking soda in a little warm water, about 1/4 cup, and stir down into the batter. Cover and leave it in a very warm, 90 F. place for about 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, heat a heavy cast-iron or aluminum griddle, keeping the temp. low. Grease the insides of crumpet rings. (I use 4 in. crumpet rings, about an inch deep, or a comparable cookie cutter.) Pour the batter half way up the rings, and cook until bubbles appear and the tops are dry. (I usually poke the bubbles with a wooden skewer to help the holes form.) Be patient, this takes about 10 minutes. Turn the crumpets over, slip off the rings, and bake 2 or 3 minutes, until just pale brown.

I prefer crumpets toasted, but Ms. Gill agrees with Elizabeth David who just keeps them warm and then slathers them with butter.

  3               cups  or so unbleached all-purpose flour
  1               tsp.  dry yeast
                        -- (1/2 oz. fresh)
  2 1/2           cups  milk and water -- mixed
                        -- a generous measure
  1              tbsp.  salt
  1               tsp.  sugar
  2              tbsp.  oil
                        Second Mixing
     1/2          tsp.  baking soda
     2/3           cup  warm water -- or a little more

Here is the Elizabeth David version of crumpets.  If you don't have her book, English Bread and Yeast Cookery, you should try to get it.


Warm the flour in an earthenware bowl in a low oven for 5 minutes. Warm the oil, milk, water and sugar to blood heat. Use a little of this to cream the yeast. (I proofed active dry yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.) Mix the salt with the warm flour, stir in the yeast, pour in the liquid, and stir the batter very well and vigorously, until it is smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl, leave batter to rise at room temp. until the whole surface is a mass of bubbles and the mixture looks as if it were about to break. This will take 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Forestall the natural falling of the batter by beating it down yourself with a wooden spoon. Dissolve the baking soda in the warm water and stir it into the bowl. Cover the bowl and leave the batter to recover, for about 30 minutes. This time, put it in a rather warmer place, unless you need to delay the cooking of the crumpets, in which case use cold water for dissolving the soda and remove the bowl of batter to a cool place.

To cook the crumpets, grease the griddle very lightly, also the crumpet rings. Put 4 rings on the griddle, pour enough batter into each to come almost to the top. Let them cook very gently, 7 to 10 minutes. By this time there should be a mass of tiny holes. If the holes haven't appeared, the batter is too thick. Add more warm water or milk to the batter before cooking the next batch.

Once the crumpets have set, it should be easy to slip off the rings and turn them over. They only need 3 minutes on the other side.

Note: I used a non-stick, electric frying pan at no hotter than 275 deg. F. I also wound up adding almost 1/3 cup more warm water to the batter. They don't rise very much, but they are the best crumpets I have ever eaten.

                        Combine in a mixing bowl:
  1                cup  water
     2/3           cup  scalded milk
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt

Dissolve 1 package active dry yeast in 2 tablespoons of warm water for 5 minutes.

Combine the two mixtures.

Beat 2 cups of all-purpose flour into the above mixture. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1-1/2 hours, or until it collapses back into the bowl.

Beat in 3 tablespoons of softened butter.

Beat or knead in 2 more cups of all-purpose flour.

Grease the inside of 8 muffin/crumpet rings and place them on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Fill the rings half full of the batter and let stand, covered, until the dough has doubled in bulk. It should now fill the ring.

Place the cookie sheet in a 425F preheated oven and bake until the crumpets are golden brown.

Cool slightly on a rack and then remove the rings.

Makes 8 crumpets.

If you have only 4 rings, chill or freeze half the dough before it rises and bake in two batches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 1/2              C  Bread Flour -- To 6 1/2 C
  1                Pkg  Active Dry Yeast
  2 1/2              C  Water
     3/4             C  Golden Raisins
     3/4             C  Whole Wheat Flour
  2 1/2            Tsp  Salt
     3/4             C  Coarsely Chopped Toasted Walnuts
     3/4             C  Coarsely Chopped Hazelnuts
                        Water

This recipe uses Pillsbury Flour.

Recipe Fact: This recipe is inspired by the little raisin-walnut rolls sold in Parisian boulangeries. Nourishing, just sweet, and with a bit of nutty crunch, these rolls are perfect at breakfast. They also make a nice tea-time snack. Bake them for guests who don't care for sugary pastries.

Kitchen Tip: To simulate the steamy interior of a boulangerie oven, place several ice cubes in a shallow pan. Set the pan on the lowest oven rack beneath the rolls. Shut the oven door and let steam give the rolls more spring. The initial moisture, followed by dry heat once the ice cubes have evaporated, will make the crust extra crunchy.

Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In med bowl, combine 2 C of the bread flour and yeast; mix well. Stir in 1 1/2 C of the warm water to form a loose starter dough. Let rest 15 - 30 min. In small bowl, combine raisins and remaining 1 C warm water. Let stand 15 min.

Meanwhile, grease cookie sheets. In large bowl, combine 3 1/2 C of the remaining bread flour, whole wheat flour and salt; mix well.

Stir raisins with water into starter dough until well mixed. Add starter mixture to whole wheat flour mixture; stir until soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto floured surface; knead 10 - 12 min, adding 1/2 - 1 C flour until dough is smooth and elastic. Dough will be slightly sticky. Knead walnuts and hazelnuts into dough.

Spray large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Place dough in sprayed bowl; cover loosely with sprayed plastic wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80 - 85F) until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hrs.

Punch down dough several times to remove all air bubbles. Divide dough into 18 pieces. Shape each piece into ball; place on greased cookie sheets. Cover; let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hr.

Heat oven to 425F. Uncover dough; brush tops of rolls lightly with water. Bake at 425F for 17 - 22 min or until golden brown.

  2                Pkg  Yeast
                        Rapid Rise Is Good
  1                Tsp  Sugar
  1                  C  Warm Water
  3               Tbsp  Olive Oil
  2                     Eggs
  1 1/2            Tsp  Baking Powder
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  1               Tbsp  Splenda
  1 1/3              C  Bobs Red Mill Vital Wheat Gluten Flour
     1/3             C  Soy Flour
     1/2             C  Oat Flour
     1/4             C  Flax Seed Meal
     1/4             C  Coarse Unprocessed Wheat Bran

Made sure ingredients were room temp. Put warm water, eggs, sugar and olive oil in bottom of bread machine. Mixed dry ingredients except for yeast and put in next. Then make a well in the dry ingredients and put the yeast in. Shut the lid, set the bread maker for the shortest bake cycle (mine has a 58 minute express cycle so that's what I used) When the dough was kneaded the first time (think it was about 12 minutes) I removed the dough, split it in half and put one ball in a greased bread pan and let sit in my warmed oven to rise for 45 minutes, then baked at 380F for 20 minutes. THIS TURNED OUT GREAT.

I returned the other ball of dough to my bread machine, after removing the paddle, and let the machine complete its cycle. Although this loaf was quite tasty, it was much smaller than the one I let rise and baked in the regular oven.

Gabi, this bread is soooooo good....I can't imagine not having this recipe!

Laurie's notes:

You should get 16 slices per loaf. As far as carb counts go, I'm not completely sure because the original recipe had used slightly different amounts: 1 c wheat gluten flour, 1/4 c oat flour, 3/4 c soy flour, 1/4 c flax seed meal, and 1/4 cup coarse unprocessed wheat bran along with 1 pkg. yeast, 1/2 tsp. sugar, 1 1/8 c water, 3 Tbsp. Olive Oil, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt, and 1 Tbsp. artificial sweetener.

The carb count using those amounts was 72.5 gr.carbs and 24.25 grams of fiber. Subtract the fiber and you end up with 2.99 carbs per slice. (For 16 slices per loaf). If you substitute the oat flour with soy flour and the bran with flax seed meal, you get a loaf with 64 carbs and 24 grams of fiber that works out to 2.5 carbs per slice.

If you can't do soy, substitute the soy with oat flour and use only the flax seed meal (or the bran if you want.) The loaf with all flax will have 72.5 carbs and 14.75 grams of fiber. That works out to 3.6 carbs per slice.

Those carb counts were for the old recipe. Gabi said she got two loaves of bread from her new recipe with the two eggs in it, so the carb count per slice would only be about 1 gram. Maybe someone can double check the carb counts.

  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Cooking spray

We got such a great response to last week's bread recipes, we thought you
might like another one. This one's great for PBJ's.

Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water; let stand 5 minutes. Place 2 cups all-purpose flour and next 5 ingredients (all-purpose flour through salt) in a food processor; pulse 4 times. Add margarine; process 10 seconds. With processor on, slowly add yeast mixture and 2/3 cup water through food chute; process until combined. With processor on, add 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour through food chute, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough leaves sides of bowl and forms a ball. Process 15 additional seconds.
Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down; divide into 3 equal portions. Working with one portion at a time (cover remaining dough to keep from drying), shape each portion into a 12-inch rope. Place 3 ropes lengthwise on a large baking sheet; pinch ends together at one end to seal. Braid ropes; pinch loose ends to seal. Place in an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan immediately; cool on a wire rack. Yield: 16 servings (serving size: 1 slice).


Bread Machine Variation: Increase second listing of water from 2/3 cup to 1 cup; follow manufacturer's instructions for placing all dough ingredients in bread pan. Select cycle, and start bread machine.

  4                     egg whites
                        -- (or 2 whole eggs)

Makes 24

This recipe comes from one of Diane Mott Davidson's mystery novels. Unfortunately, I can't remember which one, but they are all good reads and the recipes are often inspired. These muffins may remind you of cranberry orange relish, but they are oh so sophisticated. As rich as they taste, they are actually low in cholesterol. They are a Thanksgiving morning tradition at my house.


Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the orange juice, the Grand Marnier, and the oil; set aside while you prepare the batter. In a large bowl, combine the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and orange zest. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. Combine the juice mixture with the beaten egg whites. Add the egg mixture and the cranberries to the flour mixture, stirring just until moist. Using a 1/4 cup measure, divide the batter among 24 muffin cups that have been fitted with paper liners. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown and puffed.

*I prefer to mince the candied orange peel that they sell around the holidays and substitute several teaspoons of that for the orange zest

  2 1/4           cups  unbleached bread flour -- (2 1/4 to 2 1/2)
                        -- or unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  stone-ground white cornmeal
     1/4           cup  fresh corn kernels
                        -- (1 large ear)
                        or frozen whole kernel corn -- thawed
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  2               Tbsp  honey
  2               Tbsp  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt

For poolish, in a large mixing bowl combine the 1-1/4 cups flour and the yeast; stir in the 3/4 cup water. This will form a thick batter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let ferment until it is bubbly and doubled, about 2 hours.

For bread dough, stir the 2/3 cup warm water into the poolish. In another large mixing bowl combine the 2-1/4 cups flour, the cornmeal, and corn. Add poolish, eggs, honey, oil, and salt. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it forms a stiff batter. (If batter seems thin, stir in the remaining flour.)

Place the dough in a large bowl; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough ferment until it is light and doubled in size, about 1-1/2 hours.

Stir dough down. Generously grease two 8 x 4 x 2-inch baking pans. Spread half of the dough in each prepared pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

Bake in a 350 F oven for 40 minutes or until bred is golden brown and sounds hollow when lightly tapped with fingers. (If necessary, cover loosely with foil the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning.) Loosen and remove loaves from pan, cool on a wire rack.

YIELD: Makes 2 loaves.

In digest v101.n014 there was a recipe for a "High Rise Cornbread" The SALT measurement is WAY OFF ! The recipe said" 1 TB," (instead of 1 tsp)

I converted the recipe to the bread machine(dough stages) and oven baking stone. And I have to tell you, it is a REMARKABLE loaf !!!!!!!!! [MLroses@webtv.net (ML)]

You can get a great recipe for Malasadas as well as a little information on why Malasadas are traditionaly made on Fat Tuesday every year. Malasadas were brought to Hawaii by the Portuguese inmigrants who came to work in the sugar fields over a hundred years ago, and have now crossed all cultural and ethnic lines in the islands.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- (1 1/2 lb recipe)
     3/4           cup  milk
  2              large  eggs
  1               TBSP  water
     1/4           cup  butter -- at room temp cut
                        into small pieces
     1/3           cup  mixed peel
     1/2           cup  currants
  1                tsp  salt
     1/2           tsp  allspice
  1                     egg white
  3 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  2                tsp  bread machine yeast
  3               TBSP  sugar
  1 1/2            tsp  cinnamon
     1/2           tsp  nutmeg
                        ICING (opt)
  1                cup  icing sugar
  2               TBSP  milk -- (approx)

Place milk, eggs, butter, salt, flour, sugar, spices & yeast into bread machine pan in the order suggest in your manual. Process on the dough cycle.
When the cycle is complete, transfer dough to lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle. Knead in currants & peel.
Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball & place on large greased baking sheet. Cover & let rise in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 15 - 20 minutes. lightly beat together egg white & water: brush over tops of buns. If you don't want to add icing to your buns, at this point, cut a cross into the top of them. For a decadent touch you can use marzipan to form a cross now - be warned that marzipan grows when it bakes so use a very stingy log ( 1/8-inch ). Put the marzipan on top of the egg-wash so it will stick.
 Bake at 375F for 15 to 18 minutes ( my oven does them in 12 to 15 minutes ) or until done. Remove from baking sheet & cool on rack. ICING - In a small bowl, mix icing sugar & enough milk to make icing of desired consistency. Pipe on in the form of cross on each or smooth over the top if marzipan used.

NOTES : This recipe was in our local daily paper a couple of years ago. The dough is easy to work with & fairly forgiving - the mentally challenged ladies I work with love to help make these. For those with a 1 lb machine, I hope that you have discovered & taken advantage of the fact that with dough you can make recipes 1/2 a pound larger than the stated capacity of the machine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1                     yeast cake
                        -- [I used 2-1/4" Instant Dry Yeast]
                        -----
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  4       Tablespoons.  powdered milk
     1/2    teaspoons.  salt
     1/4    teaspoons.  freshly grated nutmeg
                        -----
  4                     eggs
  4       Tablespoons.  sugar
                        -----
  2       Tablespoons.  vegetable oil
     1/2    teaspoons.  lemon extract
     1/4             c  water
                        -- or t. or T water

HAND MIXING METHOD:
Combine and let stand:
  1/2 cup warm water
  1 yeast cake
- [I used 2-1/4" Instant Dry Yeast]

Mix together in a bowl
  2-1/2 cups flour
  4 T. powdered milk
  1/2 t. salt
  1/4 t. freshly grated nutmeg

Beat together
  4 eggs
  4 T. sugar

Mix all above ingredients with these in a large bowl and let rise for 2  hours. Stir again just before frying.

2 T. vegetable oil
1/2 t. lemon extract
1/4 c or t. or T water

FRYING:
Drop batter from the end of a spoon in small spoonfuls into oil heated to about 375 F. When brown, drain on paper towels and shake in a bag with granulated sugar if desired.

ELECTRIC MIXER METHOD:

Place all dry ingredients EXCEPT the SUGAR in mixer bowl. Using the paddle attachment mix on #2 to combine well.

Meantime:
Beat eggs and sugar together. Set aside. Mix 1/2 cup warm water, vegetable oil and lemon extract in small bowl; set aside.
Measure 1/4 CUP water in separate bowl; set aside.

Turn mixer on to #2. Slowly add the egg/sugar mixture, add the 1/2 cup water, oil and lemon extract. Beat until well combined several minutes. Add enough of the extra 1/4 cup water to make a smooth batter.

Cover mixing bowl and allow batter to rise about 2 hours. The batter will be ready when the batter is puffy and you see lots of air bubbles forming at the surface. Stir well before frying.

Follow instructions above for deep frying, etc.

The secret to a less oily malasada is to insure the oil temp has reached 375 F before cooking. Insert a candy thermometers into the pot while heating the oil. When it reaches 375 F and maintains that temp for a full minute start frying the malasadas, no more than 4 at a time.

Using a tablespoon to drop the malasadas into the fat creates a 2-1/2-3" malasada.

YIELD: About 30 malasada

Thanks to Judy Maybury, who sent me this recipe directly, I was able to
make these "fritters" Friday afternoon.

Say, I bet this recipe would be a great batter for fruit or corn
fritters.  Must give it a try sometime.

(1) Lightly buttered leftover biscuits, toasted under the broiler, are
delicious with honey or jam.

(2) Biscuits make the best kind of bread pudding (just ask anyone who
grew up in the South during the Depression). [Patricia Johansson <johansso@wfu.edu>]

---
I wouldn't throw away leftover biscuits either! I've always split them, buttered them and toasted them in a cast iron skillet (butter side down). The bottom gets golden brown and they get heated through and are delicious! I usually put a lid on for a few minutes when I'm in a hurry and they heat through faster.

  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1                     egg
  1                cup  Bob Red Mill's High Gluten flour ( 75-80%
                        protein)
     1/4           cup  oat flour
     3/4           cup  soy flour (full fat) - not lowfat
     1/4           cup  flax seed meal
     1/4           cup  wheat bran
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  Splenda
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  3          teaspoons  bread machine yeast
  1 1/8           cups  warm water

Add to bread machine salt, oil and egg. In a bowl mix together flours, bran, flax seed, baking powder and splenda. Add to machine. Sprinkle sugar and yeast on top. Add warm water. Set the machine on Dough cycle and let it do its stuff. After the kneading is done and the dough is rising - check it. If it has risen above the pan remove from pan onto lightly floured surface (use some gluten flour for this). Knead gently a few times and shape into a loaf shape. Spray a large loaf pan with Pam and place shaped dough in pan. Spray a piece of wax paper with Pam and lay over loaf pan and then cover with a light tea towel. Place in warm draft free place to rise for about 1 hour (bread should rise over the sides into a nice looking loaf). Bake at 365 F for 35 - 40 minutes (depending on your oven). This bread following these directions turned out wonderful for me and makes a traditional size of bread.

NOTES : This is the original recipe by Gaby. I made a couple of  modifications. I used soy powder instead of soy flour as I couldn't find it. I also didn't use Splenda. I used 1 1/2 tsp sugar. This bread came out wonderful. It is the first bread that I've ever made that rose so well.

I had this recipe that I've used quite often.  The only thing is that it
doesn't have that much of a taste.

Malasadas are one of the all time favorite snacks at local community functions and fund-raisers. A non-traditional way of preparing this is to  add nutmeg or cinnamon to the sugar mixture that is used to coat the
maladsadas.

Beat eggs.

Measure flour into mixing bowl and add salt. Make a well in the flour, pour yeast mixture, eggs and other ingredients. Beat in circular motion until the dough is soft. Cover, let raise until double. Turn dough over (or into another bowl) but do not punch down. Cover and let rise again until doubled in bulk.

Heat oil to 375 F and drop dough by teaspoons-full into oil and cook until brown. Be careful not to crowd the pot, as the oil temperature will drop and the malasadas will come out greasy. Remove from oil, drain, and shake in brown bag with sugar. Best when hot.

Note: If the malasadas are coming out with the center still doughy, turn the heat down on the oil which will allow them to cook longer.

  1               tbsp  salt

This dish arrived in Hawaii with the Portuguese settlers and has evolved over the years. A visit to the Fair isn't complete without enjoying hot malasadas. Makes a lot, depends on the size of dough you "pull".


1. Beat eggs and set aside.
2. Bring milk, shortening and sugar to boil, then cool to room temperature.
3. Dissolve yeast in potato water (left over from boiling the potatoes) and
make sure the water is not over 105 F.
4. Mix yeast mixture into milk mixture, add potatoes, soda, baking powder  and vanilla. Let rise until foamy (about 30 minutes)
5. Add eggs, salt and then add flour 1 cup at a time until all is mixed  into the liquid.
6. Put mixture into a bowl that has been lightly oiled, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until double, (about 1 hour).
7. Punch down, let rise again about 30 minutes.
8. Cut and form into balls about the size of golf balls.
9. Let rise until doubled.
10. Fry in deep fat at 360 F.
11. When cooked through, toss in bowl of granulated sugar.

Note: These snacks do not hold well but they taste great and have a hint of potato taste which is unique and gives it that "old fashion" taste.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               tsp.  dried ginger
                        -- or -- 1 Tb. fresh grated
                        ginger ,preferably
     1/2          tsp.  salt
  1               tsp.  baking soda
  2               cups  flour
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  maple syrup

I have accumulated quite a collection of gingerbread recipes, and this is one of my favorites. It's golden and delicious and the flavor of the ginger really comes through without molasses and a lot of other spices obscuring it.

I highly recommend using fresh grated ginger or the minced/crushed ginger you can get in a jar in the produce section, rather than dried. Needless to say, you want to use real maple syrup in this, too, rather than pancake/imitation syrup, but I'm sure that as a maple-lover you'd do that. :-)

Mix wet ingredients together in one bowl and dry ingredients in a larger  bowl.  Combine the two and stir only until mixed. Turn into a greased 9 X 9  inch pan and bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.

  1            package  yeast
  1                cup  quick cooking oats
  3               cups  bread flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  maple syrup

  1         Tablespoon  warm water

Mike was looking for recipes with Maple Syrup. My general advice is be creative-take one of those recipes with honey and substitute maple syrup. Or try using it as the sweetener in cinnamon rolls (cut back a bit on the water). (Just remember if you use a substantial amount of syrup to make a sweet bread, bake it at a lower temperature (like 350) so that it won't burn.) I like the taste also, and following is a recipe that I have enjoyed.

The ingredients are for a bread machine, but I have only made it manually. It tastes great!


Manual: Dissolve the yeast in the water. Let sit until foamy. Warm the syrup just a little bit--to 90 degrees or so. Mix together yeast and all other ingredients (hold back 1 cup of flour). Mix well, then knead in enough flour to make a nice, elastic dough. Rise til doubled, punch down, shape into a loaf, proof and bake.

Very nice flavor here-enjoy it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk -- scalded
     1/3           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
                        -- (or maple sugar)
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  4               tsp.  salt
  1               tsp.  cinnamon
     1/4          tsp.  nutmeg
  2               cups  rolled oats

You can substitute maple syrup for molasses or sugar or honey in any bread,  but here's one with a maple glaze, from Quebec.


In large mixing bowl, combine oats, maple syrup, brown sugar, corn oil, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Pour scalded milk over, stir, and let stand till lukewarm.

Meanwhile, dissolve 2 tsp. sugar in 1 cup warm water, sprinkle in 2 tbsp. active dry yeast, and proof 5-10 min., then add to lukewarm mixture in bowl.

Beat in 3 cups whole wheat flour, and stir in 3-4 cups all-purpose white flour till dough clears sides of bowl. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead 10 - 12 minutes, adding enough flour to keep from sticking.

At this point you can knead in 1 1/2 cups raisins OR you can add the raisins with the first of the whole wheat flour. (Kneading in is not my favourite way, so I usually add the fruit with the flour, or even earlier.)

Let rise in greased bowl, covered, till double, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down, divide in two, shape into loaves, and place in well-greased 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pans, or which ever size pans you use. Cover and let rise till double.

Bake at 375 F. 15 minutes, turn down to 350 F. approximately 40 minutes more. Turn out on wire racks, and while still hot, brush with following glaze: 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup maple syrup, 2 tbsp. butter - mix in saucepan, bring to boil stirring constantly, remove from heat and brush on bread. (You can also brush this glaze on lightly before baking, and after as well.)

  1 1/2    Tablespoons  Baking powder
     3/4      Teaspoon  Salt
     3/4           Cup  Cold unsalted butter

                        brushing
     1/3           Cup  Heavy cream

Roo says: I just took these out of the oven - at first nibble - it's pretty good!

Heat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 9-x-13-inch baking sheet. In a large bowl stir together the flour, pecans, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Set aside. In another bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and cream. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid mixture, combining with swift strokes until the dough clings together. Roll out about two inches thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut scones with a three-inch round biscuit cutter and place on baking sheet about two inches apart. Brush tops with additional maple syrup, and bake for fifteen to twenty minutes or until lightly browned. Transfer to a rack and cool.

  1              quart  buttermilk

     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup

  2           packages  dry yeast

  12              cups  unbleached white flour
                        -- (or 10 to 12 cups whole wheat flour)

Mike, you asked for a recipe calling for maple syrup.  This one is from  Bread Winners by Mel London (Rodale press, 1979).

(4 loaves)

Warm the liquid, butter, maple syrup, and salt in a large pot (five quarts or so) until the butter melts. If you are going to add raisins or currants, put them in right away -- they plump up nicely. Remove from stove and cool to lukewarm.

Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the liquid and let it get used to its new environment for a few minutes. Then, using a large wooden spoon, stir it in gently.

Beat eggs thoroughly in a separate bowl. Then add a cupful of flour to the liquid and yeast and stir it in before adding the eggs. Mix thoroughly.

Stir in the flour, a cup or two at a time, until the dough is thick and very sticky. When your arm won't stir it any longer, it's time to knead.

Flour your hands and turn the mixture out onto a floured surface. Keep working extra flour into the dough until you feel the firmness and the dough stops sticking to the board and to your hands. When the dough is smooth and firm and elastic (about 10 minutes later) and it springs back when you apply pressure, place it in a greased bowl, turn to coat top, cover and let it rise for about one hour.

Punch down, knead for one or two minutes, and shape into loaves. Place loaves in greased bread pans, cover again and let rise for about 45 minutes.

Bake in a preheated oven for approximately one hour. Bread should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Turn out onto racks and cool thoroughly before wrapping in foil or plastic.

I tried the Maple Whole Grain Bread that rls-1850@juno.com submitted on Mon, 5 Mar 2001, and it was wonderful! Following are the changes I made to the ingredients for 4 loaves: 2 T canola oil instead of 1/2 cup butter, a bit of extra maple syrup (to finish off the bottle), 2 T sea salt instead of 2 tsp, used 1/2 white whole wheat and 1/2 bread flour, and threw in a few handfuls of rolled oats (another item that needed finishing off). This bread was so moist and tasted just heavenly.

Preheat oven to 500F. In a large warm bowl, put one-half cup of hot water, one quarter ounce dry active yeast and one teaspoon of sugar. After this is dissolved, stir in three-quarters of a cup of warm water. Next, add 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour, one cup at a time. Then add salt. When the mix becomes thick enough, use your hands to continue mixing.

Remove the dough from the bowl, and continue to kneed on a floured surface until the dough is smooth. (You may add small amounts of flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands) Put the dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Then, set it in a warm place to rise for an hour.

Spray two large cooking sheets with cooking spray and spread one-half of the dough on each cookie sheet in the shape of a large narrow oval. (The dough should be about one-third of an inch thick.) Dip your hands in cold water, spread your fingers, and drag them through the dough making deep grooves. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top. Put the bread in the oven for about 10 minutes or until it is a medium golden brown. ENJOY!!!

  2           packages  active dry yeast -- (1/4 ounce each)
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        -- (110F to 115F)

     1/2           cup  honey
  2                     eggs

  1         tablespoon  salt

Recently I saw a copy of a magazine "Country Extra" in which I found the subject recipe. I tried it and found it to be a very good bread. It rises well has a good crumb and, I think, an excellent flavor. Some of you readers may find it interesting.

I use a Kitchenaid beginning with the paddle and switching to the Pam sprayed hook and knead for 15 minutes. Some where I have read that 1/3 teaspoon of yeast per cup of flour is sufficient thus, I do not use the full amount in the recipe. I find I must add a bit more flour. As a result, I finish with just under 4 pounds of dough. The dough ferments in a bowl until doubled. This I divide, shape and place in 4 X 8-inch loaf pans, cover and set aside to proof. Some days 1 1/2 to 2 hours are required to rise about 1-inch above the sides of the pans.

The result is 3 baked loaves of just over 1 pound each.

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside. In another bowl, stir boiling water and shortening until shortening is melted. Add honey; cool to 110 - 115 F.

Add eggs, oats, salt and shortening mixture to yeast mixture. Add 3 cups flour; stir until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.

Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape each portion into a loaf. Place in two greased 9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pans. Prick tops with a fork. Brush with butter. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Bake at 350 F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.

YIELD: 2 loaves.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  active dry yeast -- (.25 ounce)
  1           teaspoon  white sugar
  2               cups  water
  4               cups  rye flour
  1                cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1         tablespoon  salt
  8               cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  caraway seed

1. The night before making the bread, in a medium sized mixing bowl,  dissolve one packet of yeast and the sugar in 2 cups of water. Let stand  until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the rye flour until the mixture is  smooth. Cover and let stand overnight.
2. The next day, dissolve the remaining package of yeast in the buttermilk.  Add the rye flour mixture,  the baking soda, the salt, 4 cups of the bread  flour and stir to combine. Add the remaining 4 cups of bread flour, 1/2 cup  at a time, stirring well after each addition (you may not need to add all  of the flour). When the dough has become a smooth and coherent mass, turn  it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple,  about 8 minutes. Sprinkle the caraway seeds on the dough and knead them in  until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
3. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to  coat with the oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for  about 1 hour or until the volume has doubled.
4. Preheat oven to 350F (175C).
5. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into three  pieces. Form each piece into a loaf and place in 3 lightly greased 9x5 inch  bread pans. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour.
6. Bake at 350F (175C) for about 35 minutes or until the bottom of the  loaves sound hollow when tapped.

NOTES : The recipe below is one of my very favorites but I find that the finished product is a little tougher than it should be. I'm hoping you can give me some guidance into where I can make adjustments to achieve a more tender crust; is it the flour? is it the length of the knead? I'd appreciate your thoughts.

I always make this dough in my bread machine, then shape it into rolls.

                        FILLING
     3/4           cup  Baker's Cinnamon Filling
                        -- (pg 12 - or make your own)

  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        -- or 2 tablespoons water
  1                cup  glazing sugar or confectioners' sugar




BUNS: Mix and knead together all of the dough ingredients -- by hand, mixer or bread machine -- to form a soft, smooth dough. Place it in a greased bowl, cover, and allow it to rise in a warm place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours; it should almost double in size.

FILLING: Mix the Baker's Cinnamon Filling with the water. Set it aside.

ASSEMBLY: Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface and roll it into a rectangle measuring about 8 x 24 inches. Spread a thin layer of cinnamon filling over the dough, leaving about 1 inch uncovered on the short side nearest you. Sprinkle with the additional chips, etc. of your choice. Starting with the short edge covered with filling, roll the dough into a log. Use a serrated knife to gently "saw" the log into six equal pieces. Place each bun into a lightly greased cup of a cinnamon bun pan, or onto a baking sheet (leaving about 2 inches between them), pressing down slightly. Cover the buns, and let them rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1-1/4 hours, until they're quite puffy. (I used parchment paper an placed it on a half-sheet pan

BAKING: Bake the buns in a preheated 350 F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven and let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn them out of the pan and allow them to cool to just slightly warm before frosting.

ICING: Mix the heavy cream and confectioners' sugar or glazing sugar to make a creamy glaze; use water for a thinner glaze. Drizzle the icing over the buns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  lukewarm water
  2           packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  molasses
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Postum
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  raisins
  2               cups  rye flour
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour
  2               cups  whole wheat flour -- as needed, up to 3
                        oil for the bowl and the dough
                        cornmeal for the baking sheet

Preparation time: 4 to 5 hours, most of which is rising time. Yield: 16 rolls.

Don't be startled by the presence of chocolate chips in this recipe. They serve to darken, moisten, and slightly sweeten the rolls but their presence will be extremely subtle.

If you don't have Postum, you can use instant coffee. You can even use strong black coffee, and just slightly adjust the amount of flour to accommodate the change. Remember that, apart from sensitivity to heat, dough is quite flexible.

Also, don't be discouraged by what seems like a major preparation time commitment. During most of those 4 to 5 hours the dough is rising, and you are free to do other things. There is only a modest amount of actual labor required. The result is really worthwhile, and the rolls keep for up to two weeks if kept in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator. They are delicious sliced and toasted.

NOTE: The rolls can be assembled up to three days in advance of baking. Store them in an airtight plastic bag in the refrigerator.

1. Melt the chocolate chips and butter together over very low heat, then remove from heat and cool to room temperature.

2. Place wrist-temperature water in a large bowl. Sprinkle in the yeast and let it stand 5 minutes. It will be foamy.

3. Stir in molasses with a wooden spoon. Add Postum, salt, and raisins.

4. Making sure it is no warmer than room temperature, drizzle in the chocolate mixture, mixing constantly

5. Add rye flour and 1 cup each of the white and whole wheat. Stir as vigorously as possible with a wooden spoon.

6. Gradually knead in all the white flour plus enough additional whole wheat flour to make a smooth, nonsticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead about 10 minutes. The dough will be dense. Let it rest while you clean the mixing bowl.

7. Lightly oil the bowl and the top surface of the dough. Put the dough in the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let rise in a warm place for at least 3 hours. It will rise by about half of its original volume.

8. Punch down the dough and knead it on a floured surface another 5 minutes or so. Cut the dough in half, then cut each half into 8 equal parts. Knead each little piece for a minute or two, and form into a ball (it should be the approximate size of a slightly overweight golf ball).

9. Dust a baking sheet (or two, depending on the size) with cornmeal, and arrange the balls of dough at least 3 inches apart. Let the dough rise again for 45 minutes to 1 hour. (You may also let it rise in the refrigerator. Wrap the baking sheet loosely but airtight in a plastic bag and refrigerate. The rolls can remain stored this way up to three days before baking. They can go into a preheated oven directly from the refrigerator.

10. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the rolls sound hollow when thumped. Remove from the sheet and cool at least 10 minutes before serving.

NOTES : On Christmas morning I decided to make the following rolls for dinner. What a mistake! They look like something we would like - dark and heavy. I started them in plenty of time. The dough was the heaviest that I have every worked with. I added only 1 cup of white and one cup of wheat flour before I realized that there was too much flour already. I added a tad more water. They barely raised. I did bake them eventually.

The rolls were good, but looked and tasted too heavy. I think that there is a problem with the liquid/flour proportions in the recipe. What do you think? I'd like to try them again. There are many bread recipes in this book that I would like to try, but I need to have a sense that they are real, useable recipes.

Oh, about the Postum. I used dry coffee granules. Does the author mean Postum that is made or dry postum?

                  Ratio Of Instant Yeast To Active Yeast

I've gone over to instant yeast almost exclusively. The ratio I use is: for every 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast, use 1/3 teaspoon instant yeast. If the bread you're making rises a little faster than usual, cut back a bit more on the yeast. The change in the yeast will affect the fermentation and proofing times (longer or shorter) but most likely will not affect the finished product - at least that's been my experience.

Perfect Bread
How To Conquer Bread Baking
by Betsy Oppenneer

This is a video tape that is wonderful!! I used to make bread by hand when my daughters were young. But I sure wish I had this tape then to not only learn how to make it correctly by hand but to learn some of Betsy's secrets. This is a very good tape for beginning bakers but bakers who have been baking by hand can pick up some tips/tricks also. I know that I will watch this tape more times so that I can learn even more. Jeff watched it also and wanted to try making some by hand. When our house remodel is completed (June or if we get our kitchen back before then) he is going to give it a try. I asked my daughter, Susan, to review the tape also .... she has never made a hand made loaf till now. She made the white bread recipe below and it turned out very, very well!! She learned a lot from the tape and chose to attempt this method.

Betsy's Favorite White Bread

2 1/2 cups warm water
2 (1/4 ounce) or 2 scant tablespoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons oil
7 cups unbleached flour, approximately

Directions are in the video.

Here is another review by another friend of mine, Leigh, who has been making bread for many years also. Here is her review of this tape...

>Okay, so I watched the first video on making bread. I've been making bread >off and on for close to thirty years now, and figured I would be fast >forwarding through much of it. Imagine my surprise when I actually learned >several new things! The whole family ended up watching it with me. I >thought it covered all the basics well, and included some techniques with >which I was not familiar. I would definitely recommend it for any beginner, >and for some of us who are just starting to make bread well. >

Perfect Bread
Fun With Creative Shapes
by Betsy Oppenneer

and this is just as good as her video of How To Conquer Bread Baking. I was very impressed at how clearly she explains how to easily shape doughs. I have always been very intimidated making braids and this explains it so clearly that I don't know why I haven't tried it before. She covers many varieties of rolls ... her cloverleaf roll method is very interesting ... she also includes ropes, breadsticks, wreathes and braids. There are 30 varieties of the above shapes and even the explaination on how to glaze sweet bread. Another thing that really impressed me was the ease of locating a certain shape that you want to learn about ... go to the time listed on the back of the video and then just fast forward to that time on the vcr. This is a treasure of a video.

Here is another review from Leigh:

>My only complaint is that there were
>so many ideas that I will NEVER remember them all. I did have some bread >dough running while watching the video, and ended up doing her eight braid >bread; beautiful. She also had some useful tips on how to form the ropes >and letting them relax a few seconds to get them to cooperate. I will watch >it again as soon as I have the chance.

>Leigh

I think this is a very well thought out and put together video. There are so many varieties of shapes that it would take you almost a month to make them all. I was again impressed with Betsy's ease of communication via this tape and how easy she makes the shapes. I especially like the timing on the back of both tapes so I can go to a particular time and get exactly what I want to learn.

I definitely recommend this tape and also her other one. You can go to Betsy's website www.breadworksinc.com to purchase both of her video's and book. I definitely recommend all of these!!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                 c.  white flour
  1 1/2             c.  whole wheat or barley flour
  3               tsp.  baking powder
  1               tsp.  baking soda
  2                 c.  buttermilk

  2              tsps.  salt
     1/2            c.  shortening

My mom got this from her Aunt Mae, who did come from Finland. I have been very interested in baking the breads of my grandmother's homeland and my mom gave me a cookbook by Beatrice A. Ojakangas called The Finnish Cookbook, by Crown Publishers, Inc., New York.

Mae said,"mine came the size of a 12in. round. I greased the pan."

Sift dry ingredients together into bowl, cut in shortening until mixture has a coarse crumb feeling. Add buttermilk and stir together until dough clings together. Knead on lightly floured board for a couple of minutes, roll into a round loaf to fit ungreased cookie sheet. Prick top all over with fork, bake in preheated oven 350F for 25 min or until golden.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           Cup  Very Warm Water
     1/2      Teaspoon  Sugar
  2           Packages  Active Dry Yeast
  2               Cups  Rye Flour
  2          Teaspoons  Salt
     1/2           Cup  Mashed Potatoes
     1/2           Cup  Water
  1                Cup  All-Purpose Flour -- (To 1 1/2 Cups)

1. In a glass measuring cup, stir together the warm water and sugar. Stir in the yeast and let it proof.

2. In a large bowl, combine the rye flour and salt. Stir in the yeast mixture, potatoes, and 1/2 cup water. Stir in 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour to make a dough that is firm enough to handle.

3. Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead in the remaining all-purpose flour.

4. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk.

5. Punch dough down and form into a loaf. Place in a greased 8 1/2 x 3 5/8 x 2 5/8 inch loaf pan. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk.

6. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake for 1 hour or until loaf is lightly browned on top and bottom and sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on wire rack.

Variation: Add 1 tablespoon caraway seeds to the dough when you stir in the liquids.

Makes: 1 loaf; serves 12 to 16.

Notes: This makes a small, dense, chewy loaf of bread. You can make it with all rye flour and no all-purpose, but try to get "white" rye or light rye flour rather than whole grain rye flour; because the bread becomes extremely sour when made exclusively with whole grain rye.

Notes: If you don't have fresh rosemary, dried will do -- use 1 tablespoon crumbled.

     1/2           cup  very warm water
                        (105 - 115 Degrees F.)
     1/4           Cup  Cornmeal
     1/2      Teaspoon  Sugar
  2           Packages  Active Dry Yeast

1. In a large bowl, stir together the warm water and the cornmeal.

2. In a glass measuring cup, stir together the remaining 1/2 cup warm water and the sugar. Stir in the yeast and let it proof. Stir the proofed yeast, the potatoes, molasses, and oil into the cornmeal mixture.

3. Stir 1 1/4 cups of the all-purpose flour, the rye flour, and salt into the yeast-cornmeal mixture. Stir in 3/4 cup more all-purpose flour to make a dough that is firm enough to handle.

4. Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a dough that is manageable and no longer sticky.

5. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Set in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down and let rise again.

6. Punch dough down and form into a loaf. Place in two greased 8 1/2 x 3 5/8 x 2 5/8 inch loaf pans. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk.

7. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Bake for 40 minutes or until loaf is lightly browned on top and bottom and sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on wire rack.

Variation: Use 1 cup more rye flour and 1 cup less all-purpose flour. Add 1 tablespoon caraway seeds when you add the rye flour.

Makes: 2 loaves; serves: 24

Notes: Pumpernickel is supposed to be a dense, heavy, ryelike bread. In that sense this version is a failure because it's actually light and moist. If you want a more traditional pumpernickel, follow the variation. You can use instant mashed potatoes if you don't want to start from scratch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  boiling water
     1/3           cup  seven-grain cereal
  2        tablespoons  salad oil
  2        tablespoons  honey
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (105F-115F)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                     egg
  2               cups  whole wheat flour -- up to 2 1/2 cups

Seven-grain cereals are available in health and natural foods stores, and although different brands may have different proportions, all work equally well in this recipe. The usual combination consists of some blending of wheat, oats, triticale, millet, soybeans, buckwheat and yellow corn.

MAKES 1 LOAF

In large mixing bowl, mix the boiling water and cereal; let stand until cooled. Add the oil, honey, and salt to cereal. In small bowl or cup, mix the warm water into the yeast. Let stand 5 minutes or until yeast is foamy. When cereal mixture has cooled to 105F-115F., add yeast and egg. Stir in enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough; let stand 15 minutes. Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Wash bowl, lightly grease it, add dough to bowl, turn over to grease top, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 to 2 hours.

Punch dough down and shape into an oblong loaf. Lightly grease an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Place dough into pan. Let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until loaf is browned and sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan and cool on rack.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     shredded wheat biscuits
  2               tbsp  butter
     1/2           tsp  salt
     1/3           cup  honey or maple syrup
  1                pkg  yeast -- proofed in
     1/4           cup  water
  5 1/2           cups  flour -- (5 1/2 to 6)

We are Vermont maple syrup producers.

In any recipe calling for honey I have always subsituted an equal amount of maple syrup. When used as a subsitute for sugar in cooking, use 3/4 cup maple syrup to replace 1 cup sugar. For baking, use 3/4 cup maple syrup for each cup of sugar, but reduce the liquid specified in the recipe by about 3 tablespoons for every cup of syrup subsituted.


Cover all ingredients except last two with 2 cups boiling water.  Let cool. Add the proofed yeast.  Work in flour.  Knead, let rise until doubled, punch down and form.

Makes 2 loaves
Bake 400 F oven, 30 minutes

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        -- (105 to 115 F)
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  butter -- melted and divided
  1 1/2           cups  firmly packed brown sugar -- divided
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely chopped pecans
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon

Combine 1 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan; heat until the butter melts, stirring occasionally. Cool to 105 to 115 F.

Combine yeast, warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar in a 1 cup liquid measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes. Combine butter mixture and the yeast mixture. Add egg; stir well.

Combine yeast mixture, 2 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Add remaining 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring vigorously until dough is no longer sticky and pulls away from sides of the bowl. Brush or lightly dub dough with some of the melted butter. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm (85 F) place, free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Combine 1/2 cup melted butter, 1 cup brown sugar, corn syrup and pecans; sprinkle mixture evenly in the bottom of a well greased 13 X 9 X 2-inch pan. Set pan aside. Combine remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.

Punch dough down; turn out onto a well floured surface. Roll dough into an 18 X 15-inch rectangle. Brush dough generously with some of the remaining melted butter; sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough jellyroll fashion, starting at the long side. Cut roll into 12 slices, 1 1/2 inches thick. Place slices, cut sides down, in the prepared pan. Brush slices with remaining melted butter. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 1 hour or until tops of rolls rise just above top of the pan.

Preheat the oven to 350 F and put the oven rack in the center of oven. Bake rolls, uncovered, for 18 to 22 minutes or until golden. Cool in pan on a wire rack 8 minutes. Invert pan onto wax paper; let rolls stand, covered with the pan for minute. Remove pan, scraping any remaining pecan mixture from the pan onto the rolls. Serve warm, Yield: 1 dozen.

Note:

I do not do it this way!! I prefer to put all but a little of the flour in the mixer bowl and then add about 1/3 of the liquid at a time while mixing with the dough hook at low speed until all liquid, and remaining flour if necessary is added then increase speed to medium. Continue until the dough looks right!

                        Dough:
  1                cup  water
  1              Tbsp.  butter
  1              Tbsp.  sugar

  3               cups  flour
  2 1/2           tsp.  Yeast

I tried this recipe and I really liked it. Strange how its mostly the ingredients you use in making a loaf of bread. But it really tastes different.. Like a pretzel!! Next time you have company I strongly suggest you try this, makes great nibbleizers.


Put on dough program of bread machine or knead by hand and let rise till double. Roll out into 10"x16" rectangle. Cut into 12 strips, 16" long, shape into pretzel shapes, ( I just cut into mini bread sticks, much easier) place on 2 greased cookie sheets and let rise in warm place 15-20 minutes.

In a pot bring 6 cups water and 1/4 cup baking soda to a boil. Boil pretzels, 5 seconds on each side. Put back on cookie sheets.

Brush with a mixture of 1 egg white mixed with 1 Tbsp. water. Sprinkle with coarse salt ( Pretzel salt from King Arthur is great). You need the coarse salt. It gives it a zing.


Bake at 400 degrees for 9 minutes. Remove immediately to wire rack. Best eaten when warm.

I read the request for the sourdough challah recipe with ambivalence since it seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. In America, challah is a somewhat sweet as well as rich bread used to celebrate the sabbath. It is traditional to make it even sweeter at times such as Jewish New Years with the addition of more sugar and/or raisins. Well, in life we must take the bitter(sour) with the sweet ;-) so here is the recipe based on Ed Wood's "World Sourdoughs from Antiquity". Enjoy!


STARTER
2 cups bread flour
1-1/2 cups warm water
bread flour for additional feedings

Combine flour and water in a 2-quart plastic, glass or stainless steel bowl. Stir the mixture with sufficient vigor to beat in additional air. Place the bowl in a
protected spot outdoors. If insects or other critters are a potential problem, cover the bowl with cheesecloth. Stir the mixture vigorously at least twice every 24 hours. In 2 or 3 days, bubbles should appear on the surface as the first indication that you have been successful. Feed the culture another cup of flour and sufficient warm water to maintain consistency, about 3/4 of a cup. You may need to repeat this additional feeding at 12-hour intervals for several days.When you capture a yeast that is active enough to be useful, it will form a layer of foam 1 to 2 inches deep. Culture is ready to use in the following first proof.

FIRST PROOF
2 cups active culture
3 cups flour
2 cups warm water

In a 4-quart mixing bowl, combine the culture, flour and warm water. Mixture need not be lump-free. Let rise for about 12 hours. Measure out the 4 cups of culture called for in the challah recipe. Place the remaining culture in an airtight container and refrigerate to reserve for another sourdough bread recipe. For the second proof and baking, follow the directions given in the challah recipe.

SOURDOUGH CHALLAH
Makes 1 very large loaf

Dough:
4 cups culture from the first proof
3 Tbs. butter
1 cup milk
2 tsp. salt
3 Tbs. sugar
2 eggs beaten
6 cups white bread flour
additional bread flour, if needed
---
Glaze:
1 egg, beaten
1 Tbs. sesame seeds

Place the culture into a large mixing bowl. melt the butter over moderate heat, add the milk to the butter and warm to 75 to 85 degrees. Add the salt, sugar and eggs, and stir until dissolved. Add this mixture to the culture and mix well. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring until it is too stiff to mix by hand. Turn onto a floured board and knead in remaining flour until dough is satin Add more flour to obtain the desired texture if necessary. Divide the dough into 4 equal balls. Roll each ball into a rope about 18 to 20 inches long and 1 inch in diameter. Pinch the four ropes together at one end and braid by bringing the rope on the right over the one next to it, under the third one and over the last one. Repeat, always starting with the rope on the right until the braid is complete. Pinch the ends together. Place on a baking sheet and proof, covered at 85 degrees for 1 to 2 hours, or until about double in size.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush the loaf with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 35 minutes. The challah is done when it turns a toasty
brown. Remove from baking sheet and cool on a wire rack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        THE SPONGE
  1                cup  KA Unbleached A-P Flour
  1                cup  KA 100 percent White Whole Wheat Flour
  2               Tbsp  sugar
  2               cups  buttermilk -- slightly warmed
                        -- (this is where a microwave can help)
  1                cup  sourdough starter
                        ---
                        THE BATTER
                        All of the sponge -- (above)
  2                     eggs [separated]
     1/4           cup  [Canola] vegetable oil
                        -- (or melted butter)
     1/2           tsp  salt -- (to taste) (1/2 to
                        -- 1)
  1                tsp  baking soda
                        [2 tsp baking powder] optional

Making the Sponge: This first step is best done the night before you want to
serve the waffles. First, remove your starter from the refrigerator, stir it
together with a spoon or whisk and pour out a cup. In a large mixing bowl,
combine the flours and sugar. Pour in the [warmed] buttermilk and the
sourdough starter. Stir this mixture until just combined. Cover loosely and
let this sit on your counter until the next morning.

Feeding the Starter: Add to the remaining starter a cup of water and a cup
of flour. Stir, cover loosely and let it sit out on your counter until the
next morning to let it work and grow. Then refrigerate it until you want to
use it again.

Creating the Batter: Next morning, complete the batter while you preheat
your waffle iron. In a small mixing bowl, beat together the egg [yokes], oil
or butter, salt and baking soda. [In a separate bowl beat the egg whites
until almost stiff.] Let the children (of any age) blend [the egg yoke
mixture and then the beaten egg whites] into the sponge you made the night
before. (Watch what happens; it's neat.) Grease your iron (a pastry brush
makes this easy) and pour on to 1/2 cup of batter. Close the iron. A waffle
usually cooks in 2 to 4 minutes. If you try to raise the lid and it's
reluctant to come, the waffle is probably not done. Waffles are best eaten
right from the iron if you like them crisp, traditionally with butter and
maple syrup.

YIELD: 8 Waffles. Note: For a crowd, you can double this recipe.

JONI'S NOTES
Results: Excellent; the new standard.

Method: Follow recipe exactly except: beat egg yolks separately and add to
oil, soda and salt. Beat egg whites until almost stiff. Mix egg yolk mixture
into batter then fold beaten egg whites into all.

Comments: Easy recipe. Like idea of preparing most of the recipe the night
before.

NOTES : Our weekend favorite is sourdough waffles. These beat baking powder waffles by a mile; if we can't make these, we don't eat waffles. When you have a starter to take care of, and you don't have time to make bread, waffles are the answer. You can make these a weekly ritual with very little effort, thus feeding the masses (and the sourdough starter at the same time). This also makes great pancake batter. Here's what we do:

Hope you guys enjoy this as much as our family does.

  2                 c.  spelt flour berries ground fine

  1               tsp.  salt

When I prepare dough using the proportions below, it tastes wonderful and the dough expands--but it expands sideways. I get perfect texture but instead of hemispheres I get broad loaves only 1-1/2 high. The dough cannot support its own weight. If I add more flour to make the dough less dense, then the dough is insufficiently elastic to expand, so that it bakes into bread that is excessively dense. I could throw in more yeast and/or sugar to try go make more bubbles but making inelastic dough expand would require not greater quantities of CO2 but higher pressures.

     1/8           cup  heavy cream
     1/8           cup  water -- (1/8 to 1/4)
  2                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  butter in pieces
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2            tsp  yeast -- (1 1/2 to 2)
                        ---
                        FILLING
     2/3           cup  brown sugar
  1 1/4           tsp.  cinnamon
     1/3           cup  very soft butter
                        ---
                        SYRUP
  3               tbsp  butter
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2               tbsp  water
  30                    pecan halves -- (optional)

8" square or round pan

Dough: Put dough ingredients in bread pan in order suggested by your bread machine instructions. Set for white or sweet bread, dough stage. Press Start. Remove dough and punch down.

Filling: Mix brown sugar, cinnamon & butter. Microwave for 6 to 10 seconds to spread easier.

For the smaller recipe, roll dough into a rectangle 7 to 8 inches wide and about 16 inches long. For the larger recipe, cut down in half and roll into two rectangles, each 7 to 8 inches wide and 11 to 12 inches long. Spread filling to edges and roll into long cylinder. Cut into 1 - 2 inch slices.

The rolls can be baked together in baking pans or separately in muffin pans. The muffin-pan rolls are neater and crusty on the outside. If you cook them in baking pans, they will be softer. An 8-inch square baking pan is the perfect size for nine rolls, a 9 x 13 inch pan should hold 15 rolls.

Syrup: Make the syrup by combining butter, brown sugar, and water in a small pan. Heat until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Stir well, then pour syrup into the bottoms of the baking pan or muffin-pan cups. Place two pecan halves in the bottom of each muffin cup, or on the top of each roll if you are using a baking pan. Place rolls in muffin cups, or turn them upside down (so pecans are on the bottom) in a baking pan. Cover rolls loosely, set them in a warm place, and let them rise until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Bake rolls in a preheated 350 F oven until they are nicely browned, 17 to 22 minutes in a muffin pan, 20 to 25 minutes in a baking pan, The rolls must be removed from the pan immediately, or the sugar syrup will harden. Keeping in mind that excess sugar syrup will run off, invert the pan or muffin pan over a large plate or baking sheet. Let them cool slightly, or the hot sugar will burn your mouth.

NOTES : I combined three recipes to create these sticky buns which I made for our office on the day of the Tall Ships Parade of Sail last summer in Halifax. The dough is from the Sally Lunn bread in Bread Machine Magic by Rehberg and Conway, the Filling is from the Cinnabon Recipe and the Syrup is from

Let me first say how much I have enjoyed and learned in the past year that I have been lurking on the sidelines from you great bakers from all over the world. I have refrained from giving you all my two cents on many occasions but this time I cannot resist from giving you my time-saving and clean-up saving methods developed from years of experience. I am responding to Alexandra Mahoney's call for help regarding kneading with wet doughs. After making bread for decades, I am a big fan of the wet doughs and have Dan Leader's Bread Alone" and Suzanne Dunaway's "No Need to Knead" books to thank for it. I make a big focaccia that looks professional and rivals what is sold in the bakery cafe at the CIA (for those of you not in the know, it is the Culinary Institute of America - our country's best culinary school) in Hyde Park, NY. (Wow, I am tooting my own horn!) And I must share my simple method with you.

I first taught myself how to make bread in the 70's from reading cook books - the usual white dough stuff. Have continued all these years, including over ten years using my DAK bread machine, one of the first to hit this country in the late 80's from Japan. Made literally hundreds of loaves of French-Italian type breads using the manual cycle and a cheap $4 Ecko (sp?) non-stick double bread pan (that finally gave out and started sticking after years of use). Now I am back to hand mixing and my method is as follows:

I mix up a sourdough starter (out of Bread Alone) with yeast and water, add some salt and a couple of cups of flour in one of those large (not the biggest) cheap stainless steel bowls that are everywhere (it is light and spins around easily on the counter, key components of my method), mixing with a wooden spoon. Then when the going gets a little heavy, I switch from spoon to one of those plastic kidney-shaped scrapers (think I got it in Lechters (sp?) for $1 with a hole in it. Then gradually add the rest of the flour, scraping the outside of the dough against the side of the bowl with the curved scraper, spinning the bowl as necessary with my left hand, to keep the sides of the bowl clean and the dough worked; scrape, spin and flop the dough on top of itself. Remember this is a wet dough and I add only enough flour to give it some stability. When I am finished and the dough is very wet (my hands are clean, clean, maybe a little dough on my right thumb (this recipe is NOT for someone who loves getting into the dough) ) I pour perhaps a tablespoon of oil on top, then scrape and spin again to get the oil around the dough, messily flip it over with the scraper, put a lid or saran on the ss bowl, put in the refrig. Leave in for a day or two; then with the handy scraper, tilt bowl and scrape out the dough (it is wet and spongy) onto parchment.

The whole put-together dough and mixing method takes about 15 minutes, very streamlined; no counter clean-up and no messy hands and the focaccia comes out beautifully! I created this bowl method out of necessity; I have a tile-topped counter (not good for anything except looking at - never again), definitely not for any kind of dough preparation. All I end up cleaning is the bowl! One can use this method with any type of dough, requiring a little kneading. When I do a regular dough, I use the scraper as long as possible, then switch using my right hand to knead, and spin the bowl with the left. And the bowl is very easy to clean because it is continually scraped!

One more note: on a period show lately dating from the 1800's, I saw a "downstairs" cook kneading dough in a wooden shallow large box, similar to what we would know as a tray. Isn't that cleaver, if one is tight with space and has a tile-topped counter!?

I wanted to address the difficulty in general of kneading wet, "artisan" doughs such as Maggie Glezer's recipes. Many bread baking gurus suggest that these doughs be made in a mixer because of the difficulty of working with such sticky doughs. I sometimes just like to do it by hand anyway. I have made the ciabatta and baguettes from Maggie's book (they are super!) by hand using the following method. I mix and knead the dough right in my large mixing bowl. I keep one hand "clean" and use it to turn the bowl. I use my "wet" hand along with a plastic, flexible bench knife/pot scraper to turn and fold the gloppy mess. Eventually, there is definitely a difference in the look and consistency of the dough that signals its development. It will not look like a less wet dough (smooth and with a definite form), but nonetheless it will bake up fine. You can't avoid at least one sticky hand and you won't be able to work with a real rhythm, but that is the nature of the beast. The bowl gives you some control so that the dough doesn't spread all over. To get rid of that sticky hand, try a baker's trick: rub some extra flour between both hands over a sink. The gooey stuff will absorb the flour and rub off your hands in a jiff. Please try this, before investing in more products.

  1                cup  warm water -- 110 degrees
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  shortening or oil
     1/4           cup  uncooked quick rolled oats

     1/4           cup  dark rye flour
     1/4           cup  cooked wild rice -- very well drained
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
                        Glaze and topping:
                        egg beaten with water
                        toasted salted sunflower seeds

FROM: "Need to feed a crowd?  Try these recipes," by Beatrice
Ojakangas.  The author provided this adaptation to her 16 loaf recipe.

The single loaf recipe can be mixed in the food processor or in the bread
machine using the dough cycle (but bake it in the oven).  This bread makes
a wonderful sandwich, open-faced or otherwise.  My favorite way is to
spread a slice thickly with hummus and top it with tomato.

Cook raw wild rice according to package directions until very tender;  be
sure to cool thoroughly before adding to the bread.

Combine warm water, honey and yeast in large mixer bowl.  Let stand 5
minutes until yeast bubbles.  Add the salt, shortening, rolled oats, wheat
flour, rye flour and wild rice;  mix at low speed until smooth.

Slowly add the bread flour;  turn mixer on low to medium speed for about 10
minutes or until the dough is well mixed, pulls away from the sides of the
bowl and has a slightly tacky feel.  Cover and let rise until doubled
(about 1 hour).

Shape into an oblong or round loaf.  Place on lightly greased pan.  Cover,
and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.  Brush loaf with the
egg-water mixture and sprinkle with the sunflower seeds.  Slash loaf with a
sharp blade in two or three places.

Bake in a 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes.  Cool on a rack, and slice
for serving.  Makes 10 generous slices per loaf.

* (available from King Arthur Flours anything else you think might be good

In a large bowl, combine the water, starter, and 3 cups of the flour, mixing till smooth. Stir in the salt, sugar, yeast granular lecithin (if using) and gluten, then an additional 2 cups of flour. Stir till the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding only enough additional flour as necessary; a slack (sticky) dough makes a light loaf.

Knead the dough for 5 minutes, by hand on a lightly greased work surface or in an electric mixer. Let it rest for several minutes, then knead for an additional 5 minutes. Turn the dough into an oiled bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into six pieces (for thin baguettes) or three pieces (for thicker Italian loaves). Shape each piece into an 18-inch long loaf, and place the loaves, at least 4 inches apart, on greased parchment-lined baking sheets, or in lightly greased baguette pans. Cover the loaves with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let them rise for 1 hour, or until they're nice and puffy.

Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Gently brush the loaves with the egg yolk glaze, and sprinkle them generously with Italian seasoning and sesame seeds, or Parmesan cheese, garlic slices, or anything else you think would turn a baguette into an Ultimate Baguette. Spray the loaves with olive oil spray, and bake them for about 20 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown. Remove the loaves from the oven, and turn your oven to "broil." Return the loaves to the top rack of the oven and CAREFULLY broil them till they're a deep golden brown. Remove the loaves from the oven, and cool them on a wire rack.

NOTES : This is a great recipe but be warned: It's extremely slack. I almost had to pour it into the baguette pans. Since I use non-stick perforated pans I lined the pans with parchment paper to keep dough from seeping. At 450 degrees the baguettes bake quickly so check at 18 minutes for doneness.

Months of kitchen tests revealed almost no difference in baking results when using different types and brands of yeast. It's how you use them that matters.

Like many things that inspire awe through their magical properties, yeast inspires angst as well. Baking books old and new abound with yeasted recipes, and yet the single-celled spore that enlivens our breads still breeds confusion.
Some recipes, for example, say that fresh yeast is essential to the success of a sweet roll or that a dough cannot rise unless it is in a warm place. Some recipes call for two packets of yeast, others a fraction of a teaspoon. One hears that a special yeast is necessary for bread machines and that quick-rise yeast puts bread on the table fast. Which yeasts need to be proofed (activated by dissolving in liquid before use)?Refrigerated? If a dough rises sluggishly, is the yeast simply old? What has happened when dough rises like a hot air balloon but bakes up like a sneaker? Yet another question worth asking is how to keep track of the commercial yeasts multiplying on grocery shelves in colorful profusion. Is one really any different from the other? But the first thing we wanted to know was this: Does the type of yeast-fresh, active dry, or instant-matter? Armed with a stack of recipes and enough yeast to raise the dead, we went into the test kitchen to find out.

The Nature of Yeast
First, let's get a few basics in line. Yeast is a living organism. Its function in a bread dough is to consume sugars and starches in the flour and convert them into carbon dioxide and alcohol, which give bread its lift and flavor. This process is known as fermentation. Flavor compounds and alcohol-byproducts of
fermentation-give a yeasted bread its characteristically irresistible aroma and flavor.
Yeast has changed over the centuries. Until the 1700s, bread was produced from bitter beer or brewer's yeast (called barm, referring to the liquid in which yeast grows) or from fermented solutions of grains, potatoes, malt, or sugar. Each method was problematic and unpredictable. In the late 1700s, Holland became the first country to produce a compressed baker's yeast from spirit distilleries. The Viennese refined the process shortly thereafter. In fact, it was an Austrian, Charles Fleischmann, who brought yeast manufacturing to America. By patenting a compressed yeast cake in the late 1860s, he made home baking far less frustrating and started an empire that thrives to this day. In response to the need to feed American troops abroad during World War II, Fleischmann's company went on to create active dry yeast. Active dry yeast requires no refrigeration and can be activated simply by adding warm water. In the 1970s, Europeans took the virtues and convenience of dry yeast one step further when they created instant yeast. Dry and long-lived, instant yeast requires no proofing. Despite indications to the contrary-created by the commercial largesse of the yeast companies-there remain to this day only these three types of yeast: fresh, active dry, and instant. All are derived from the powerful brewer's yeast known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but each is processed from a slightly different strain of this protypical yeast.
The original commercial yeast, known as fresh or compressed, is about 70 percent water by weight and is composed of 100 percent living cells. It is soft and crumbly and requires no proofing-fresh yeast will dissolve if it is simply rubbed into sugar or dropped into warm liquid. Owing to qualities associated with its strain, fresh yeast will produce the most carbon dioxide of all three types of yeasts during fermentation. Fresh yeast is considered fast, potent, and reliable, but has somewhat of a drawback: it is perishable and must be
refrigerated.
Active dry and instant yeasts arrive at their granular state by undergoing processes that reduce them to 95 percent dry matter. Traditional active dry yeast is exposed to heat so high that many of its cells are destroyed in the process. Because the spent outer cells encapsulate living centers, active dry yeast must first be dissolved in a relatively hot liquid (proofed) to slough off dead cells and reach the living centers.
Instant yeast, on the other hand, is subjected to a gentler drying process. As a result, every dried particle is living, or active. This means the yeast can be mixed directly with recipe ingredients without first being dissolved
in water. It is in this context that the yeast is characterized as "instant." With one-third less instant yeast than
active dry yeast required for the purposes of most recipes, instant yeast has earned a reputation as a stronger yeast. It combines the potency of fresh yeast with the convenience of active dry, and it is considered by some to have a cleaner flavor than active dry because it contains no dead cells. (In our months of testing, we found this to be true when we made a lean baguette dough but could detect no difference in flavor when using the two yeasts in doughs made with milk, sugar, and butter.) Though instant yeast was not developed to create a quicker rise, it is often marketed and used as such in the United States. This is because it is more potent than active dry. When recipes call for yeast without distinguishing instant from active dry, the instant will rise more rapidly. But it is best used in judicious amounts, as we discovered in our kitchen tests.

Everything That Rises Must Converge
Given the apparent differences in the three types of yeast, we were shocked when our initial series of tests with an American sandwich bread recipe turned up nothing noteworthy. We had assumed that doughs made with different types of yeast would perform differently or produce breads with individual flavors or textures. But for all
intents and purposes, the breads we baked were identical. Tasters had to literally bury their noses in the crumb of the bread to establish olfactory differences-but these differences did not translate to the tongue. Proceeding one step further, we put individual brands of yeast into competition. After all, yeast companies themselves scramble to come up with proprietary formulas-of the hundreds of artificially created strains of yeast, some are even housed in a national repository-so there must be qualitative differences, right? Wrong. We found no perceptible differences in the breads baked with different brands of yeast. Realizing at this point that we had to rethink our testing strategy, we decided to advance to the second round by using only instant yeast--selecting it because it is widely available, convenient, and strong-and attempt to come up with some pointers for home bakers on how to make sense of and use these putty-colored granules.

Control Fermentation before It Controls You As noted above, one misconception about instant yeast arises from the recommendations of the yeast
companies themselves, which often call for quantities far in excess of what is required. When a recipe calls for instant yeast in amounts comparable with those of active dry (usually an envelope), the dough will rise faster because instant yeast contains no dead cells. But is that a good thing? The equation between less yeast and more flavorful bread has been long established in Europe. In her remarkable book English Bread and Yeast Cookery (Penguin Books, 1977), Elizabeth David cites Eliza Acton, writing in the 1845 book Modern Cookery, as having observed that rapid fermentation brought on by excess yeast is "by no means advantageous to the bread, which not only becomes dry and stale from it, but is of less sweet and pleasant flavor than that which is more slowly fermented." Unfortunately, many Americans over the years have come to associate raw yeasty smells and flavor with hearth and home-in a word, with homemade.
Understanding the relationship between yeast and fermentation, we learned, creates practical advantages for the baker. The less yeast employed, the longer the fermentation required. A long fermentation at a moderately cool temperature means the yeast can go about its business without being rushed. The fermentation flavors will improve. The bread will taste better. Instead of fearing that your dough will exhaust its resources if it rises slowly, relax-throw it in the fridge overnight if it suits you.
In embracing the axiom that a dough's rising time can be manipulated by adjusting the amount of yeast used and the temperature of the surrounding environment, one becomes considerably less time- and recipe-bound. Consider a bread recipe that uses a high proportion of yeast: the dough rises quickly. Offer this heavily yeasted dough a tropical rising spot, toss in a pinch of neglect by forgetting about it, and what will you get? In terms of the first rise, according to food scientist Shirley Corriher, bacteria produced in an excessively warm environment will create "short acid chains," which corrupt the bread's flavor. In terms of the final rise (once the dough is shaped), such a dough will be stretched to its limits. Gas will escape during baking, and the baked bread will resemble the above-mentioned sneaker-with an open grain and poor texture. Cool fermentation thus has the added advantage of reducing the margin of error if bread is left to rise for too long.
We tested these theories ourselves using the dinner roll recipe from the November/ December 1999 issue of Cook's. We made two original recipes, each of which used one envelope of instant yeast (21/4 teaspoons) and 3 1/2 cups of flour. We also made a recipe with only 3/4 teaspoon instant yeast. We gave the dough with less yeast an initial two-hour rise at room temperature, followed by an overnight fermentation. As for the two original doughs, one was handled as the recipe instructed while the second was given twice as much time for the first rise (in a warm oven) as well as the second rise (after being formed). The results were instructive. Once baked, the orginal-recipe rolls that were left for double the usual rising time looked squat and dispirited, their interior was heavy, and their flavor frankly sour-"indescribably awful," one taster said. The regular rolls were as
we remembered them: sweet, yeasty, and pillowy soft. One taster described them as "a yeast explosion in my mouth." But the rolls with less yeast and a long fermentation had improved height, a complex, lingering aroma,
a fine interior crumb, and a richer flavor. "You can taste the yeast," one taster said, "but the flavor is developed and full, not so in your face."
And so we found ourselves at the end of the day with a handful of rough gems. First, we like instant yeast (to include those brands whose names imply haste-rapid rise, instant rise, and so on): it has a long shelf life, does not need to be activated by dissolving it in water, and is "stronger," which means you can use less. Second, we learned that less yeast makes better bread precisely because it takes longer to rise. We recognize that fermentation is something a baker can control by decreasing the amount of yeast and
increasing the rising time. And, last but not least, we confirm that a kitchen that smells of just-baked bread will always draw a crowd.

Dixie Diner sells a product called "Egg (Not!)" which is simply ground lecithin. Find it on their web site (http://www.dixieusa.com/) under Baking Ingredients:

Dixie's Official Egg (Not!)T
A dairy-free, animal-free egg replacer that's made only from soybeans. Stores dry, just add 1 rounded teaspoon to 2 tablespoons water to make a one egg replacement. Use for baking and cooking. The easiest and most economical egg replacer you will find. Don't try to make a souffle out of it unless you add egg whites, though, even Egg (Not!)T has its limits. One gram of fat and 17.5 calories per teaspoon. Makes g reat meatballs...replaces oil or fat in baking, too! Many recipes included. (Kosher)

A Word About Egg (Not!)T

The only ingredient in Egg (Not!)T is, of course, pure soy lecithin (dried to produce a granular, easy to use form). Two very important phospholipids (membranes, the dynamic action centers of the living cell, are built on phospholipids) have been isolated within the soy lethicin. Phosphatidyl choline (PC) is the major building block of liver cells; detoxification is necessary to counteract pollutants, viruses, alcohol, and other toxic agents - this is your liver's job. Phosphatidyl serine (PS) is a brain-cell nutrient that boosts memory and speeds both concentration andlearning, as well as enhancing mood. It is the only nutrient proven to partially reverse age-related memory impairment. It also eases muscle pain associated with physical stress. Even add a teaspoon full to your next smoothie or power drink - sprinkle it in your soups and baked goods - just use it, your liver and your brain need it!


I have put lecithin granules (which I purchased at the health food store) in my blender and used it as an egg replacer. Use 1 teaspoon with 2 tablespoons water for each egg in your recipes. It works great.

Knead the salt into the dough. Turn it out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough, adding as little additional flour as possible (about 2 tablespoons) until it is smooth and strong, 5-10 minutes.

Place dough in a container at least 3 times its size and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it ferment in a warm place until about doubled in size but not to the point of collapsing, about 2 hours.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Lightly coat the dough with flour. Cut into 18 pieces. Round the pieces into smooth balls and place them on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets. Let the rolls proof for 1 to 1-1/2 hours until double.

Slash or snip the tops of the rolls, if desired. Bake in a 450F oven until the rolls are golden. After 10 minutes, rotate baking sheets and switch positions from top and bottom racks. Bake until rolls are dark brown all around, about 5 minutes more. Let cool on a rack.

  1                BIG  A
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached bread flour -- (16 ounces)
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast -- or 1 1/4 teaspoon
                        active dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  cool water

  1              pound  polenta
                        -- (coarse not finely milled cornmeal)
  1              pound  rolled oats
     1/4         pound  wheat bran

1) Measure out the refrigerated biga and let it sit out for 1 hour to take the chill off. Cut it into small pieces.
2) Combine the biga with the other dough ingredients in a mixing bowl by hand or in the bowl of an electric mixer with a dough hook. If making by hand, stir until all the ingredients gather and form a ball. Then turn the dough out onto a floured counter and knead for about 12 minutes. If using a machine, mix on low speed for 1 minute, then increase to medium and mix for 10 additional minutes. As you mix or knead, the dough will lost its coarse, gruel-like texture and become smooth. The dough is ready when it passes the windowpane test and feels neutral to the touch (77 to 80 degrees). It should be tacky but not sticky, with the grains dispersed throughout.
3) Put the dough in a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 90 minutes or till it doubles in size.
4) Grease a loaf pan (9 by 5). Gently shape the dough into a sandwich loaf and place it in the pan seam side down.
5) If topping with poppy seeds, fold up a wet, clean towel and roll it over the top of the loaf, then sprinkle on the topping. It will stick to the wet dough.
6) Mist the loaf lightly with cooking spray. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap or enclose it in a plastic bag. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, till it crests above the pan, doming but not mushrooming over the sides.
7) Position an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven, but not on the bottom rung. Preheat the oven to 350.
8) Place the loaf in the center of the rack and bake for 20 minutes. Turn the loaf front to back to insure even browning, and bake for 25 to 35 minutes more. The bread is done when the crust is a deep golden brown on all sides, the loaf sounds hollow when thwacked on the bottom, and the internal dough temperature is about 185. If the bread seems too soft, remove it from the pan and finish it directly on the oven rack; it will brown very quickly.
9) Remove the bread from the oven to a cooling rack, and let it cool for 90 minutes before slicing.

First note:

BIGA
3 1/2 cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread flour
1 teaspoon instant yeast, or 1 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups cool water (65 to 70 degrees)

1) Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Stir with a wooden or metal spoon until the dough forms a ball.
2) Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until the flour is fully incorporated and the dough is smooth and tacky but not sticky. Add a little more flour or water if necessary to achieve this consistency.0
3) Place the dough in a clean bowl large enough to accommodate doubling. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or enclose it in a plastic bag, and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for about 3 to 5 hours, or till the dough increases in size at least 1 1/2 times.
4) Use immediately or punch down, cover with plastic wrap (or put it back in the plastic bag), and retard in the refrigerator overnight.

You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to three days, so could make three or four loaves (depending on how much biga you have). You can also freeze some of it. I cut it into 8 ounce portions and freeze in individual freezer bags. He recommends mixing it one day and freezing it on the next day if you are going to save it.

Second note:
I always use a lot more flour than he mentions. I end up adding almost another entire cup. Not sure if that's a typo or I'm doing something wrong, but that's been my experience.

Third note:

MULTIGRAIN BLEND

1 pound polenta (coarse, not finely milled cornmeal)
1 pound rolled oats
1/4 pound wheat bran

This can be mixed ahead of time and kept in a storage container or in a plastic bag in the freezer. Other grains that can be substituted include triticale flakes, wheat flakes, amaranth, quinoa, and rye flakes. Large grains such a rice, bulgur, steel-cut oats, millet, buckwheat groats, or barley must be cooked and cooled first, and can be added as an additional ingredient, staying within the flour to grain ratio (65 to 80 percent bread flour, 20 to 35 percent grain blend described below. He does not recommend finely milled grains like rice flour, cornmeal, or rye flour in the multigrain blend as they dull the bright color of the loaf.

Regardless of the blend, the key is to keep it in proportion to the rest of the dough. To retain the best structure, the dough needs 65 to 80 percent bread (or high-gluten) flour.

NOTES : It's a bit of extra work, but utterly worth it. It's actually gotten me away from using my bread machine except to knead the dough. Before finding this recipe, I was a hard core bread machine user who thought baking in the oven was not worth the trouble. This recipe made me change my mind. [Leigh]
