  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  whole wheat flour (3 to 3 1/2 cups)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           envelope  Fleischmann's(r) Quick-Rise Instant Yeast
     3/4           cup  low-fat (2%) milk
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  liquid honey
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

In large bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups flour, salt and undissolved yeast. In small
saucepan heat milk, water, vegetable oil and honey until very warm (125F). Stir warm liquids into dry ingredients. Stir in eggs; blend well. Mix in enough remaining flour to make soft dough that begins to come away from sides
of bowl and can be handled. Texture may be crumbly. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Roll dough (or stretch and pat) to 12- x 8-inch rectangle. Roll up from short
side as for jelly roll. Pinch seam and ends to seal. Place, seam side down, in greased 9- x 5-inch loaf pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Bake in 350F oven for 40 minutes or until done. Remove from pan to wire rack to cool.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  whole wheat flour (8 to 8 1/2 cups)
  2           packages  Fleischmann's(r) Active Dry Yeast or Rapid
                        Rise Yeast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dough:
  1           kilogram  Bread flour
                        -- (plus approx 50 gm for kneading)
  55             grams  Potato starch
  15                gm  SAF yeast -- (3 tsps)
     1/4           can  Warm water
     1/2      teaspoon  Sugar
     1/2           cup  Fresh milk
  1 1/4           cups  Warm water

                        ---
                        Asado Filling:
  500            grams  Pork (with skin and fat) -- diced in small
                        -- pieces
     1/2           cup  Soy sauce
  4             cloves  Garlic -- minced
  1               tsp.  Black pepper
     1/4          tsp.  Salt
  1                     Bay leaf -- crumbled into large
                        -- pieces
  2       small pieces  Star anise
     1/3           cup  Sugar
  1                cup  Water
                        ---
  2        tablespoons  Cornstarch
     1/4           cup  Water

Dough:

1. Proof yeast in 1/4 cup water and 1/4 tsp. sugar.

2. Sift together 3 cups flour with the potato starch. In a mixer blend together sugar, shortening, proofed yeast, eggs, flour and salt. Mix at medium speed until well blended and slightly thickened. Stir in enough flour (by hand) using a large rubber spatula to make a soft dough. Dump in well floured working table and knead in remaining flour until you end up with a very smooth, pliable dough. Round out the dough.

3. Place dough in a well greased bowl and let it rise for 1 1/2 hours or until double. (You can give it two risings).

4. Punch down and place in a greased work table. Cut out 75 gm pieces, roll and rest for about 10 minutes. Flatten each piece with your palm and with the heel of your right hand flatten the outer edges to make a rough round shape (middle part should be thicker than the edges). Place about a tablespoon of filling in the center and spread with a spoon. Gather edges together and seal top by pinching. You should come out with a round bun. Place in large greased muffin tins and flatten top slightly. Cover with a large greased plastic and set aside to rise for at least 1 1/2 hours or until almost double.

5. When oven is preheated to 350*F paint the tops with 1 egg beaten with 2 teaspoons milk. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Remove buns from tins and cool completely. Yield: 24 pieces.

Asado Filling:
1. Place pork pieces in a casserole or saucepan and mix in all ingredients except 1 C water. Marinate for at least 30 minutes.

2. Pour in water, boil at medium heat, mixing occasionally. Simmer at low heat for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until pork is very tender and liquid seems thick. If necessary add a tablespoon more of water and continue simmering.

3. Prepare cornstarch mixture and add to pork. Mix well but do not boil as this might make the fat separate from the sauce. Sauce should be very thick. Cool completely before using. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead, refrigerate).

Notes:
- Fish out the anise seed and bay leaf BEFORE scooping into the dough.
- I use a small ice cream scooper to fill the dough.
- Make sure none of the filling comes in contact with the edges of the dough
before you close it, it will be impossible to seal it if it does.
- I bake the buns in large ensaimada molds, I think they look like brioche
molds, but I'm not sure. They come out very attractive with grooves on the
side.
- Filipinos generally don't like bread that's too brown so I usually cover
the tops with a greased foil after 12 minutes of baking.
- This roll stays fresh and soft for 4 days at room temperature sealed in
plastic.

NOTES : Here is a favorite savory roll recipe which I also use to make cheese bread.
The dough is very forgiving and stays fresh for 4 days (each roll sealed in
plastic). The filling can be used to stuff steamed buns (sio-pao) - a
favorite Filipino dim-sum. You can fill the dough with all sorts of fillings
like longganisa (sausage), chorizo, tuna, corned beef...

                White Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  cool water
                        -- (70° to 75°)
  2               pkg.  active dry yeast
  6               cups  bread flour -- (6 to 6 3/4)
                        -- or unbleached all-purpose flour
  2               tsp.  salt
  1                     egg white
  2              Tbsp.  water

Bread flour, toasted sesame seed, poppy seed, and/or toasted wheat germ In a large mixing bowl stir together the 21/2 cups water and yeast. Let stand about 3 minutes or till mixture looks creamy. With a freestanding electric mixer or by hand with a spoon, add 3 to 4 cups of the flour, a little at a time, mixing on low speed at first and then on medium speed. (This will take about 10 minutes.) Sprinkle the salt over the dough during the last minute of mixing.

If your mixer has a dough hook, continue to add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, till the dough clings together and cleans the side of the bowl. Continue mixing on medium speed about 5 minutes to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic. Or, to knead by hand, with a spoon stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes total).

Shape the dough into a ball. Place dough in a large greased bowl; turn once to grease surface of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place till double (11/2 to 2 hours). Or, cover and chill overnight. Punch the dough down and knead gently in the bowl just a few strokes. Cover and let rise again till nearly double (3/4 to 1 hour in a warm place, or 11/2 to 2 hours in the refrigerator). Punch dough down again and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 4 equal portions. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

To shape loaves, work with 1 portion of dough at a time, leaving others covered. Flatten 1 portion with the heel of your hand to about an 8x4-inch rectangle, pressing out air bubbles as you go. Bring up the long edges of the dough and pinch together to close the seam, gently stretching the loaf lengthwise as you work (see photo, left). Pat the dough flat again, then repeat pinching and stretching to make a 17 -inch-long loaf that is about 2 inches in diameter. If the dough becomes too bouncy and shrinks back as you work with it, let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes and continue with another portion of dough. (The dough will be easier to shape after it rests.) Place each loaf, seam side down, in a greased baguette pan* or place loaves 3 to 4 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place till nearly double (3/4 to 1 hour).

Preheat oven to 450° and adjust 2 oven racks so that one is in the lowest position and the other is in the middle of the oven. With a sharp'# knife or clean razor blade, cut 4 or 5 diagonal slashes in each loaf, about 1/4 inch deep. Combine egg white and the 2 tablespoons water; brush atop loaves. Dust with flour or sprinkle with other toppings.

For a crisper crust, place a broiler pan on the bottom oven rack while the oven preheats. When the pan is hot, carefully pour about 1 cup of hot tap water into the pan in the oven. Be careful of the hot steam.

Place bread in the oven on the middle rack. (If you don't have room to bake all of the loaves at once, place the others, covered, in the refrigerator, removing 10 minutes before baking time. Repeat heating broiler pan and adding water for each batch.) Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or till loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. The water in the pan will evaporate after about 10 minutes of baking time; remove dry pan to avoid warping.

Transfer loaves to wire racks; cool completely. Serve within 12 hours or wrap in freezer wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Makes 4 baguettes (20 slices per loaf).

To reheat and crisp bread: Thaw bread, if frozen. Unwrap and place directly on the rack in a preheated 400° oven. Bake for 10 minutes or till crisp and heated through.

*Note: Specially designed baguette pans give the loaves their typical round shape. Baking sheets give the same delicious results, but produce loaves with flat bottoms.

NOTES : When I leave to rise for the second time, it should be left until they are almost doubled in bulk, but not quite. The time depends on how hot and humid it is. An easy test is to take a small ball of dough and drop in a glass of room temperature water, when it floats to the top, it's ready. It will probably take longer than 15 min in a cold place.

  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/3           cups  lukewarm water (about 105 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  4               cups  bread flour plus more if
                        necessary

1. In the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with a dough-hook
attachment, combine yeast, sugar, and water, and stir to blend. Let stand
until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the oil and salt.

2. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until most

of the flour has been absorbed, and the dough forms a ball. Continue to mix

at the lowest speed until soft and satiny but still firm, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add
additional flour, if necessary, to keep the dough from sticking. The dough
will be quite soft.

3. Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and place

in the refrigerator. Let the dough rise in the refrigerator until doubled
or
tripled in bulk, 8 to 12 hours. The dough can be kept for 2 to 3 days in
the
refrigerator. Simply punch down the dough as it doubles or triples. Proceed

with the individual recipes for bread tart or fougasse.

                        Dough:
  1           envelope  yeast
     1/4           cup  lukewarm water
     1/2           cup  sugar

  1              pound  dried pears -- (about 4 cups)
  1                cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
                        Grated rind and juice of 1 lemon
     1/2          tsp.  nutmeg
     1/2          tsp.  cinnamon
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  kirsch

Yield:  1 large bread.  Can be frozen.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Proof the yeast in the lukewarm water with the sugar. Scald the milk and stir in the butter to melt. Let stand until lukewarm.

Add the milk-and-butter to the yeast sponge; then add the salt and the egg and stir in the flour, cup by cup.

Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead until elastic and smooth but still soft. Place the dough in a large buttered bowl, cover with a towel and let stand in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Meanwhile, place the dried pears in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the pears are softened.

Pour the water off and put the pears and the raisins through the coarse blade on a meat grinder, or blend in a blender. 	"Stir in the walnuts, grated lemon rind and juice, the spices, sugar and kirsch. Stir until you have a smooth paste.

Now, with a rolling pin, roll out the dough on your work surface until it is about 18" long on each side, forming a square. Spread the fruit paste as evenly as you can on top and roll up, jelly-roll fashion. Place the roll on a buttered baking sheet, cover with a towel and let stand in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size. Bake until golden, about 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a rack. Wait at least 1 day before slicing.

Do not serve this bread fresh.  It tastes best when it is a few days old.  You might experiment by using mixed dried fruit instead of just dried pears.

  2               cups  all purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/3           cup  shortening
                        -- (Crisco preferred)
  1 1/4           cups  sweet milk

baking pan: 1 baking sheet Teflon greased or lined with parchment paper

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. This is a hot oven.

in a mixing or mixer bowl, sift together the dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening with your fingers, a pastry blender* or 2 knives or with the mixer flat beater. Pour in all the milk at once. Stir with a fork or beater blade until just mixed. Add more milk if the dough is dry. The dough will be quite wet but able to retain its shape.

Gather the dough into a ball; place on a floured surface and lightly sprinkle with flour, if necessary, to prevent sticking. Work with your hands a moment or so to pull all the dough pieces together. Dust again if necessary.

Roll with a rolling pin to 1/2 inch thickness, cut with a cookie or biscuit cutter**
into 3 inch rounds & place the biscuits on the baking sheet. Knead any scraps gently together and cut again.

If the dough is too wet to roll without sticking, for each biscuit. pinch off pieces of dough Dust lightly with flour and pat into shape on baking sheet.

Bake on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.

Remove the biscuits from the oven and serve right away.

* I usually us a pastry blender
** I think King Arthur is right about their biscuit cutters - mine do rise higher than they did when I was using a glass to cut the biscuits.

NOTES : I hope y'all can stand one more cinnamon roll recipe. this one was from Cooking Light and is one of the few of their breads which reheats successfully for me (I like their breakfast breads very well the first day, but haven't found them to keep well). I often have a bunch of these in the freezer for breakfasts to come. they're not the traditional roll-up roll, but you can afford to indulge in them more often! (The title was from the theme of the article, foods in famous movies.

This was supposed to be the roll that Audrey Hepburn (?) nibbled on while pressing her nose against Tiffany's display window.)

  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  caraway seed

Make sponge..cover and let sit overnight.

Stir other ingredients into sponge. I use KA mixer. Let rise twice at room temp. Form into traditional rye loaves. PLACE ON CORNMEAL COVERED PARCHMENT...cover with towel. Or place in 2 bread pan loaves (greased of course).

After double, glaze with egg white/milk or cornstarch glaze from Secrets of a Jewish Baker. Make slashes. Bake at 425F for 15 min ..Lower heat to 400F and bake another 15 - 30 min depending on size of loves..

While bringing 1 cup water to a boil, dissolve 2 Tbsp cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water; whisk into boiling water until mixture thickens. Brush on loaf before slashing & placing in the oven, and again as soon as you take the bread out of the oven.

This glaze makes a wonderful crackling sound as the bread cools, a fine reason to sit down and enjoy your blessings after a hard day at the breadboard!


Flour measurements are approximate. I sometimes add some KA pumpernickel flour. You bread makers know how the dough should look and feel. Please excuse format but it is my recipe file format only with a bigger font.

  1                cup  warm water -- plus
     3/4           cup

In a mixing bowl, stir 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup semolina and salt together. In a measuring cup, mix yeast in 1 cup water and stir to dissolve. Mix liquid with flour mixture to form doughy batter. Let sit covered overnight in the warmest place in the kitchen.

Place baking tile in oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Make a well on a work surface with 2 cups flour and 1/4 cup semolina. Place doughy batter in center and stir in remaining warm water. Mix well and incorporate flour from edges of well until a dough is formed. Bring together and knead 10 minutes, until firm and elastic. Place in a bowl, cover with a towel and let rest 1 hour. Dough should double in size. Cut dough into tennis ball-sized pieces and, using a rolling pin, roll out to 12 to 14-inch circles, about 1/8th to 1/4-inch thin. Place on peel and slide onto oven tiles and bake 2 minutes. Open oven door and turn over. Cook 30 seconds more and remove to board. Bread should be puffed up like a balloon. Immediately cut around edges with a knife to separate top and bottom layers.

Stack the 2 pieces on a kitchen towel and put a box of cereal on top of them to weigh them down. Continue this process until all the dough is cut, baked, separated and stacked. Place each half back into the oven, one at a time, for 15 to 20 seconds, until very crisp. Store wrapped in a brown paper bag. They will last three to four weeks in a dry place.

Mix and sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa and cinnamon; add to creamed mixture alternately with the buttermilk, beating until blended after each addition. Stir in raisins and nuts. Turn into a greased bread pan ( 9x5x2 3/4 inch). Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) 1 hour or until done. Cool on a wire rack. Spread with softened cream cheese if desired.

I thought of doing this with the Reeses peanut butter chips, but then the hubby would complain (he's not a peanut butter fan - or a nut fan, which explains why I don't put the nuts in) - I also leave out anything additional & it's just fine like that...
it's good & not too sweet...

NOTES : this is from the 1983 printing of "Hershey's 1934 Cookbook", which I believe I bought as a promotional item in 1983 (you know, send in the proofs of purchases)...I generally don't put in the raisins & nuts, but I do add mini chocolate chips...

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        -- BIGA (starter or sponge):
  1                cup  room-temperature water -- plus
  1              Tbls.  room-temperature water
  1            package  dry yeast
                        -- (or approx 1 Tblsp bulk dry yeast)
  3 1/3           cups  bread flour
                        -- (or add 1 tsp. vital wheat gluten to
                        -- each cup of white flour)
                        ---
                        DOUGH
  1                Big  a from above
     3/4           cup  room-temperature water -- plus
  2              Tblsp  room -temperature water
  1              Pinch  dry yeast
     1/2           cup  semolina flour -- plus
  3              Tblsp  semolina flour
                        -- (the kind you use to make pasta)
  2 1/2           tsp.  salt

Makes 2 loaves

For biga: Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over and let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup flour, whisk or stir until well-blended. Add another cup of flour, blend well. Add remaining 1 1/3 cups flour and incorporate (dough will be firm). (Preceding can also be accomplished in food processor, be sure to keep sides scraped down between additions.) Gather dough into a ball, place in large bowl if you used your processor to mix it; cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight. The biga will soften, resembling thick oatmeal in texture.

For dough:
Pull biga into walnut-size pieces; place in a clean, large bowl. Add water, yeast and semolina flour. Using one hand, squeeze ingredients together for 2 minutes. Work the dough 4 minutes by scooping sections from sides of bowl and pressing into the center, blending into a very soft, shaggy mass. Using spatula, scrape dough from sides of bowl into center. Let dough rest in bowl, uncovered, 10 minutes.

Sprinkle salt over the dough. Using one hand, knead dough by rotating bowl 1/4 turn at a time, scooping dough from sides and folding down into center until dough starts to come away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Scrape dough from hand and sides of bowl. Cover with towel and let dough rest in bowl 20minutes.

Rotating bowl 1/4 turn at a time, fold dough over onto itself 6 times; turn dough over in bowl. Cover with towel and let dough rest in bowl 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425*. Sprinkle work surface with additional semolina. Turn dough out onto semolina. Using pastry scraper or large knife, cut dough in half; keep halves separated (easier said than done!). Let stand, uncovered, 20 minutes.

Sprinkle two large baking sheets (cookie sheets are fine) with additional semolina (I usually spray 'em first just for safety). Transfer each dough half, semolina side up, to one sheet. Stretch each dough half to 15 x 4" rectangle. press fingertips into dough in several places to dimple the surface (characteristic of this bread). Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool.

You can top this before baking with anything from Kosher salt to caramelized onions -- fresh herbs are great -- and have a fine offering for a luncheon or for an evening snack! (You can get semolina in most "organic" food stores in bulk, or Williams-Sonoma by the bag. If it's too discouraging to find that particular thing, you could try substituting corn meal; the flavor would be a little different, but the crunchiness should come out about the same.)

NOTES : To develop holes, you want a very loose dough that plops down on your baking sheet and doesn't rise much. You'll see in the following recipe you never knead in the tradition way -- on the board -- at all! If you want the classic 'Italian bread" or baguette shape, you need the special pans to shape this loose type of dough. Here's a Ciabatta recipe from Bon Appetit 1/99, which gets rave reviews when put out instead of chips with dip...

  6               cups  all-purpose flour (6 to 6 1/2 cups)
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2           packages  Fleischmann's(r) Rapid Rise Yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine -- plus
  6        tablespoons  butter or margarine

  1 1/2           cups  100% bran cereal
  1                cup  chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  packed light brown sugar
  3          teaspoons  ground cinnamon

In large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, granulated sugar, undissolved yeast and
salt. Heat milk, water and 1/3 cup butter until very warm (125 to 130F).
Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric
mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes
at high speed. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough.
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8
minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, process bran cereal in blender or food processor for 30 to 60
seconds or until ground and reduced to 1 cup (some coarse pieces will
remain). Reserve.
On lightly floured surface, divide dough in half. Roll each to 16- x 7-inch
rectangle. Melt 3 tablespoons butter; brush on rectangles to within 1/2 inch
of edges. Sprinkle evenly with 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 3/4
cup ground bran and 3/4 cup nuts. Roll up tightly from short ends as for
jelly roll; pinch seams and ends to seal.
Spray two 8 1/2- x 4 1/2-inch loaf pans with cooking spray. Place loaves,
seam sides down, in pans. Spray top of loaves with cooking spray. Cover; let
rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/4 cup ground bran, 1/4 cup nuts, 1/4 cup brown
sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in small bowl. Cut in remaining 3 tablespoons
butter until mixture is crumbly. Reserve.
Lightly beat egg white; brush loaves. Sprinkle with reserved bran mixture.
Bake at 375F for 40 to 45 minutes or until done, covering with foil after 25
minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from pans; cool on wire rack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all purpose flour -- plus more if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast -- (2 1/4 teaspoon)
  1                cup  very warm water (about 120F)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided

1) in a large bowl, combine the flour and salt; set aside. In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar & yeast in the water. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the water mixture, then add to the flour. Mix with your hands until a soft ball forms.

2) knead on a lightly floured surface for 5 to 7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time.

3) place the dough in a bowl that has been coated with nonstick vegetable spray; turn the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature for 45 to 50 minutes, until doubled in size.

4) Punch the dough down.

5) coat a 12 inch deep dish pizza pan or a 12 inch round cake pan with nonstick vegetable spray. Using your fingertips or the heel of your hand, spread the dough so that it covers the bottom of the pan and dough comes three quarters of the way up the sides.

6) cover with plastic wrap & let sit for 10 minutes.

7) uncover & brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.

makes one pound of dough

at this point I bake it about 10 minutes at about 350F, but I would imagine you could just top your pizza & bake it. I usually wind up making 2 thinner crust pizzas with this dough. I have tried a few recipes for dough but my family likes this one the best. I have made it in the bread machine, but using the standard (for my machine) protocol - liquids, than flour, etc - I keep my eye on it to see if it needs a little extra flour but generally it's fine - I take it out to rise...

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        For the dough:
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  yellow corn meal
  3        tablespoons  Lora Brody's Dough Relaxer
  2               cups  unbleached all purpose flour
  1                cup  white wheat flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  mild chili powder
  1                cup  canned vegetarian refried beans -- (10 ounces)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil or mild chili oil
  1                     extra large egg or equal amount of egg
                        substitute
  1         tablespoon  molasses
     2/3           cup  water -- plus
                        additional water
                        if necessary to make a smooth soft ball
                        of dough after the first five minutes of
                        kneading

To complete and bake the Pizza:
2 cups (16 ounces) chunky salsa, drained of some of the liquid to make a
thick consistency, mild medium, or hot, as you wish
2 eight ounce packages low-fat, or fat-free cream cheese
1 generous cup low-fat shredded cheddar or Jack cheese (I find that the kind
from Cabot Farms has wonderful flavor and melts without getting stringy.)
On a lightly floured work surface roll or pat the dough into a 14" circle.
Fit the dough into a lightly oiled 12 or 13 inch deep dish pizza pan. Push
the edges up the sides of the pan. Spread the bottom of the dough with the
cream cheese, spread salsa over the cream cheese,
sprinkle with the cheese. Place the pizza in a warm place to rise for 30
minutes, then bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-25 minutes or until the
crust is deep brown and the cheese is bubbling.
 A great way to raise dough in a hurry is to run an empty dishwasher on the
rinse cycle. Open the door to allow a small amount of steam to escape, then
quickly place
your bread or pizza on the upper rack. Close the dough (making sure the
machine does not re-start). Check after 15 minutes - your bread or pizza
should be ready to bake.

NOTES : Your crowd loves pizza; your crowd loves Mexican food; your crowd has been known to consume massive amounts of food in a very short time. Here's the answer to all those challenges - in one easy-to-make recipe! You can make the dough several days or even weeks ahead. After the first rise, punch it down, place it in a gallon size heavy duty recloseable plastic bag and freeze. Defrost at room temperature before proceeding.

Here  is my favorite pizza recipe.  I'd be happy to send a sample of my Dough
Relaxer to anyone who would like to try it.

for dough: pour warm water into large mixing bowl; add yeast and stir until combined. Combine whole wheat flour with 2 1/4 cups white flour and salt, stir into yeast mixture 1 cup at a time. Add yogurt and mix until soft and sticky (about 2 minutes).

Sprinkle flour onto kneading surface. Knead dough until smooth; about 5 minutes, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking. Place in large oiled bowl, turn; let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down, let rise again.

Meanwhile, make toppings:
for onion marmalade topping, preheat oven to 425F. Warm olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add onions, salt & pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until the onions begin to wilt, about 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix wine, vinegar, and broth in non-aluminum bowl. Pour liquid over onions. Sprinkle with sugar and bake until golden brown, about 1 hour. Stir every 5 minutes after 45 minutes have elapsed. Set aside to cool. Divide equally over 4 pizzas.

For artichoke topping, put cooked hearts into food processor. Add 1 T. lemon juice, 1.5 t. olive oil and puree until smooth. Reserve. Cut raw hearts into very thin match sticks and put in a glass/ceramic bowl. Add remaining lemon juice and olive oil, mint, salt and pepper and toss to combine. Divide puree equally over 4 pizzas; divide salad equally and top the 4 pizzas with salad.
Divide dough into 8 equal balls. Cover (refrigerate or freeze if not using within 2 hours).

Preheat oven to 425F. Roll out balls into individual pizzas; place on cornmeal-dusted baking sheets. Top with onion or artichoke topping; bake until dough is golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  rye flour
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  1                cup  finely chopped dill pickles
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  liquid drained from dill pickles
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  dill seeds
  2          teaspoons  caraway seeds
  1           teaspoon  salt

Combine flours in a large bowl; stir well. Combine 2 cups flour mixture and yeast in a large mixing bowl; stir well.

Combine chopped dill pickle and next 8 ingredients in a medium saucepan. Heat until dill pickle mixture reaches 120 to 130, stirring occasionally.

Gradually add liquid mixture to yeast mixture, beating at low speed of an electric mixer until blended. Beat 2 additional minutes at medium speed. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour mixture to make a soft dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes). Place in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85), free from drafts, 40 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
Punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough in half. Roll on portion of dough into a 14 x 7-inch rectangle. Roll up dough, starting at short side, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch ends to seal. Place dough, seam side down, in a well-greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Repeat procedure with remaining portion of dough.
Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 40 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
Bake at 350 for 40 to 45 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove bread from pans immediately; cool on wire racks.

NOTES : I know this is too late for this year's holiday, but I thought I would post
it anyway. This recipe comes from a book called "Homemade Bread" written by the Food Editors of the Farm Journal. Published in 1969, it was giving to me by my sister when I first expressed an interest in baking bread when I was 14 years old. I have not made this recipe for many years, but I do remember it was a hit, especially for the youngsters.

                        *****

Also, my tip for enhancing pizza with those big puffy irregular bubbles:

Start a sponge of approximately equal parts by volume of flour, filtered water with an added a pinch of yeast. I maintain this mixture in the fridge like a "sour", but I don't leave it at room temperature for long periods to attract wild yeasts and bacteria as I'm not looking for a sourdough effect. As I use it, I replenish the sponge with equal parts flour and water (no more yeast will be needed) and I allow it to come to room temp briefly just to start the yeasties "feeding frenzy" - then I put return into the refrigerator until next time. When I make pizza dough I take an unmeasured glob of this (I'd guess about 1/4 cup) and break it up for good distribution in the water. Also I decrease the amount of yeast the pizza dough recipe calls for by about 1/2. Not very scientific, but it adds lovely texture and flavor to the dough. If you leave it too long without replenishing and it doesn't react the fresh feeding of flour and water and/or or smells "off" - toss it and start again!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  very warm water -- 100 degrees
     2/3           cup  honey
     2/3           cup  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  dough enhancer
  3        tablespoons  vital gluten
  2          teaspoons  sea salt
  5               cups  fresh ground wheat flour
  3        tablespoons  yeast ( SAF)

Mix this in the BOSCH on setting # 1.  Let set until bubbly- at least 15
minutes and no more than 30 minutes.
Then add more fresh milled flour until the sides begin to clear, changing
to speed #2 when dough gets stiffer.  Begin timing your kneading now for
9-11 minutes.

Place dough with oiled hands onto oiled countertop.  Cover with towel and
let set for 25-35 minutes.  It will be huge!
Put dough into prepared pans and let rise (covered)  till just over the
top of the pans.

Bake at preheated oven of 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
I make 8  inch loaves, 10 inch loaves and 12 inch loaves- I have to cook
the larger loaves about 40 minutes. If you use Kamut it seems to take a
few minutes longer too!

Take loaves out of pans and let cool on rack.
TO BRAID:  Take enough dough for one loaf, make three long strips and
braid.  Enough from one loaf of dough for 2-3 long braids. Let rise for 30
mins, cook at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes.
Serve hot with FRESH COFFEE and enjoy!

                        Coarse cornmeal for baking sheet
  1 1/2         pounds  Basic Bread Dough (recipe above)
                        Olive oil or honey  for brushing on
                        fougasse

                        herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and basil,
                        for garnish

1. At least 40 minutes before placing the assembled fougasse in the oven,
preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

2. Punch down the prepared dough and divide it evenly into 5 pieces. Shape
each piece into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball of
dough
into an 8-by-5-inch rectangle. Using a pastry scraper, cut 3 or 4
lengthwise
slashes into the bread.

3. Sprinkle a baking sheet with coarse cornmeal, and carefully transfer the

rectangles of dough to the baking sheet. Gently pull apart at the slashes.
Cover with a clean towel, and let rest for 10 minutes.

4. Assemble the fougasse: Brush lightly with olive oil, then sprinkle with
preferred toppings like olives, herbs, oil-marinated capers, candied orange

peel and granulated sugar, herbes de Provence, or aniseed. Reduce oven
temperature to 450 degrees, and bake until golden and crusty, 25 to 30
minutes.

Note 1: thick slices brioche (1/2-3/4") -- optionally, you may cut each slice on the diagonal, making two triangles from each whole slice of bread

Preheat griddle or large cast-iron skillet.

Whisk together cream, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg in a shallow-bottom bowl or casserole dish.  Place sliced bread flat into dish, ensuring that each piece lays flat in liquid.  Turn the slices in the liquid until they are saturated but not falling apart.

Melt 2 T. unsalted butter in preheated griddle or skillet.  Place bread slices in skillet, ensuring that they are not overcrowded; cook until the underside is golden brown.  Turn the bread and cook on the second side until it is golden.  Serve immediately or keep warm in a 200F oven while you are cooking the rest of the bread slices.

Dust with powdered sugar, if desired.  These are excellent when served with maple syrup; bacon, ham, or sausages; and fresh fruit.

Makes:  6 slices (3-4 servings)

NOTES : Since we are on the subject of brioche, here is a recipe that I love to make when we have houseguests for breakfast or brunch. I have included it below. I typically like to make a large loaf of brioche in one of the larger-sized loaf pans. If I had a Pullman pan I might try that, too....just to get a uniformly square piece of bread that I could cut for the French toast pieces. Something to try for the future when I get one of those pans...

     1/4           cup  softened butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  sugar

                        -- (or 1 cup) with juice
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  2 1/2           tsp.  baking powder
     1/4          tsp.  baking soda

NOTES : I made this yesterday and changed the recipe to suit myself in the process. That makes it a "new" recipe which I am entitled to name, don't you think? My sixteen-year-old daughter Angela wouldn't even try this and griped that I make too many breads with "funky stuff" in them, so I'm naming this recipe accordingly.

I really liked it, even if Angela didn't.

Recipe By     :Jenna Holst

                Daily Bread Mailing List        Hand Made
                Vegetable & Herb Breads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water (105 to 115)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  5 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced scallion greens
  2          teaspoons  minced rosemary
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely grated sharp Cheddar cheese

1. In a bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar and let stand until foamy,
5 to 8 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the oil.
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour and the salt and make a well in the
center. Pour in the yeast mixture and stir well with a wooden spoon. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until it is smooth
and satiny, about 7 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a
lightly oiled bowl; turn the dough ball to coat it evenly with oil. Cover the
bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until
it is doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
3. Punch down the dough and knead it briefly while it is still in the bowl.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead again until
smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl and let rest, uncovered,
for 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive
oil. Add the garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until
softened but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes; set aside. In a small bowl, combine
the parsley, scallion greens, and rosemary.
5. Generously grease a 2 1/2-quart round cast-iron casserole or a 10-inch
skillet. Cut off a 1/2-cup-size piece of dough. Using a lightly floured
rolling pin, roll the small piece of dough into a 10- to 12-inch round. Fit
the dough round in the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the prepared
casserole. Roll out the remaining dough to a 22 x 15-inch rectangle.
6. Spread the garlic evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle
the herb mixture on the dough; spread the cheese evenly on top. Starting with
a long side, roll the dough into a log. Cut 1 inch off each end and discard.
Cut the log crosswise into 8 equal slices. Set 1 slice on its side in the
center of the dough-lined casserole and arrange the remaining 7 slices around
it. Let the dough rise, uncovered, until it is about 3 inches high, 1 to 1
1/2 hours.
7. Preheat the oven to 350. Bake the bread for 50 to 60 minutes, or until it
is golden brown on top. Run a knife around the edge of the casserole to
loosen the bread and then turn it out onto a rack. Using a clean kitchen
towel, turn the bread right side up and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before
slicing.

MAKE AHEAD: The baked bread can be wrapped and frozen for 1 week.

8x4x2-inch loaf pans, filling about 2/3 full. Bake in a 350F oven for 35 to
45 minutes for smaller loaves or about 45 minutes for larger loaves or till
toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire
racks for 10 minutes. Remove from pans; cool completely. Wrap and store
overnight at room temperature. Before serving, drizzle with Spiced Glaze.
Makes 5 smaller loaves or 2 larger loaves (about 25 slices).
Spiced Glaze: In a small mixing bowl stir together 1/2 cup sifted powdered
sugar and 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger. Stir in enough water (2 to 3
teaspoons) to produce an icing of  drizzling consistency.

  3                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  milk

Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Beat eggs, add milk, and stir gradually into flour to make a smooth batter. Beat thoroughly with egg beater. Fill greased custard cups or sizzling hot heavy metal muffin pans 2/3 full. Bake in a very hot oven (450F) for 15 minutes, then reduce to moderate heat (350F) and continue baking 20 minutes or until firm. Makes 12 large popovers.

For RICE popovers, use 3/4 cup mashed cooked rice instead of half the flour. Mix and bake as above. The recipe suggested using the popovers as patty shells to hold creamed mixtures.

     1/3           cup  butter or margarine
  2              large  shredded whole wheat cereal biscuits -- crumbled
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water (105 to 115)
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- (2 to 3)

Combine first 6 ingredients in a saucepan; heat until butter melts, stirring occasionally. Cool to 105 to 115. Combine yeast and warm water in a 1-cup liquid measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes.

Combine milk mixture, yeast mixture, and whole wheat flour in a large mixing bowl; beat at medium speed of an electric mixer until blended. Gradually stir in wheat germ and enough all-purpose flour to make a stiff dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Place dough in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover dough, and let rise in a warm place (85), free from drafts, 1 hour or until dough is doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and divide in half. Roll 1 portion of dough into a 14 x 6-inch rectangle. Roll up dough, starting at short side, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seams to seal. Place dough, seam side down, in a greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 3-inch loaf pan. Repeat procedure with remaining dough.
Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 35 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 400 for 25 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. (Cover with aluminum foil the last 5 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning, if necessary.) Remove from pans immediately; cool on wire racks.

  2               tsp.  salt
  2                     eggs
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2              pkgs.  dry yeast
  4               cups  flour -- (approximately)
  1                cup  cooked strained squash -- (optional)

Beat eggs; add sugar, salt, butter and squash. Over this pour hot milk and stir until butter is melted. When cooled to lukewarm, add yeast; work in flour, just enough that dough can be worked without being too sticky. Knead until smooth. Let dough rise until double, then work out on greased pans.

For cloverleaf rolls, put 3 little balls of dough into each muffin tin cup. For regular rolls, place on cookie sheet or pan, approximately 1/2 inch apart. Let rise until double. Bake at 350 degrees until golden brown and brush with butter.

  1                     egg beaten
                        FOR THE CROSSES AND GLAZE
  2               tbsp  plain flour
  1                tsp  milk
  2                tsp  castor sugar

PREPARATION 20 MINUTES
COOKING 40 MINUTES. PLUS 2 HOURS RISING

To make the "sponge"

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, yeast and sugar, then slowly beat in the milk to make a smooth batter Cover with plastic film and leave for about 20 minutes until frothy . This step is known as a "yeast hatter" and helps to make the loaf softer and lighter.

To make the bread

Add the rest of the ingredients (putting into the machine in the order preferred by your manufacturer) , make the dough using dough cycle on machine.

Butter a 900g/2lb loaf tin. Turn out the dough and knead a few times to knock out any air bubbles. Cut the dough into three equal pieces and shape each one into an oval the same width as the tin and a third of the length of the tin. Place the three pieces in the tin, then put it inside a large oiled food bag, allowing space for the dough to increase in size, and leave for about 45 minutes until risen to about 2.5cm/1inch above the top of the tin. Preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6/ tan oven 180C from cold (This is about 400F).


Make the crosses: take a small piping bag (or use a greaseproof paper bag). Mix the flour with five teaspoons of water to make a smooth paste. Spoon into the piping bag (if you are using a greaseproof paper bag, snip off one corner to make a hole). Pipe three crosses over the top of the loaf (picture 4). Bake in the centre of the oven for 20 minutes, then loosely cover with foil and bake for a further 15-20 minutes. To check the loaf is cooked, remove it from the tin and tap it underneath - it should sound hollow. If it doesn't, return it to the tin and bake for a further 5 minutes, then test again. Remove from the tin and set on a cooling rack.

Make the glaze: mix together the milk and caster sugar and brush over the hot loaf . Leave to cool before serving cut into slices and buttered. It is also great toasted for breakfast.

                        *****

Basically I take one morning or afternoon (preferably when not wearing black) and make up about 4 or 5 mixes of my own. I put them in gallon Ziploc bags, label them what they are and where to find recipe and put them in the fridge for the week. So when I get up in the morning I pull a mix out and have my coffee and then start it up. I use the dried egg substitute, dried milk, etc. So all I have to add is my water, oil (if that is fat used), honey or molasses( again if that is called for in recipe), and my yeast. I know these will work, as they are usually tried and true recipes. I find that this way when I have all ingredients out, it is more efficient to measure up mix after mix, also less clean up.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  raisins
  8             ounces  currants
  8             ounces  sultanas
  1       4 ounces who  candied peel -- 1/4-inch dice
  8             ounces  Demerara sugar
  10      fluid ounces  hot tea ( Earl Grey, Lapsang Souchong) -- or

  4             ounces  pecans (I used walnuts)
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1              pound  self raising flour

Line 2 x 1 lb loaf tins with baking paper.

The evening before, put the dried fruit and peel in a bowl with the sugar and pour the hot tea over it. Cover and leave overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 F / 170 C and toast the nuts for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch they don't burn. Roughly chop them when they are cool. Beat the egg with the milk and stir into the fruit mixture. Sift (I don't bother) in the flour and add the nuts and give everything a good stir. Divide between 2 loaf tins and bake for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until the centre is springy.
Loosen them with a knife straight away and turn out onto a wire rack to cool.

NOTES : This is a nice moist loaf with no added fat apart from what is in the nuts. It freezes well. I slice it first and reassemble the slices into a loaf, with the (used) baking paper zigzagging between the slices so that you can get them out one at a time. You can pop them in the toaster to defrost and butter them if you like.
I didn't have enough candied peel so I used crystallized ginger instead and I liked it that way.
Demerara sugar is a light brown free flowing quite crystalline sugar, but any brown sugar would be OK.

No cup measures for this one I'm afraid: It's basically 2 lb of fruit and
nuts.  10 fluid oz is 1 1/4 cups. I've made this recipe and I like it. The
basic recipe is from Delia Smith, but the instructions and comments are
phrased by me.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm water -- (105° to 115°)
  1               pkg.  active dry yeast
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  milk
  1               tsp.  sugar
  3 1/4           cups  warm water -- (105° to 115°)
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1              Tbsp.  snipped fresh rosemary
                        -- or 1 tsp. dried rosemary -- crushed
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2               tsp.  salt
  7               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (7 to 71/2)
                        Fresh rosemary sprigs -- (optional)
                        Olive oil -- (optional)

In a large mixing bowl stir together the 1 cup warm water and yeast. Let stand about 3 minutes or till mixture looks creamy. Stir in the 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup at a time, the milk,
and sugar. Cover and set in a warm place for 4 to 24 hours or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. With a freestanding electric mixer on low speed or by hand with a spoon, beat the 13/4 cups warm water, the 1/3 cup olive oil, rosemary, garlic, and salt into the yeast mixture. Beat in as much of the remaining flour as you can, 1 cup at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Rub the surface of the dough with a little flour and shape into a ball. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease surface. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place till double (2 to 3 hours). Punch the dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half. Shape into round loaves, -pulling the top surfaces tight and pinching any seams together under the loaves. Place on a large greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn- meal (or, on parchment paper, if using a bread stone). Cover and let rise till nearly double (about 1 hour). Preheat oven to 400° and adjust 2 oven racks so that one is in the lowest position and the other is in the middle of the oven. If using a bread stone, place it on the middle rack and preheat stone for 30 minutes. Rub loaves lightly with flour. With a sharp knife or clean razor blade, cut a crisscross design atop each loaf, about 1/4 inch deep. Brush rosemary sprigs with additional olive oil, if desired, and place on top of loaves. For a crisper crust, place a broiler pan on the bottom oven rack while the oven preheats. When pan is hot, carefully pour about 1 cup hot tap water into the pan in the oven. Be careful of the hot steam. Leave bread on baking sheet or carefully transfer with parchment paper directly to the preheated bread stone; place in the oven on the middle rack. (If you don't have room to bake both loaves at once, place loaf, covered, in the refrigerator, removing 15 minutes before baking time.

Repeat heating broiler pan and adding water for second loaf.) Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or till loaves are deep golden brown and crusty. The water in the pan will evaporate after about 10 minutes of baking time; remove the dry pan to avoid warping. Transfer loaves to wire racks; cool. Makes 2 loaves (16 slices a loaf).

  1 1/2           cups  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1            package  dry yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  4          teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  Rye Sourdough Starter measured after sti -- See recipe
  2               cups  gluten flour
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- or as needed
                        Cornmeal -- for sprinkling
                        GLAZE
  1                     egg white -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water
                        OPTIONAL TOPPING
  2          teaspoons  Black Caraway seeds (chernushka)

Combine 1/2 cup of the warm water, the yeast and sugar and let stand until double in bulk.

Dissolve the salt in the remaining warm water in a mixing bowl. Mix in the sourdough starter, then the yeast mixture, then the gluten flour and 2 cups of the all-purpose flour, make a soft dough.

Spread 1 1/2 cups flour on a kneading surface and turn the dough out on to it. Knead adding more flour if necessary to make a soft dough that will hold its shape. Do not over-kneed. The dough should be only slightly elastic, ever a bit sticky.

Form the dough into a ball and put it in an ungreased bowl; cover with plastic, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it a few strokes to expel the air. Cover with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes.

Divide the dough in half. Form each half into a loaf by flattening it to an inch-thick oval about 12 inches long, then rolling it up from one long side. Pinch the seam closed. Shape ends of the oval loaves neatly and place them on two cornmeal-dusted baking sheets, seam side down. Cover with towels and let rise until "three-quarters proofed," or not fully doubled.

While the loaves are rising, set a large roasting pan containing 2 inches of boiling water on the oven floor (or the lowest shelf of an electric oven) and preheat the oven to 400F.

Brush the loaves with egg-white glaze, being careful not to let the glaze drip onto the pan, as it sticks and burns. With a single-edged razor blade or a small, sharp knife, cut three diagonal slashes, holding the blade almost parallel to the surface about 1/4 inch deep on each loaf. Sprinkle the loaves with "black caraway" or caraway seeds, if you like.

Bake for 30 minutes on the middle and upper shelves of the oven, then brush again with the glaze, exchange shelf positions, and remove the water pan. Bake for 20 or 30 minutes longer, or until there is a hollow sound when you rap the bottom of the loaf.

Cool the bread on racks.

To Audrey Konie who asked for a real Jewish Rye...here's one I've used for a long time. As transplanted East Coasters it reminded us of home. A word of warning, however, store it in a brown paper bag, not plastic, and the crust will stay crisp. The starter takes a couple of days to "work", but I made up a jar of it for my 'fridge and just feed it until I want to bake the bread again.

  1                cup  warm milk
  4                     eggs -- at room temperature
  1              stick  butter or margarine
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  1 1/2           Tbsp  cinnamon
  7               cups  KA Unbleached A-P Flour -- (7 to 9)
  12                    dyed uncooked eggs
                        Egg wash:
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1               Tbsp  water -- and
  1              pinch  salt -- to help liquefy the
                        egg
                        ---
                        Icing Glaze
  1 1/2           cups  confectioners' sugar
  3               Tbsp  orange liqueur

Dissolve the yeast in the water. Stir in the sugar and add 1/2 cup flour. Let this sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to get going. Add the milk, eggs, butter, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in 4 cups of the flour. Add more flour, until the dough starts to form a shaggy mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead it, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough has formed a smooth and satiny ball. The dough will be a little tacky, but it shouldn't be sticky.

Put the dough into a clean bowl and coat it with a little melted butter. This will help prevent the formation of a skin on the dough due to exposure to the air. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel.

Let the dough rise in a warm spot for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until it's quite swollen and puffy- looking. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead it gently to expel any air bubbles. You don't need to actively knead the dough at this point; that will excite the gluten in the dough and make it harder to braid the bread.

Divide the dough into 2 pieces and set one aside. Divide the first piece into 3 even pieces. Roll each piece into a rope that is 1-inch in diameter. Braid the set of ropes and shape the braid into a large circle. Place the circle on a greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the second piece of dough.

Cover the loaves with damp towels and let the wreaths rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Place the eggs on the wreaths and gently press them into the dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Bake the loaves for 35 to 45 minutes, until nicely browned. Occasionally, an egg will split in the oven. Use a sharp knife to remove it from the wreath and
substitute a dyed hard-boiled egg. Cool the wreaths on a rack and ice when fully cool. Makes 2 wreaths, each yielding 12 large slices.


Icing Glaze
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 Tbsp orange liqueur

Beat the sugar and the liqueur together. The icing should be the consistency of a thick salad dressing. Use a fork to drizzle the icing on the wreaths.

  1              stick  butter -- at room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
                        Grated rind of 1 lemon -- *
  2                     eggs
  2 1/2           cups  flour
     1/2           tsp  salt
     3/4           tsp  baking soda
     1/3           cup  lemon juice -- *
     1/3           cup  water -- *
  1                cup  sourdough starter made with white flour
                        Confectioner's Icing made with lemon juice

* I used the rind and juice of 2 medium lemons. They yielded a little bit more than 1/3 cup of juice. I added enough water to end up with the required 2/3 cup liquid.

**I applied the icing after the loaf had fully cooled. Instead of melting into the loaf, the icing stayed solid while drizzling down the sides. This is just another option for flavor and presentation.

Preheat oven to 350F. Butter a 9 inch loaf pan. Cream the butter with the sugar and grated rind until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda. In a small bowl combine the lemon juice and water. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with the lemon mixture, beating until fluffy. Fold in the sourdough starter until batter is smooth. Pour into the loaf pan and bake 1 hour, or until bread tests done. Leave the bread in the pan and place on wire rack 10 minutes. Turn out and brush with the Confectioner's Icing while warm**. Quick bread is much easier to slice after it has cooled.

Confectioner's Icing: Combine 1 cup confectioner's sugar with 2 tsp lemon juice and enough water to make a creamy frosting.

NOTES : Last year I made a sourdough banana bread from "World Sourdoughs from Antiquity". To use sourdough starter in something sweet seemed intriguing. The result was a moist banana bread with a distinct "cheesecake-like" flavor. Yesterday while trying to find ways to use up some active starter, I made another sweet batter bread with the same complimentary cheesecake flavor as a result. Thought others might be interested in this use of starter since it is a quick and easy way to use starter and gives a different dimension to good, but sometimes ordinary quick breads. Here is the recipe I tried yesterday.

Preheat oven to 450 F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Mix flours and add water until you have a soft, kneadable dough. Knead about 5 minutes. Let dough rest a couple of minutes.

Break off egg-sized portions of dough. Stretch as thinly as you can before rolling into thin, oval slabs. Prick each slab with a fork or pastry docker.

Place on baking sheet and as soon as sheet is filled with matzohs, place in oven. Bake until crisp and buckled - about 3 minutes. Cool before serving.

NOTES : This matzoh is not in accordance with Passover law. 'Legal' Passover matzoh is made from wheat grown in special fields, processed by special mills and the dough must not rise for more than 18 minutes. More than 18 minutes would encourage natural fermentation. Thus, this version is not appropriate for a Passover seder. Still, it is rustic, historic and fun.

  2               Cups  flour -- *
  1                Cup  spring water -- (approximately)

*  (preferably freshly ground with the coarsest bran sifted out; either hard whole wheat flour or spelt flour)

You will need a medium sized bowl, a rolling pin, a fork, or a metal comb or other utensil for making holes in the breads, and quarry tiles to fit on the rack of the oven or one or two baking sheets.

Place tiles or baking sheets on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat oven to 425.

When the oven is hot place 2 cups flour in a medium sized bowl and stir in water until a kneadable dough forms; you may have to add a little more flour or water, depending on your flours. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead very quickly and vigorously until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes. (Although you are trying to get the dough into the oven quickly, the time spent kneading is important, as it makes the dough easier to roll out very thin.) Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces and flatten with lightly floured hands.

Work with one piece of dough at a time, keeping the others covered with plastic wrap. On a lightly floured surface roll out one piece of dough as thin as possible. Prick it all over with a fork or a sharp toothed comb, and then try to stretch it slightly to widen the holes you have made. Transfer to the quarry tiles or baking sheet, placing it to one side to leave room for more breads and bake for 2 and 1/2 to 3 minutes, until golden on the bottom and starting to crisp around the pricked holes.

Meanwhile, continue rolling out the dough, placing each bread in the oven as it is ready. If you are working with a partner, one should roll out the dough while the other pricks, stretches and bakes the breads. This will be much easier to get the breads baked in time. If your oven is small, you may not be able to fit in enough breads at once to get them done in time. If so, you can bake some of the breads on the your stove top in a dry skillet, to get them all started baking within the 18 minute time limit.

For a traditional crisp, dried matzoh, leave the breads out on a rack to cool completely and to dry.

With the small amount of dough this recipe makes, you can get all the breads into the oven if not completely baked) in less than eighteen minutes from when we first add water to the flour. the recipe assumes that you wish to make matzoh within the time limit; without a large commercial oven, and several helping hands for the rolling out, you must begin with a small amount of dough to get all the breads done in time. To make more, make the recipe again a second time. If you aren't worried about complying with the time limit, you can bake in larger batches.

Alternatives: If you prefer salted breads, stir in 1 teaspoon of salt into the flour, then add the water. You can add a little olive oil to the dough if you wish. Matzoh made with salt and oil is still matzoh, but not appropriate for a Passover seder (there is no need to rush these breads).

Makes 12 thin breads approximately 8" in diameter.

                        ****

One individual suggested using a small cinnamon roll (referring to any recipe you would use to make cinnamon rolls) and rolling it between waxed paper, then lightly painting it with melted butter or margarine, then sprinkling brown sugar and finely chopped pecans on it, then rolling it again on the waxed paper, transporting it onto a parchment paper and baking it. I baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. The dough ended up at about 1/16" thick before baking; after the baking they were nearly 1/8", and after cooled, crisp, crunchy and delicious. The brown sugar had been caramelized. I would imagine that the fact that it was baked on an AirBake pan prevented any burning. Anyway, I ended up with 22 of then, at approximately 8" diameter. I would strongly suggest that anyone who is diet-minded definitely not make them--------THEY'RE ADDICTIVE !!!

Add yeast to warm water. Add other ingredients and let dough rise. Work into biscuits and drop into hot fat.

This recipe will make about 7 dz. biscuits. They can be frozen individually and stored in plastic bags. When you work them up, don't let the biscuits rise too high. The fat should be slightly hotter than 350 degrees F. If fat should be too hot, the biscuits will be soggy in the center.

Now allow plenty for each person, as these are goooood. Especially warm with warm apple butter.
They served with a sourish cole slaw to act as a foil for the sweet biscuits and apple butter. Left overs are good for breakfast, heated in microwave a few seconds.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk -- heated to hot
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4        tablespoons  (1/2 stick) unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1           envelope  active dry yeast  (not fast-acting)
     1/4           cup  warm (100 to 105) water
  1              large  egg
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (3 1/2 to 4)
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter

1. In a medium mixing bowl, pour the milk over 1/4 cup of the sugar, the
softened butter, and the salt. Stir to melt the butter. Let cool to warm.
2. Meanwhile, in a small measuring cup, mix the yeast with the warm water and
the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
3. When the milk mixture has cooled to warm, add the yeast mixture, the egg,
and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Beat well with a wooden spoon to form a satiny
smooth batter. Add enough of the remaining 1 to 1 1/2 cups flour to make a
somewhat sticky dough that leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out on a
lightly floured surface and knead lightly until smooth and elastic, letting
the dough pick up only enough flour to prevent sticking.
4. Place the dough in a buttered bowl, and turn once to butter the top. Cover
with plastic wrap and let stand until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
5. Punch down the dough; divide into 3 parts. Working with 1 part at a time,
roll out to a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Spread with 1/3 of
the melted butter. Cut, as for pie, into 8 equal wedges. Roll each wedge from
the wide end to the point and place, point-side down, on a nonstick or
greased baking sheet. Curve the ends slightly to form a crescent shape. Cover
with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
6. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375F.
7. Bake the rolls in the oven until evenly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve
hot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water  (about 110 degrees)
  1                cup  plus 2 tablespoons warm milk  (about 110
                        degrees)
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  honey or molasses
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  quick-cooking or regular rolled oats
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Melted butter or margarine

1. Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large bowl; stir briefly. Let stand
until foamy (about 5 minutes).
2. Add milk, butter, honey, salt, cinnamon, oats, and egg; stir until mixture
is blended. Stir in 2 cups of the flour.
3. Add remaining 1 cup flour. Beat vigorously with a heavy spoon until dough
pulls away from sides of bowl but is still soft and sticky.
4. Turn batter into a well-greased coffee can (26 oz. size). Cover with
well-greased plastic lid. (At this point, you may freeze for up to 2 weeks.
5. Let rise in a warm place until batter pushes off lid (1 to 1 1/2 hours; 6
to 8 hours if frozen).
6. Bake in can, uncovered, on lowest rack of a 350 degree oven until crust is
well browned (about 50 minutes). Lightly brush crust with butter. Let cool in
can on rack for 5 minutes; turn out onto rack and let cool upright.

NOTES:
     BATTER BREAD is made from very soft yeast dough, almost like a batter,
as the name indicates. Vigorous beating takes the place of kneading and the
bread rises only once. The loaf is baked in an ordinary coffee can (26 oz.
size). The can offers support for the soft dough during rising and also gives
the bread its distinctive shape--tall, round, and domed.
     Be sure your coffee can still has its plastic lid; it's useful at two
different stages. First, it seals the batter in the can for freezing if you
want to prepare the dough ahead of time and bake the bread later. Second, the
lid tells you when the dough is ready to bake--it pops off!  If the lid comes
off before the dough reaches the can rim, don't worry; simply replace the lid
and wait until the dough pushes it off.

  1         tablespoon  milk

This is the recipe for Old Milwaukee Rye Bread from "New Complete Book of Breads" by Bernard Clayton, Jr. Someone asked that I post it. I include the introductory paragraph because I find it interesting.

Old Milwaukee Rye bread has become a delicious classic in my kitchen. It was one of the first loaves of bread to come from my oven when I started baking, and it had been a favorite ever since. Over the years, it has become a classic (and a favorite) in other kitchens as well.

"It begins with a sponge (or sour) rising and falling in a bowl under a taut plastic wrap that will bubble to its maximum goodness in about three days, give or take a few hours. After a day or so, a whiff of the fermented sponge will make manifest the historic relationship between the baker and the brewer.

"I have baked hundreds of loaves of Old Milwaukee Rye, and each time I have done so, I have had a warm thought for Bernadine Landsberg of Milwaukee, who sent me the recipe a long time ago.

"The dough can be fashioned into 2 large round loaves - good for husky sandwiches - or 3 or 4 long slender loaves, ideal for slicing thin to serve at a buffet or brunch.

"Note: this is a large amount of heavy dough for food processors. I suggest doing just half of the recipe for that method."


Baking sheet
1 baking sheet greased, Teflon, or sprinkled with cornmeal, or 2 baguette pans, greased.
(note from PAT: I use 2 hearth rye bread pans from King Arthur.)

Preparation: 1 - 3 days
To make the sponge, in a large bowl, measure the rye flour, yeast, seeds, and water. Blend well with 25 strokes of a wood spoon. Cover the bowl snuggly with plastic wrap so the sponge loses none of its moisture, which will condense on the plastic and fall back into the mixture. The dark brown pastelike batter will rise and fall as it develops flavor and a delicious aroma. Stir once each day.
(Note from PAT: although I have made this several times, the sponge has never been dark brown. Both at this point and with the finished loaves, I get light to medium brown.)

The sponge, which will resemble a wet mash that's too thick to pour and too thin to knead, may be used anytime after 6 hours although the longer the better - up to 3 days, when it will have ceased fermentation. If it fails to bubble up after falling back anytime during the 3-day period, don't think it is dead. It's not. It's just resting but gaining flavor all the time.

By hand or mixer 20 minutes
To make the dough, on bake day, uncover the bowl and add the water, molasses, 1 tablespoon caraway seed, salt, rye flour, and about 2 cups white flour. Beat until smooth, about 100 strokes or 3 minutes with the mixer flat beater. Add the shortening.

Stir in the balance of the white flour, 1/2 cup at a time, first with the spoon and they by hand or with the mixer dough hook. The dough should clean the sides of the bowl but it will be somewhat sticky, thanks to the perverse nature of rye flour.

Kneading 8 minutes.
Turn the dough out into a floured work surface and knead by hand (with the help of a dough blade) or under the mixer dough hook. If by hand, knead with a strong push-turn-fold rhythm until the dough is smooth. Add sprinkles of white flour if necessary to control stickiness.

By processor 5 minutes
Prepare the sponge, as above.

Attach the plastic blade. Reduce this size of this recipe because the dough is do heavy.

Pour the sponge into the processor work bowl and add the hot water, molasses, 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, salt. Pulse to blend into a light batter like dough. Add all of the rye flour. Pulse. Add the shortening.

With the machine on, measure in the white flour, 1/4 cup at a time. Add the last portion with care - no more than necessary to create a ball of dough that will ride the blade around the work bowl, cleaning it as it whirls.

Kneading 45 seconds.
Leave the machine running and knead for 45 seconds.

The dough will be some what sticky when it comes from the work bowl but a few sprinkles of white flour will make it easy to shape into a ball.

First Rising 1 hour
Place the dough in a greased bowl and place plastic wrap over the top of the bowl. Leave at room temperature until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

(If prepared with a new fast-rising yeast at the recommended higher temperatures, reduce the rising times by half.)

Punch down 10 minutes
Punch down and let rise for an additional 10 minutes.

Shaping 6 minutes
Divide the dough. For 2 round loaves, mold each into a smooth ball and place on the baking sheet. Flatten the tops slightly. For a long slender loaf, roll the piece under the fingers and palms so that it stretches lengthwise to become a baton, a French word that graphically describes the shape. Place the pieces side by side on the baking sheet or in the special twin pans made primarily for French baguettes.

Second rising 40 minutes.
Cover the loaves with wax paper. Leave until loaves have doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes.

Preheat.
Preheat the oven to 375F 20 minutes before baking.

Baking 375F 40 minutes.
Rye loaves should have the traditional design cut with a sharp knife or razor blade. Carefully slash 3 or 4 diagonal cuts across the top of each long loaf. For the found loaves, cut a tic-tac-toe design or 3 or 4 parallel cuts across the top of the loaves.

Brush the tops with the egg-milk wash for a shiny crust (or water for an unglazed one). Sprinkle the moist glaze with 1 tablespoon caraway seeds (which will stick better on the egg glaze).

Bake the loaves for about 40 minutes or until they test done - tapping the bottom crust yields a hard hollow sound. The loaves will be dark brown, almost blank. If the loaves appear to be browning too quickly, cover with a piece of foil or sack paper.

(if using a convection over, reduce heat by 40F.)

Final step
Removed from the oven and allow to cool on metal racks.

This bread keeps for at least a week or more in a plastic bag, and freezes for months at 0F.

  2        tablespoons  Cointreau -- or orange juice
  1 1/4           cups  powdered sugar

Butter two 9" diameter cake pans.

Combine milk, 1/4 cup orange juice & 4 T. butter in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until mixture registers 120F on thermometer. Whisk eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, orange peel & salt in large bowl. Gradually whisk in heated milk mixture. Add yeast, then flour, mixing until dough is moist. Knead dough on floured work surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

Place dough in lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

Punch down dough and divide in half. Roll 1 piece on floured work surface into 12 x 18" rectangle. Spread with 3 t. butter; sprinkle evenly with 1/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup sugar. Roll up from 1 long side; pinch log at seam to seal. Slice log into 12 rolls; place rolls, cut side down & side by side, in single layer in one prepared pan. Repeat with remaining dough, butter, chocolate chips & sugar. Cover rolls loosely; let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375F. Stir cream and Cointreau together; drizzle evenly over rolls. Bake until rolls are puffed and golden, about 25 minutes.
 Cool 15 minutes. (Can also be made 1 day ahead; cool completely in pans. Cover & store at room temperature...rewarm in 350F oven until heated through, about 10 minutes. I have also frozen these, wrapped securely in zipper freezer bags, they came through fine.)

Whisk powdered sugar with enough orange juice to make a thick glaze, adding 1 T. juice at a time. Remove rolls from pan; spread with glaze. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  milk
     1/3           cup  molasses -- (see note)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2           packages  dry yeast
  4               cups  bread or all-purpose flour -- (approximately)
  1                     egg
  2               cups  cooked and cooled rice
     1/2           cup  currants

Note: There is a choice between unsulphured molasses (Plantation, Golden Harvest, etc.) which has a distinct and assertive flavor, or a milk molasses such as Br'er Rabbit, either light or dark.

Baking pans: 2 medium (8" X 4") loaf pans, greased or Teflon.

Two mixing and kneading directions are given: (1) by hand or mixer, and (2) by processor.

By hand or mixer, 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan, warm the milk, molasses, butter, and salt. In a separate bowl, sprinkle the yeast over 2 cups flour and stir to blend. Pour in the milk mixture and beat 100 strokes with a spoon, or for 2 minutes with the mixer flat beater. While beating, add the egg, rice, and currants.

Kneading, 8-10 minutes. Add the remaining flour, a little at a time, until the dough forms a solid mass and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes by hand, or 8 minutes under a dough hook. The dough will be quite sticky as you begin but will become elastic and smooth as sprinkles of flour are added. Refrain from using too much flour. Keep the dough elastic and not a hard ball.

By processor, 2 minutes. Attach the plastic dough blade. Add the milk, molasses, butter, salt, and yeast to the work bowl. Pulse once to mix. Add 2 cups flour. Pulse. Add the egg and then the rice and currants. Pulse to blend. Add the flour through the work tube, with the processor on, 1/2 cup at a time.

Kneading, 45 seconds. When the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and forms a ball riding on top of the blade, process for 45 seconds to knead.

First rising. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and put aside at room temperature to double in volume, about 1 hour.

Shaping, 15 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Cut the dough into two pieces. Form rectangular loaves, the length of the pans. Place the dough in the pans and press down with your fingers to push the dough into the corners and level.

Second rising, 45 minutes. Cover the loaves with waxed or parchment paper and leave to rise at room temperature until the dough reaches 1 inch above the edge of the pans, about 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400F, 20 minutes before baking.

Baking, 400F, 35 minutes. A design cut in the top of the loaves will make them more appealing. Cut with a razor blade the length of the loaf, or make 4 or 5 diagonal cuts. Place the loaves on the middle or lower shelf of the oven and bake for 35 minutes, or until the loaves test done when tapped on the bottom with a forefinger.

Final step. Turn out from the pans onto a metal rack to cool. The bread's dark deliciousness may surprise you when sliced.

NOTES : Pain au Riz is a brown loaf, thanks to molasses, and speckled throughout with cooked grains of rice and black currants. It is a delicious, different kind of bread that is great for sandwiches, toasted for breakfast, and for snacks in between. It is a French creation, one of Cecile Chemin's, a fine cookbook author.

* (the recipe states you can double the sugar for a sweeter dough, but IMHO 1/4 cup  is just fine)
** (you can peel them if the skins are really thick or you're allergic to the fuzz)

(makes 2 breads)

mix the milk, sugar, salt and yeast, stirring until the yeast is dissolved. Stir in the egg and butter. Add half of the flour and mix well. Add the remaining flour and mix until dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until blistered (their term - I knead it for about 5 minutes or so). Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat. cover with a damp
cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down, let rise again until almost double, about 45 minutes. Divide dough in half and press into 2 greased 8 inch square cake pans. Arrange the sliced peaches, overlapping one another in straight rows. To keep the peaches from turning black, sprinkle with lemon or orange juice. Sprinkle this with the mixture of cinnamon and confectioners sugar. cover and let rise until double in bulk, about 30 minutes.
Bake in a 400 degree oven for about 25-30 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar (a favorite in Baltimore) or add the glaze as soon as it is taken from the oven.

I keep what's leftover (which usually isn't much) in the fridge to keep the peaches from spoiling...

NOTES : this recipe is called "peach bread" and in the Baltimore area, this is also sold as "peach bread" - it sort of qualifies as bread in the sense you make yeast dough up for it....no matter what you want to call it, it's good, IMHO..it's from a newspaper that has long since gone down the tubes (yes, the same one the strawberry bread recipe came from) and there's no author....

                Hand Made                       Vegetable & Herb Breads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  russet potato -- peeled and grated
  3               cups  cold water
     1/4           cup  plus 1 teaspoon solid vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           envelope  active dry yeast  (not fast-acting)
     1/2           cup  warm (100 to 105) water
  8               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (8 to 9)

1. Place the grated potato and the 3 cups water in a medium saucepan; bring
to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the potato
pieces are very soft and begin to break apart, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from
the heat.
2. Stir in 1/4 cup of the shortening, the sugar, and the salt. Let cool to
lukewarm.
3. In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water. When the potato
mixture has cooled, add it to the yeast mixture. Add 4 cups of the flour and
beat well with a wooden spoon. Gradually add enough of the remaining flour (4
to 5 cups) to make a soft dough. Turn out on a lightly floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Rinse the bowl with warm water; dry the bowl. Grease the bowl with the
remaining 1 teaspoon shortening. Place the ball of dough in the bowl, and
turn the dough to grease the top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
hour.
5. Punch down the dough. Divide into 3 parts. Shape each part into a ball and
place in well-greased round pans, such as pie tins. Cover and let rise until
doubled, about 45 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400F.
7. Sift a light dusting of flour over the risen loaves. Bake in the oven
until they are browned on top and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 30
to 35 minutes. Cool on wire racks.

NOTE: Many recipes for potato bread start with mashed potatoes, but this
calls for a boiled grated potato--more convenient if you don't serve mashed
potatoes that often. The bread is delicious.

-Always use a fairly high heat i.e. 400-450 degrees for a crisp crust. Professional pizza ovens use even higher heat.

-A "pizza stone" preheated helps crisp the crust, but is not essential.

-For a "Sicilian" or thick crust pizza simply allow your rolled or stretched out dough to rise a bit before topping. I usually bake it in a pan. Your pizza will be less dense and chewy than the thinner type.

-This trick comes from "Secrets of A Jewish Baker". Place all your toppings except for the cheese on the dough. Place in preheated oven. Bake pizza until the edges of dough start to brown. You can probably allow it to bake about 10 minutes before checking. My oven has a window and light so fortunately I don't have to open the oven and thus lose heat when checking. Once the edges have started browning. Remove pizza and top with cheese. Replace in oven and continue to bake until cheese is melted. This avoids underbaked dough, allows toppings (especially raw veggies) to partially cook and eliminates overbrowned cheese. My family thinks that pizza baked in this manner is superior to the usual "put everything on top at once" and bake.

                        *****

I've had so many great pizza's over the years that I'm reluctant to say one recipe is the best, but I can say this: there is one way to improve practically every pizza dough recipe, and that is to use the same trick most good pizza parlors use--retard the dough overnight before using it. Follow your favorite recipe and, after thirty minutes into the first rise--don't worry if it hasn't increased in size-- divide the dough into the desired size balls, rub each ball lightly with olive or vegetable oil, place on a sheet pan (I cover my pan with baking parchment to protect against an oxidation reaction between the dough and the metal, but this is more likely to happen with old pans that have lost their glaze), place the sheet pan into a plastic trash bag, seal the bag and place in the fridge overnight (you can actually keep these up to three days in the fridge). When ready to make the pizzas the dough will be very relaxed and easy to roll out or toss but, more importantly, the flavor will be dramatically improved due to the enzymatic release of natural sugars from the starch. If you handle the dough gently you will also get a great puff around the edges of your pizza, just as the pizza parlors do.

I'd love to hear from anyone who tries this technique to find out if you agree that it noticeably improves your pizza dough.

Happy pizza pie-ing!
Peter Reinhart

PS This technique also dramatically improves focaccia. Press the dough into the oiled pan on the first day and then retard. Proof and bake on the second day. You'll be amazed at the difference!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  1                cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  powdered milk
  1            package  yeast
                        ---
  2               cups  warm water
  3               cups  bread flour
                        ---
                        flour
                        salt

The procedure is to make a starter three days ahead by mixing one cup of whole wheat flour, one cup of warm water, one tablespoon of powdered milk, and one packet of yeast. This is allowed to sit, covered in a warm place for 24 hours. Then two cups of warm water and three cups of regular or bread flour are mixed in and this is allowed to sit for 24 hours. The final day you add the final flour and salt to make the bread.

I would think this approach could work for a lot of bread making to make it more in the sourdough style. I have found surprisingly different tastes by using different company's whole wheat flour. My favorite is Gold Medal. I have varied this recipe by using honey instead of powdered milk for a friend with severe lactose intolerance. I even, on occasion, added some rye flour at different stages, both for variation and to come closer to the actual bread made by Poilane, who has his own special wheat raised for his bread.

to simple let the dough rise twice >>

Here is how this old sourdough prepares his starter. I take it out of the refrigerator and place it in the oven with the light on for two hours. Then I feed it and let it sit in the oven for another four or five hours. By now, it is really bubbling. Next, I remove the required amount for whatever recipe I am using and mix it with the rest of the ingredients. The starter goes back into the refrigerator until the next time.

By the way, my mixed and kneaded dough then sits on the kitchen counter overnight. It is ready to roll in the morning. I have really good luck with my starter and my wife says that the only thing missing from my San Francisco sourdough bread are the cable cars. [TheGuamTarheels@webtv.net]

I know a lot of books say to take your starter out of the fridge and let it warm up to room temperature, then feed it and let it percolate for several hours. I simply feed it the minute I take it out of the fridge and let it percolate until it's bubbly. I can't see that the step of letting it come up to room temp before adding more flour and water makes a bit of difference, so I don't bother. Room temperature starter might get bubbly faster than chilled starter, but not enough faster to make up for the time spent waiting for the starter to come up to room temp! [CLRob99@aol.com]

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        *****

It is best to use flour that has a high gluten content... To be "puffy" the paste must be chilled, well-kneaded, and handled in such a way as to trap air and, finally, baked in a high, thoroughly preheated oven. then the air inside the dough expands with almost explosive effect. The surface on which you work -- preferably marble -- the tools, the ingredients and your fingers should be chilled throughout the operation, as it is necessary to hold the fat, which is in very high proportion to the flour, in constant suspension.

The paste must not absorb undue moisture, but it must never dry out. It must entirely envelop the butter. try not to let any cracks or tears develop, as they release the air which is your only riser. If they do appear, mend them at once to keep the butter encased. With these ideas firmly in mind, try making this small quantity first. As you become experienced, double or triple the recipe.

KNEAD: 1/4# sweet butter in ice water or under very cold running water. The butter should become soft through kneading, but in no sense soft through melting. Quite on the contrary--it must stay soft and chilled at the same time throughout the operation. The final kneading of the butter is best done on a marble slab; or the butter may be patted briskly in the hands until no water flies. Shape it into an oblong, about 4x6x3/4". Wrap in foil and chill for about 15 minutes.

MIX: 1/4 lb all purpose flour (must be weighed, NOT measured!) Make a ring on a chilled smooth surface with the flour, allowing about a 6" hollow center. Pour into the ring gradually -- meanwhile forming the flour into a ball with it -- a mixture of
2 to 2 1/2 oz. ice water
1 tsp. lemon juice
1/4 tsp. salt

Knead the dough lightly until smooth. The whole process should not take more than about 2 minutes (C: this is pretty much like making fresh pasta). Cover the dough carefully and refrigerate it for 15 minutes or so. When you remove the butter and dough from the refrigerator, they should be of about the same consistency -- chilled but not hard.

Roll the dough into a very neat oblong measuring about 6 x 16" and less than 1/3" thick. At this point, the dough is somewhat elastic and may have to be cajoled into the rectangle. Make the edges as even and thickness as constant as possible. Quickly place the chilled butter pad about 1" from a short end and the sides of the dough.

Fold the rest of the dough over the butter to make a pouch with one side folded and the three others sealed. Seal the two layers firmly on all three sides, pressing with the fingers or the sides of your hands.

With the narrow side toward you, roll the dough out evenly, being careful not to break the layers nor force the roller in such a way that the edges of the dough envelope become cracked. Should any opening develop, be sure to patch it at once with a small piece of dough taken from the long sides. Keep the pastry 6" in width while rolling and extend it to about 16" in length.

Now fold the pastry as if a business letter, into three equal parts overlapped. Make sure that the corners match neatly. Compress it slightly with the rolling pin. At this point, the dough should have a transparent quality. The yellow of the butter should show through, but not break through anywhere. Wrap the dough, now approximately 4x6x1", in foil and chill for 30 minutes. You have now made your first "turn" and, if you need a reminder, you can professionally make one shallow finger tip imprint in one corner before refrigerating. You can keep track of your turns by increasing the finger prints after each rolling.

After the dough has chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and repeat the rolling. Always roll with the narrow dimension of the dough toward you as you work. Roll as before until the dough again measures about 6x16". Fold once more in three equal parts. Make two finger tip impressions before refrigerating, covered, for 30 minutes. Repeat the turns until you have six prints in the dough. You may store the dough for 24 hours before baking; wrap it first in foil and then in a dry towel. Refrigerate it.

If baking the same day, rest the dough (refrigerated) after the 6th turn for 30-90 minutes.

For Palm Leaves (Elephant Ears): roll out to 6x18" and cut a very thin strip off of each edge to leave the layers free. Cover the center half liberally with sugar (and spices if you like ... cinnamon, allspice, a little cloves, coriander?? Also, finely ground nuts are a fine addition.) ... coarse sugar is best. Fold the two ends into the middle; cover the center half liberally with the sugar (and spice(s) and/or nuts) again, and again fold the ends into the middle. You now have a fat, squat package.

Sometime earlier, you've prepared pans by sprinkling lightly with cold water, and you have PREHEATED THE OVEN thoroughly to 500F for at least 20 minutes.

Using a VERY SHARP, SERRATED bread knife (wave-like or pointy serrations, not a ham-slicer style knife), or a pizza cutter if yours is large enough to cut the height, cut 1/2" slices from the folded edge to the open (two-folded-edges) side. Place cut-side-down on the prepared pans, now you can see the double-spiral pattern.

Bake 25-30 minutes, until it feels very light when lifted. Cool on wire rack. Makes about 20.

This is Carolyn: the instructions sound totally overwhelming; however, if you read them through a couple of times, you'll find it's not as horrifying as it seems. And the pleasure of nibbling genuine puff pastry, very fresh, is WELL worth the effort!

Select Basic white cycle. Use medium or light colour crust and do not use delay cycles. Place all ingredient in the bread maker in the order listed except the Garlic. Add the mashed garlic at the raisin nut signal or 5 to 10 minutes before last kneading cycle ends. To Prepare Roasted Garlic: Heat oven to 350 and peel away paper like skin from around the garlic bulbs leaving just enough to hold bulb intact. Trim tops of garlic bulbs about 1/2 inch to expose cloves. Place bulbs stem ends down on 12 inch square of foil. Drizzle each bulb with 2 ts olive or vegetable oil. Wrap securely in foil and place in pie plate or shallow baking pan. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until garlic is tender when pierced with toothpick or fork. Cool slightly. Gently squeeze garlic out of cloves. A one ounce bulb of garlic roasted equals about 1 tablespoon mashed garlic. A 2 ounce bulb equals about 2 tablespoons mashed garlic.

Other than that, they serve a lot of quick breads in the Caribbean: banana bread, avocado bread.
To make avocado bread, get a buttermilk banana-bread and substitute avocado.
You might also want to use the traditional spices: nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, etc..

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry yeast
  3               cups  tepid water -- (80F)
  3 1/2           cups  medium rye flour
  1              small  onion -- peeled and halved

Dissolve the yeast in 2 cups tepid water, beat in 2 cups of the rye flour, beating until no lumps remain. Add the onion, cover loosely with a cloth, and let stand at room temperature for 24 hours.

Remove the onion . Beat in 1 cup tepid water, then 1 1/2 cups rye flour. Cover with a cloth and let stand for 24 hours longer. The starter should now be pleasantly sour-smelling, almost beery, and bubbly. (Depending on the room temperature, this result may take a slightly longer or shorter time.)


TO USE: The starter is now ready for use and can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use, without further feeding. If you must hold it longer, the night before it is wanted add 1/2 cup tepid water and 3/4 cup rye flour and let stand at room temperature overnight,

To Feed Leftover Starter: which should be done every 2 weeks or so- add a little rye flour and water, using 3 parts of flour to 2 of water. To build up a small amount into a large enough quantity for baking, do the job in several steps, never adding a larger amount of flour than the amount of starter on hand. Let the starter stand at room temperature overnight or for up to 24 hours. To increase further, add more flour and water in the same proportions and let it ferment until it is bubbly enough to use. Store leftover starter in the refrigerator between bakings and "feedings," and for indefinite storage freeze it. Thaw, then feed the starter and let it ferment at room temperature until it is again bubbly enough to use.

  2 1/2           cups  warm water (about 110) -- divided
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  7        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  dried whole sage leaves -- crumbled
  7 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- divided
  1              large  egg -- optional

Lightly grease a flat cookie sheet and dust with cornmeal. Set aside.

Put 1/2 cup warm water in a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over the top of the
water and stir to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine sugar, salt and oil. Stir in sage and the remaining
2 cups water. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the yeast mixture, then stir in 7
cups of flour, adding about 1 cup at a time. Let stand 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, dough should be stiff enough not to stick to your fingers
when formed into a ball. If needed, stir in remaining 1/2 cup flour.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 4 minutes,
until dough is smooth, elastic and satiny. Place dough ball in a greased
bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover bowl with a clean towel and set aside
in a warm place about 1 hour, until dough has doubled. Punch down dough and
remove from bowl.

Cut dough into three equal pieces and shape each into a 10-inch strip. Lay
the strips side by side about 1/2 inch apart, on the cookie sheet. Crimp
strips together at top and braid. Tuck ends under. If desired, beat egg with
1 tablespoon water and paint top of bread. Cover bread with the towel and let
rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350. Bake bread for 40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when
lightly tapped on the bottom.

  1         Tablespoon  honey or molasses
     2/3           cup  water
                        ---
                        To Finish the Pizza
  2               cups  chunky salsa
  1                cup  shredded Cheddar
                        -- Monterey Jack
                        -- and/or Mozzarella Cheese

*   (can be made from scratch, come from a can or be reconstituted from a mix)

Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for Dough or Manual, and press Start. The dough will be quite moist but should form a discrete ball. At the end of the final cycle, punch down the dough and place it on a lightly floured work surface to rest for five minutes.

If you do not have a bread machine, mix all ingredients by hand, and stir or knead until it forms a smooth ball. You will need to oil the surface where you knead the dough, and knead for at least 10 minutes. Try not to add more flour than listed above; dough will be moist. Let rise in an oiled bowl for 1-2 hours. Punch down the dough, and let rest for five minutes.

To Finish the Pizza

2 cups chunky salsa
1 cup shredded Cheddar, Monterey Jack, and/or Mozzarella Cheese

Preheat over to 475F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to either a 17 x 11 inch rectangle, or a 14" round. If you have a jelly roll pan that has slightly different dimensions, roll the dough to fit it. Lightly oil (or use Pam) the pan and place the dough into the pan, stretching it with your hands so that it covers the surface up to the edges,

Spread the dough with the salsa, leaving a 1 inch border, and sprinkle with the cheese. Place the pizza in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes, then bake it for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is deep brown and the cheese is bubbling. Serve hot.

NOTES : Our absolute favorite pizza recipe is from Lora Brody's "Pizza, Focaccia, Flat, and Filled Breads". My kids love it (although they're young and usually like it better with just cheese or with traditional tomato sauce and cheese). When I make it for friends they always ask for the recipe. Lora's recipe has all white flour; I make it with half white bread machine flour and half white wheat flour.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/3           cup  warm water  (about 110 degrees)
  1                cup  plus 2 tablespoons milk
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salad oil
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1               Dash  ground ginger
  3 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
                        Melted butter or margarine

1. Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large bowl; let stand until foamy
(about 5 minutes). Add milk, oil, sugar, salt, and ginger; stir until
blended. Stir in 2 3/4 cups of the flour.
2. Add remaining 1 cup flour. Beat vigorously with a heavy spoon until dough
pulls away from sides of bowl but is still soft and sticky.
3. Turn batter into well-greased coffee can (26 oz. size). Cover with
well-greased plastic lid. (At this point, you may freeze for up to 2 weeks.)
4. Let rise in a warm place until batter pushes off lid (1 to 1 1/2 hours; 6
to 8 hours if frozen).
5. Bake in can, uncovered, on lowest rack of a 350 degree oven until crust is
well browned (about 50 minutes). Lightly brush crust with butter. Let cool in
can on a rack for 5 minutes; turn out onto rack and let cool upright.

NOTES:
     BATTER BREAD is made from very soft yeast dough, almost like a batter,
as the name indicates. Vigorous beating takes the place of kneading and the
bread rises only once. The loaf is baked in an ordinary coffee can (26 oz.
size). The can offers support for the soft dough during rising and also gives
the bread its distinctive shape--tall, round, and domed.
     Be sure your coffee can still has its plastic lid; it's useful at two
different stages. First, it seals the batter in the can for freezing if you
want to prepare the dough ahead of time and bake the bread later. Second, the
lid tells you when the dough is ready to bake--it pops off!  If the lid comes
off before the dough reaches the can rim, don't worry; simply replace the lid
and wait until the dough pushes it off.

Yield:
  "1 Loaf"

  1 1/8             c.  water

  1                 t.  salt
     1/2            t.  yeast

Mix and knead until smooth, or put into the bread machine and let the machine do the work.

When using the sourdough starter, I just substitute the starter for liquid/flour at the same ratio, as my starter is made with a 1:1 water:flour ratio. For example, if I use 1 c. starter, I reduce the flour and water by 1/2 c. each. I also just watch it as I knead it by hand or mix it in my bread machine. What I've discovered is that no matter how much flour I add, it always gets sticky when I'm using sourdough starter, even though it doesn't get sticky when I just make plain french bread with flour and water.

The refrigeration makes the sticky dough manageable. I let my dough rise in the refrigerator before shaping. That cold dough is so easy to handle!! And then I let the shaped dough rise all day at room temperature. Wonderful flavor. Easy handling. Big air pockets. What more could a baker want?

baking pans
2 large (9" x5") baking pans. greased or Teflon

only 1 1/2 cups of sponge is used in this recipe. You can refrigerate the rest for later use...since I already have the sponge, I use the 1 1/2 cups for it

Preparation (4 or 5 days)
to make the sponge, in a medium bowl blend the yeast, flour, salt and sugar & add the of water. Stir for 30 seconds. Cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture and place in a warm spot (80-85 degrees). Stir down the sponge each day

On baking day, make the dough in a large mixing or mixer bowl. Measure 1 cup flour and stir in the sugar, salt, yeast, dry milk and hot water. Add the shortening and 1 & 1/2 cups of sponge. Beat for 3 minutes with the mixer flat beater at medium-high speed or for an equal length of time with a wooden spoon/

Stop the mixer and attach the dough hook. Stir in the balance of flour. 1/2 cup at a time until the dough is a rough shaggy mass that will clean the sides of the bowl. Or mix in by hand. If the dough continues to be moist and sticky, sprinkle with flour. The dough will form a soft ball around the hook and clean the sides of the bowl.


If by hand, turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface & knead with the rhytmic motion of push-turn-fold. If using a mixer, knead under the dough hook.
EIther way, knead for 8 minutes.

If the dough should be sticky, sprinkle with small additions of flour. If by hand, occasionally break the kneading rhythm by raising the dough above the work surface & throwing it down hard against the table

Place the dough in a greased or butterless bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap & leave at room temperature until the dough ahs risen to about twice its size, about an hour.

Punch down the dough with the fingertips and knead for about 30 seconds to press out bubbles. Put the dough on the lightly floured surface and cut in half with a knife. Shape each half into a ball and let rest under a towel for 5 minutes.

Form each loaf by pressing a ball of dough into a flat oval, roughly the size of the baking pan. fold the oval in half, pinch seam tightly to seal. tuck under the ends and place in the pan, seam down.

cover the pans with a length of wax paper and leave until the loaves have double in size, 50 minutes. Ideally the top of the dough should have risen about 1 inch above the level of the pans.,

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees 20 minutes before baking

Bake the loaves until they are a golden brown and test done, about 30 minutes. turn the loaf out of its pan and tap the bottom crust with a forefinger. A hard, hollow sound means the bread is baked. If not, return to the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Midway during the baking and again near the end of it, shift the loaves so they are exposed equally to the temperature variations of the oven. If you wish a darker crust, remove the loaves from the pans during the final 10 minutes of baking.

Remove the bread from the oven. Turn from the pan & cool on a wire rack.

for a softer crust, brush the bread with melted butter while the bread is still hot.

*note: to me, a tablespoon of salt seems like a lot, but since I use my own
starter, this isn't an issue..

This is the absolute all time favorite at work.  If there were 2 coworkers coming late to a potluck and there was one piece left, they would fight over it if it was this bread. (no names mentioned, they know who they are.)

Because of the milk and eggs in the recipe it is not recommended that you use the delayed bake option.

Set the bread machine for Sweet Bread (8 for an Oster machine).  Add ingredients according to the recommendation of the machine.

When I first made this, I had no lemons, so I used orange peel.  I now use 1/2 t. lemon peel and 1/2 t. orange peel.

     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  molasses
  2                     eggs
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               tsp.  baking soda

     1/4          tsp.  ground cloves
     1/4          tsp.  salt

Pour stout into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Keep it at a steady boil for 3 or 4 minutes, until reduced to 1 1/4 cup. Remove from heat.

With an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add molasses and eggs and mix until well combined. Sift flour, soda, spices and salt together. Alternately add small amounts of flour mixture and warm stout to butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.

Spoon batter into a greased 8 X 8 inch pan (I use a 9 X 9 pan and bake it for a little less time, and it's fine) and bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, until top is firm and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Those of us who insist on "guilding the lily" can also add 1/2 cup of chopped crystallized ginger. It tends to sink to the bottom, but it's good.

NOTES : I wanted to say I tried these today & they were a big hit, my hubby loved them. He says I made them before, but I don't remember - I don't think I did cos I was a little afraid they wouldn't rise properly/etc & some of the recipes I had seen seemed too complex - but this one worked perfectly, they rose & browned nicely -
they seem very similar to a recipe I have for German puffy pancakes, it doesn't use any leavening & it gets baked in the oven, too... [Robin91783@aol.com]

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  5 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (5 1/2 to 6)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  3              large  eggs
  2               cups  shredded Swiss cheese
  2        tablespoons  prepared mustard
                        Melted butter or margarine

Combine first 3 ingredients in a small saucepan; heat until warm (120 to 130).
Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add liquid mixture to flour mixture, beating at high speed of an electric mixer. Beat 2 additional minutes at medium speed. Add eggs, cheese, and mustard, beating just until blended. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Cover and let rest 30 minutes. Punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough in half. Let dough rest 10 minutes. Shape each portion into a ball; place balls in 2 well-greased 1 1/2-quart round baking dishes, turning to grease tops.
Cover and let rise in a warm place (85), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.
Bake at 375 for 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. (Cover with aluminum foil the last 15 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning, if necessary.) Remove bread from dishes immediately; brush with melted butter. Let cool completely on wire racks.

                        *****

one of my favorite "unusual" pizzas is a taco pizza - I replace 1 cup of flour in my favorite pizza dough recipe with 1 cup of corn meal, for starters. I prepare the taco meat in my usual way (I use a mix for the seasoning, but I imagine some would prefer to do this themselves). I roll out the pizza dough & place it in the baking pan. I add the taco meat (you can add whatever toppings you may choose), top with shredded Monterey Jack cheese & bake at 450 degrees for about 12 minutes or until suitably brown for you. There is also a variation where I put the taco meat around the sides of the pizza & make small slashes in the middle of the pizza & fold the crust over the mixture - a sort of taco strudel;)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                 oz  Fresh yeast
                        -- or 2 pk Instant dry yeast granules
  1 1/4              c  Warm water -- (125F)
  2 1/4              c  Unbleached white flour
     1/4             c  Whole wheat flour

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Mix the 2 flours and stir them in to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a heavy duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional warm place, this will take about 2 hours. However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise, including overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough is ready sooner than needed, punch down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use. Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet. When the dough has completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a floured work surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches wide, 10 inches long, and 1/4-inch thick. It will still be very soft, but try to use a minimum of additional flour in handling it. Roll the dough tight, jelly-roll fashion, into a cylindrical shape. Flatten this to about 1-inch thick and roll it again.

FOR A ROUND LOAF, tuck both ends of the cylinder under to meet in the center, pinching to seal them. Roll the dough around the work surface under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball about 5 inches in diameter.

FOR AN OBLONG LOAF, roll the dough under your hands into a fat cigar shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length. Set the loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely around it. Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.

Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F. Have a water-filled sprayer handy. Slide your hand under the towel, pick up the loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles. Spray water into the oven before closing the door, and spray twice more at 2-minute intervals. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown. The bread should have a hollow sound when you knock on its bottom.

NOTES : There is no mistake in this recipe. Tuscan Bread has no salt, fat or sugar.
On its own, it is pretty tasteless, but makes good company to salty soups and stews.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  walnuts -- (about 1/2 pound)
  1         tablespoon  plus 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  lukewarm water (105 to 115)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour

1. Preheat the oven to 350. Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast
for about 8 minutes, or until deeply browned. Let cool.
2. In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water; let stand until foamy.
Stir in the butter, egg, and salt. Add the all-purpose flour, whole wheat
flour, and walnuts, stirring until the dough becomes stiff. Scrape the dough
onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth dough forms. Transfer
the dough to a lightly oiled large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let
stand in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
3. Punch the dough down and cut it in half. Knead each half briefly and shape
into 6-inch rounds. Set the rounds on a large, lightly oiled baking sheet
about 4 inches apart. Let stand until the rounds are almost doubled in volume
and hold an impression when lightly pressed, about 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 375. Bake the loaves in the center of the oven for
about 50 minutes, or until they are nicely browned and sound hollow when
tapped on the bottom. Transfer to a rack to cool completely before slicing.

MAKE AHEAD: The loaves can be frozen for up to 2 weeks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     envelop of dry yeast
                        -- (approx 1 Tblsp bulk dry yeast)
     1/4           cup  lukewarm water
     1/4           cup  honey
  1 1/4                 hot water
  1              Tblsp  salt
  3               cups  flour
     3/4           cup  wheat germ
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Standard recommends letting the bulk dough rise in a pan of warm water.  I
still sometimes float the bowl in the kitchen sink full of warm water, but
it's kind of a pain.  The bread really enjoys it, but if you have only got
the traditional warm, draft-free place the yeastie-beasties will reproduce
happily there too.  Anyway, enjoy.

Put the yeast, lukewarm water and honey in a bowl, and let mixture become frothy. Mix the hot water with the salt and let it cool to lukewarm. Combine with the yeast mixture and add to the flour and wheat germ. Mix very well and, while mixing, pour the oil over it. More warm water can be added to make a workable dough. Beat it hard in a kneading motion in the bowl for five minutes. Then put the bowl in a dishpan of very warm water, cover with a tea towel, and let the dough rise. Beat down and put the dough in an oiled (sprayed) bread pan to rise again in the same warm place. Preheat oven to 425*.

Bake risen breads for 15 minutes at 425*. Reduce heat to 350* and bake 25 minutes more. If crust is over-browning, turn heat off (leave oven door closed!) the last 10 minutes. If desired, put a pan of water on the bottom of the oven before the high-temperature baking (or drop ice cubes into an empty pan preheated on the oven floor immediately after putting the breads on the oven rack).

If this bread doesn't pop out of the pans nicely, "sweat" it for 10 minutes or so (leave it in the pan, the crust will pull some moisture from the interior of the loaf and "sweat" free of the pan) and it should release nicely. The crust will recover its crispness, don't worry.

NOTES : In response to a question about bread made with cooked oatmeal -- the recipe essentially cooks the oatmeal right then and there; you might try the recipe as written once and find out how much it makes. Then you could surely substitute the good leftovers. (NB to the brewer who wrote last summer looking for what to do with his leftover mash ... this would be a decent starting place! Just remember to go light on further added liquids, depending on how wet the mash is to begin with.)

The olive oil bread is an example of one that WON'T make you gag, though I
still recommend that el-cheapo low-flavor olive oil is safer
even here.  Not to mention the thrift factor!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm water
  1              Tbsp.  active dry yeast -- (1 pkg)
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  2               cups  white flour -- (plus more for
                        kneading)
  1              Tbsp.  salt
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt -- (nonfat is fine)
  2               Tbsp  cornmeal

Dissolve yeast in warm water until foamy. Mix whole wheat & 2 c. all-purpose flour, and salt. Add dry mixture to yeast in three additions. Add yogurt & mix until soft & sticky, about 2 minutes.

Knead on well-floured surface until smooth (this dough may take over a cup of additional flour while kneading). Knead 5-7 minutes. Put into large greased bowl, turn to coat entire dough ball, cover and let rise 1 hour.

Punch down, let rise again (1 hour).

Shape into pizza rounds; place on cornmeal-dusted pans. Top as desired.

Bake at 425F ... 15-20 minutes if mini (personal) sized; 20-30 minutes for 12" pizza.j

Yields 6-8 mini pizzas or 2 12" pizzas. (dough can be frozen (well protected) in pizza pan and topped just before baking ... thaw in refrigerator overnight before topping. I have even frozen it all topped and baked it longer right from the freezer.)

  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        -- or 2 Tbl. dried thyme
                        -- (I use dried)
     1/2          tsp.  salt
     1/2          tsp.  ground sumac -- to taste (1/2 to 1)

Place a small, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sesame seeds and toast, stirring constantly, until they start to change color and give off a slight roasted grain aroma. Remove from the heat, still stirring, then transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Grind the thyme leaves to a coarse powder in a spice or coffee grinder or using a mortar and pestle. Add the sesame seeds and salt, and grind to a powder. Add the sumac. Store in a tightly sealed jar.

Makes approx. 1/4 cup.

Besides making za'atar bread, it can be used as a dip: dip pieces of pita bread into good olive oil, then touch it to the za'atar before each mouthful. Penzey's recommends cutting pita bread into wedges, brushing with olive oil, sprinkling with za'atar, then baking at 350F.

NOTES : The spelling changes (zahtar, zatter,zatar) but it's the same. Just be sure to get the variety that includes thyme. It's also easy to make your own in small quantities, and that way the sesame seeds are always nice and fresh. Here's the recipe from Flatbreads & Flavors by Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid (a great book!). I checked with Joni, and these are the same ingredients that were in the za'atar she used.

     1/4           cup  za'atar spice*
     1/2           tsp  kosher salt
                        Juice of two lemons -- about 1/2 cup juice
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        ---
                        DOUGH

  2               cups  lukewarm water -- (100F to 110F)
  2                tsp  granulated sugar
  2               Tbsp  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  KA Unbleached A-P Flour
  5               cups  KA Special Bread Flour
  1 3/4            tsp  kosher salt
                        DIPPING SAUCE:
                        -- In small individual custard cups or
                        -- whatever is convenient mix:
  1         tablespoon  za'atar spice
  1               Dash  kosher salt
  2        Tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        Tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

CAUTION: Instead of using charcoal grill, I baked the bread in our Kitchen Aid electric oven. The oven should be preheated for at least 30 minutes and it's helpful to use a pizza peel or quarry tiles placed on the upper section of the oven closest to heat source. Place rack 1 position up from the middle. Oven tends to get extremely hot and having to leave the door ajar during broiling can cause the dials to become extremely hot. Because I use a pizza peel that's only 14 inches round I could only bake one loaf at a time. If your using movable quarry tiles perhaps you can bake more than one loaf at a time.

ANOTHER PROBLEM: Fortunately we have many Middle-Eastern groceries in the DC area, in particular, a Lebanese deli and grocery so obtaining the za'atar was no problem for me. Unfortunately I don't know where you can order this mix and I have no idea how one could make it from scratch unless you know all of the ingredients. Perhaps someone on the list has knowledge of a mail-order source. Believe me this bread is worth the search. Za'atar Flatbread

TOPPING: Stir together all the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Whisk together the yeast, water, and sugar. Stir in the oil, the all-purpose flour and most of the bread flour, then the salt. Mix to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, till it's elastic and supple, adding additional flour as needed.

Place the dough in a large, well-greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a tea towel, and let rise until doubled. Alternatively, allow the dough a long, cool rise in the fridge, several hours or overnight (or up to 3 days). Bring the dough to room temperature before shaping; it'll rise as it warms up.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Stretch or roll the pieces into irregular slabs, and let rest for 15 minutes, covered with a tea towel. Spread some olive oil/za'atar mixture onto each piece of dough.

Preheat the grill to its hottest temperature. Place the flatbreads gently on the grill. Cover and bake for 1 to 2 minutes, then check for doneness. Allow to bake until the tops begin to brown. Brush with additional topping if desired, and remove from the grill.
[SERVE IMMEDIATELY, IF POSSIBLE jtr]

YIELD: 8 large, irregular-shaped flatbreads

Half recipe: As revised in ZA'ATAR, LEMON And OIL TOPPING recipe. Note: Used less flour than recipe called for. This is a very soft, slack dough.

METHOD: Kitchen Aid Mixer. Followed instructions as written in ZA'ATAR, LEMON And OIL TOPPING recipe, but added salt after rest period (20 minutes after mixing). Kneaded in KA for 3 minutes, rested and kneaded by hand 2 minutes or less. Added only a little more flour during 1st knead, total amount about 2 cups.

Covered bowl with plastic wrap and kitchen towel; refrigerated overnight. Removed from refrigerator about 1:15 PM, punched down, rolled into a ball and covered to rise in dining room.

Rising time: 2 hours (warm in dining room approximately 80 Scaled dough = 1 lb 4 1/4 ozs

Divided dough into quarters. Rolled out as directed. [NOTE: dough fought back. Next time allow dough to rest 10 minutes before cutting and shaping or I'll add some of Lora Brody's Dough Relaxer.] Placed on greased parchment, covered 15-20 minutes. Poured on topping sauce. Next time don't let it pool so much in center, excess oil causes bread not to bake completely.

Baked: IN OVEN: Preheated oven 500F 35 minutes. Raised rack, placed pizza stone on rack during preheat. Baked each piece individually 2 minutes at BAKE, 3 minutes at BROIL.

Oven dials became excessively hot due to opening door during broiling periods.

Removed from oven, placed on cooling rack. Brushed oil that had accumulated in center of loaves around the tops of the loaves.

To serve: If not eating immediately, preheat oven (with pizza stone) to 400F . Place baked bread on stone and turn off heat. Allow bread to remain in oven about 10 minutes to reheat.
